<p><a class="sc" id="sc.up2.071.1"></a>“ Monks, whatever the causes and whatever the conditions for the arising of bodily form(s), these are just impermanent. How could bodily form(s) that have come into being in dependence upon impermanent causes and conditions themselves be permanent? Whatever the causes and whatever the conditions for the arising of feeling, perception, formations and consciousness, these are just impermanent. How could consciousness that has come into being in dependence upon impermanent causes and conditions be permanent?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.up2.071.2"></a>“Monks, bodily form, feeling, perception, formations and consciousness are impermanent. Whatever is impermanent, that is <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>. What is impermanent, that is <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>. What is <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>, that is not-self. What is not-self should be seen with right wisdom as ‘this is not me, this cannot be grasped as mine, this cannot be grasped as my own self.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.up2.071.3"></a>“Monks, a learned noble disciple who contemplate in this way will become disenchanted with regard to bodily form(s), and will likewise become disenchanted with regard to feeling, perception, formations and consciousness. When he has become disenchanted, he will be free from desire. When he is free from desire, he will be liberated. When he is liberated, knowledge and vision of complete liberation <span class="insertion">arise, namely that</span> ‘Birth for me has been exhausted. The holy life has been fulfilled. What had to be done has been done. Existence other than the present one shall not be known <span class="insertion">by me</span>.’ Thus it was said.”</p>

<p>The narrative introduction is Sāvatthī.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.up2.078.1"></a>At that time a certain monk arising from deep meditation went to the place where the Blessed One was abiding, arrived, paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet and sat to one side. Sitting to one side, he addressed the Blessed One with the following words: “Venerable sir, a monk attains nirvāṇa here and now. Just in what measure is a monk declared one who attains nirvāṇa here and now? Venerable sir, how is it that a monk attains nirvāṇa here and now? Just in what measure the Well-gone One has made the declaration that a monk is one who attains nirvāṇa here and now?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.up2.078.2"></a><span class="insertion">That monk</span> asked this question and the Blessed One replied with these words to that monk: “It is well, monk, it is well. Monk, you <span class="insertion">now</span> ask a question like this, to what extent the declaration is made earlier of one who is said to attain nirvāṇa here and now. Monk, is this the question you ask?” “Yes, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.up2.078.3"></a><span class="insertion">The Blessed One said:</span> “Therefore, monk, listen carefully and keep in mind keep <span class="insertion">it</span> in mind, and I shall explain. A monk turns away from form, is free from desire <span class="insertion">for it</span>, <span class="insertion">proceeds towards</span> cessation, has no clinging, and abides <span class="insertion">having attained</span> complete liberation of the mind from the influxes such a one can be defined a monk who attains nirvāṇa here and now. <span class="insertion">A monk</span> turns away from form, feeling, perception, consciousness, is free from desire <span class="insertion">for them</span>, <span class="insertion">proceeds towards</span> cessation, has no clinging, and abides <span class="insertion">having attained</span> complete liberation of the mind from the influxes such a one can be defined a monk who attains nirvāṇa here and now. Monk, just in this measure a monk is declared one who attains nirvāṇa here and now. Monk, just in this measure the Well-gone One has made the declaration that a monk is one who attains nirvāṇa here and now.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.up2.078.4"></a>Then, on hearing what the Blessed One had said, that monk was greatly delighted in his mind, and after paying homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, he left the presence of the Blessed One.</p>
