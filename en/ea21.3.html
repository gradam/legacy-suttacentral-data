<h1>Ekottarāgama 21.3</h1>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.3.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then the Exalted One said to the bhikṣus:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.3.2"></a>“There are three conditions (<i lang="pi">kāraṇa</i>) for consciousness to receive a womb (<i lang="pi">garbha</i>). Which are the three? Now there are, O bhikṣus, a) the mother wishing to have sexual intercourse (<i lang="pi">maithunecchā</i>), b) the father and mother coming together in one place and spending the night together. However, c) it is not the occasion for consciousness “from outside” (<i lang="pi">bāhyāt</i>) to <span class="supplied">be instrumental in</span> bringing about rebirth (<i lang="pi">gati</i>), and consequently an embryo cannot develop.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.3.3"></a>“Moreover, if there is a) lust (<i lang="pi">rāga</i>) and if b) consciousness <span class="supplied">“from outside”</span> presents itself, but if c) there is no union of the father and mother then an embryo cannot develop.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.3.4"></a>“If, furthermore, a) the mother does not wish <span class="supplied">to have sexual intercourse</span>, but if b) the father and mother come together in one place and if c) the former is keen on having sexual intercourse whilst the latter is listless, then an embryo cannot develop.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.3.5"></a>“If, again, a) the father and mother come together … and if b) the latter is burning with lust whilst c) the former is listless, then an embryo cannot develop.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.3.6"></a>“If a) the father and mother come together…, but if b) the father is wanting in sexual desire and if c) the mother is frigid, then an embryo cannot develop.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.3.7"></a>“If a) the father and mother come together … but if b) the latter is wanting in sexual desire and if c) the former is icy, then an embryo cannot develop.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.3.8"></a>“If occasionally a) the father and mother come together … and if b) the former very much suffers from dropsy while c) the latter does not, then an embryo cannot develop.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.3.9"></a>“If occasionally a) the father and mother come together…, but if b) the former is looking <span class="supplied">forward</span> to having offspring while c) the latter is not, then an embryo cannot develop.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.3.10"></a>“If occasionally a) the father and mother<a class="t" id="tT2_603a"></a> come together … but if b) the latter is looking <span class="supplied">forward</span> to having offspring while c) the former is not, then an embryo cannot develop.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.3.11"></a>“If at times neither the father nor mother are not looking <span class="supplied">forward</span> to having offspring then … If at times the consciousness-genius is coming into the womb, but if the father <span class="supplied">then</span> is not ready to have sex (<i lang="pi">āgamana</i>) then an embryo cannot develop.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.3.12"></a>“If at times the father and mother, as required, come together in one place, but if the mother <span class="supplied">then</span> draws back from having sex then an embryo cannot develop.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.3.13"></a>“Further, if at times the father and mother, as required, come together at one place, but if the father meets with a serious accident <span class="supplied">even though</span> the consciousness-genius is present, then an embryo cannot develop.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.3.14"></a>“If again at times the father and mother, as required, come together … and <span class="supplied">even though</span> the consciousness-genius is present, but if the mother meets with a serious accident then an embryo cannot develop.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.3.15"></a>“If, moreover, occasionally the father and mother … come together … and the consciousness-genius is present, but if both father and mother are taken ill then an embryo cannot develop.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.3.16"></a>“If, however, bhikṣus, a) the father and mother come together in one place and b) both of them are in no <span class="supplied">way</span> afflicted and if c) in the presence of the consciousness-genius the parents are looking <span class="supplied">forward</span> to having a child then an embryo can develop.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.3.17"></a>“These are the three conditions, bhikṣus, for <span class="supplied">consciousness</span> to receive a womb. On account of that, bhikṣus, <span class="supplied">all those who wish to overcome Samsara</span> ought to search for skills in means (<i lang="pi">upāyakauśalya</i>) to make the three conditions end (<i lang="pi">ud-</i>√<i lang="pi">chid</i>). Thus, bhikṣus, you should train. After listening to the Buddha’s words, the bhikṣus were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.”</p>
