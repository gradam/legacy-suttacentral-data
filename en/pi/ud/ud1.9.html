<h1>The Discourse about Those with Knotted Hair</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Gayā, on Gayā Peak. Then at that time many knotted-haired ascetics, in the cold Winter nights, in between ‘the eights’, at the time of the snowfall, in the Gayā <span class="supplied">river</span>, were plunging out, and plunging in, were plunging out and in, were sprinkling <span class="supplied">water</span>, and were offering the fire sacrifice, <span class="supplied">thinking</span>: “Through this there is purity.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>The Gracious One saw that those many knotted-haired ascetics, in the Winter nights, in between ‘the eights’, at the time of the snowfall, in the Gayā <span class="supplied">river</span>, were plunging out and plunging in, were plunging out and in, were sprinkling <span class="supplied">water</span>, and were offering the fire sacrifice, <span class="supplied">thinking</span>: “Through this there is purity.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Not through water is there purity—many people bathe here!<br>
In whom there is truth and Dhamma, he is pure, and he is a brāhmaṇa.”</p>
