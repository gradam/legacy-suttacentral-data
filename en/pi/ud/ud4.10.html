<h1>The Discourse about Sāriputta</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then at that time venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far away from the Gracious One, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, reflecting on his own peacefulness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>The Gracious One saw that venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far away, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, was reflecting on his own peacefulness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“For the monk whose peaceful mind is full of peace, for the one who has cut off what leads <span class="supplied">to rebirth</span>,<br>
Having totally destroyed the round of births, he is free from the bonds of Māra.”</p>
