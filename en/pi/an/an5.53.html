<h1>53 Factors</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these five factors that assist striving. What five?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>(1) “Here, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith. He places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus: ‘The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>(2) “He is seldom ill or afflicted, possessing an even digestion that is neither too cool nor too hot but moderate and suitable for striving.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>(3) “He is honest and open, one who reveals himself as he really is to the Teacher and his wise fellow monks.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>(4) “He has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>(5) “He is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“These, bhikkhus, are the five factors that assist striving.”</p>
