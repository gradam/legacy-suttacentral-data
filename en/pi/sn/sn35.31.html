<h3>Connected Discourses on the Six Sense Bases</h3>
<h1>31. Suitable for Uprooting (1)</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the way that is suitable for uprooting all conceivings. Listen to that….</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the way that is suitable for uprooting all conceivings? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu does not conceive the eye, does not conceive in the eye, does not conceive from the eye, does not conceive, ‘The eye is mine.’ He does not conceive forms … eye-consciousness … eye-contact … and as to whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—he does not conceive that, does not conceive in that, does not conceive from that, does not conceive, ‘That is mine.’ For, bhikkhus, whatever one conceives, whatever one conceives in, whatever one conceives from, whatever one conceives as ‘mine’—that is otherwise. The world, becoming otherwise, attached to becoming, seeks delight only in becoming.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“He does not conceive the ear … <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.24"></a> … He does not conceive the mind … and as to whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition … he does not conceive that, does not conceive in that, does not conceive from that, does not conceive, ‘That is mine.’ For, bhikkhus, whatever one conceives, whatever one conceives in, whatever one conceives from, whatever one conceives as ‘mine’—that is otherwise. The world, becoming otherwise, attached to becoming, seeks delight only in becoming.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Whatever, bhikkhus, is the extent of the aggregates, the elements, and the sense bases, he does not conceive that, does not conceive in that, does not conceive from that, does not conceive, ‘That is mine.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Since he does not conceive anything thus, he does not cling to anything in the world. Not clinging, he is not agitated. Being unagitated, he personally attains Nibbana. He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“This, bhikkhus, is the way that is suitable for uprooting all conceivings.”</p>
