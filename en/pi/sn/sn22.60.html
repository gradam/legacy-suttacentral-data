</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesali in the Great Wood in the Hall with the Peaked Roof. Then Mahali the Licchavi approached the Blessed One <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iii.69"></a> … and said to him:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Venerable sir, Pūraṇa Kassapa speaks thus: ‘There is no cause or condition for the defilement of beings; beings are defiled without cause or condition. There is no cause or condition for the purification of beings; beings are purified without cause or condition. ’ What does the Blessed One say about this?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“There is, Mahali, a cause and condition for the defilement of beings; beings are defiled with cause and condition. There is a cause and condition for the purification of beings; beings are purified with cause and condition.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“But, venerable sir, what is the cause and condition for the defilement of beings? How is it that beings are defiled with cause and condition?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“If, Mahali, this form were exclusively suffering, immersed in suffering, steeped in suffering, and if it were not <span class="add show">also</span> steeped in pleasure, beings would not become enamoured with it. But because form is pleasurable, immersed in pleasure, steeped in pleasure, and is not steeped <span class="add show">only</span> in suffering, beings become enamoured with it. By being enamoured with it, they are captivated by it, and by being captivated by it they are defiled. This, Mahali, is a cause and condition for the defilement of beings; it is thus that beings are defiled with cause and condition.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“If, Mahali, this feeling were exclusively suffering … If this perception … these volitional formations … <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iii.70"></a> … this consciousness were exclusively suffering … beings would not become enamoured with it. But because consciousness is pleasurable … beings become enamoured with it. By being enamoured with it, they are captivated by it, and by being captivated by it they are defiled. This too, Mahali, is a cause and condition for the defilement of beings; it is thus that beings are defiled with cause and condition.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“But, venerable sir, what is the cause and condition for the purification of beings? How is it that beings are purified with cause and condition?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“If, Mahali, this form were exclusively pleasurable, immersed in pleasure, steeped in pleasure, and if it were not <span class="add show">also</span> steeped in suffering, beings would not experience revulsion towards it. But because form is suffering, immersed in suffering, steeped in suffering, and is not steeped <span class="add show">only</span> in pleasure, beings experience revulsion towards it. Experiencing revulsion, they become dispassionate, and through dispassion they are purified. This, Mahali, is a cause and condition for the purification of beings; it is thus that beings are purified with cause and condition.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“If, Mahali, this feeling were exclusively pleasurable … If this perception … these volitional formations … this consciousness were exclusively pleasurable … beings would not experience revulsion towards it. But because consciousness is suffering … beings experience revulsion towards it. Experiencing revulsion, they become dispassionate, and through dispassion they are purified. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iii.71"></a> This too, Mahali, is a cause and condition for the purification of beings; it is thus that beings are purified with cause and condition.”</p>
