<h3>Connected Discourses on the Unconditioned</h3>
<h1>44. The Destination</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the destination and the path leading to the destination. Listen to that….</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the destination? The destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of delusion: this is called the destination.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the path leading to the destination? Mindfulness directed to the body: this is called the path leading to the destination.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Thus, bhikkhus, I have taught you the destination and the path leading to the destination. Whatever should be done, bhikkhus, by a compassionate teacher out of compassion for his disciples, desiring their welfare, that I have done for you. These are the feet of trees, bhikkhus, these are empty huts. Meditate, bhikkhus, do not be negligent, lest you regret it later. This is our instruction to you.”</p>
