<h3>Connected Discourses on Causation</h3>
<h1>3. The Two Ways</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you the wrong way and the right way. Listen to that and attend closely, I will speak.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the wrong way? With ignorance as condition, volitional formations <span class="add show">come to be</span>; with volitional formations as condition, consciousness…. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. This, bhikkhus, is called the wrong way. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.5"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the right way? With the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations; with the cessation of volitional formations, cessation of consciousness…. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering. This, bhikkhus, is called the right way.”</p>
