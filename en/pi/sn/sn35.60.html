</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the Dhamma for the full understanding of all clinging. Listen to that….</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma for the full understanding of all clinging? In dependence on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as condition, feeling <span class="add show">comes to be</span>. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.33"></a> Seeing thus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards the eye, towards forms, towards eye-consciousness, towards eye-contact, towards feeling. Experiencing revulsion, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion <span class="add show">the mind</span> is liberated. With its deliverance he understands: ‘Clinging has been fully understood by me.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“In dependence on the ear and sounds … In dependence on the mind and mental phenomena, mind-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact.
