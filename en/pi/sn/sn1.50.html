Who, having left the human body,<br>
Have overcome the celestial bond?”</p>

It was not apart from your Teaching!<br>

Stops without remainder:<br>
By understanding that Dhamma here<br>
They cut through the bondage of existence.”</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a> “In the past I was the potter,<br>
Ghaṭikara in Vehaḷiṅga.<br>
I supported my mother and father then<br>
As a lay follower of the Buddha Kassapa. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.i.36"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a> “I abstained from sexual intercourse,<br>
I was celibate, free from carnal ties.<br>
I was your fellow villager,<br>
In the past I was your friend.</p>

These seven liberated bhikkhus,<br>
Who with lust and hatred utterly destroyed<br>
Have crossed over attachment to the world.”</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a> “Just so it was at that time,<br>
As you say, O Bhaggava:<br>
In the past you were the potter,<br>
Ghaṭikara in Vehaḷiṅga.<br>
You supported your mother and father then<br>
As a lay follower of the Buddha Kassapa.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a> “You abstained from sexual intercourse,<br>
You were celibate, free from carnal ties.<br>
You were my fellow villager,<br>
In the past you were my friend.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a> Such was the meeting that took place<br>
Between those friends from the past,<br>
Both now inwardly developed,<br>
Bearers of their final bodies.</p>
