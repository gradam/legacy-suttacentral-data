<h3>Connected Discourses with Mara</h3>
<h1>9. Life Span (1)</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Bhikkhus, this life span of human beings is short. One has to go on to the future life. One should do what is wholesome and lead the holy life; for one who has taken birth there is no avoiding death. One who lives long, bhikkhus, lives a hundred years or a little longer.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Then Mara the Evil One approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a> “Long is the life span of human beings,<br>
The good man should not disdain it.<br>
One should live like a milk-sucking baby:<br>
Death has not made its arrival.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="add show">The Blessed One:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a> “Short is the life span of human beings,<br>
The good man should disdain it.<br>
One should live like one with head aflame:<br>
There is no avoiding Death’s arrival.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Mara the Evil One … disappeared right there.</p>
