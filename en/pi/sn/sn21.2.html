<h3>Connected Discourses with Bhikkhus</h3>
<h1>2. Upatissa</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthi. There the Venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Friends, bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Friend!” those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sariputta said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Here, friends, when I was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in my mind thus: ‘Is there anything in the world through the change and alteration of which sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair might arise in me?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘There is nothing in the world through the change and alteration of which sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair might arise in me.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>When this was said, the Venerable Ananda said to the Venerable Sariputta: “Friend Sariputta, even if the Teacher himself were to undergo change and alteration, wouldn’t sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair arise in you?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Friend, even if the Teacher himself were to undergo change and alteration, still sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair would not arise in me. However, it would occur to me: ‘The Teacher, so influential, so powerful and mighty, has passed away. If the Blessed One had lived for a long time, that would have been for the welfare and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans.’” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.275"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“It must be because I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to conceit have been thoroughly uprooted in the Venerable Sariputta for a long time that even if the Teacher himself were to undergo change and alteration, still sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair would not arise in him.”</p>
