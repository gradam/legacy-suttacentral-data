<h1>85. Empty Is the World</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>Then the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One … and said to him: “Venerable sir, it is said, ‘Empty is the world, empty is the world.’ In what way, venerable sir, is it said, ‘Empty is the world’?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“It is, Ananda, because it is empty of self and of what belongs to self that it is said, ‘Empty is the world.’ And what is empty of self and of what belongs to self? The eye, Ananda, is empty of self and of what belongs to self. Forms are empty of self and of what belongs to self. Eye-consciousness is empty of self and of what belongs to self. Eye-contact is empty of self and of what belongs to self…. Whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is empty of self and of what belongs to self.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“It is, Ananda, because it is empty of self and of what belongs to self that it is said, ‘Empty is the world.’”</p>
