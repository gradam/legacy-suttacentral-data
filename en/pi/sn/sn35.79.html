<h1>79. Abandoning Ignorance (1)</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One … and said to him: “Venerable sir, is there one thing through the abandoning of which ignorance is abandoned by a bhikkhu and true knowledge arises?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“There is one thing, bhikkhu, through the abandoning of which ignorance is abandoned by a bhikkhu and true knowledge arises.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“And what is that one thing, venerable sir?” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.50"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Ignorance, bhikkhu, is that one thing through the abandoning of which ignorance is abandoned by a bhikkhu and true knowledge arises.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“But, venerable sir, how should a bhikkhu know, how should he see, for ignorance to be abandoned by him and true knowledge to arise?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Bhikkhu, when a bhikkhu knows and sees the eye as impermanent, ignorance is abandoned by him and true knowledge arises. When he knows and sees forms as impermanent … When he knows and sees as impermanent whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition … ignorance is abandoned by him and true knowledge arises.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“When, bhikkhu, a bhikkhu knows and sees thus, ignorance is abandoned by him and true knowledge arises.”</p>
