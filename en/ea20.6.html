Then the Exalted One said to the bhikṣus: <p>“There are person(s) who are lazy (<i lang="pi">kusīda</i>), who do not embark on virtuous actions (<i lang="pi">sucarita</i>) and who in their deeds (<i lang="pi">kriyā</i>) meet with misfortune (<i lang="pi">vyasana</i>); on the other hand, there are those who are capable of not <span class="insertion">succumbing to</span> laziness, who put effort (<i lang="pi">vīrya</i>) into <span class="insertion">what is to be done</span> and who are most accomplished (<i lang="pi">praṇīta</i>) in respect of all that is karmically wholesome so that there is an increase in what is <span class="insertion">truly</span> advantageous. </p>
<p>“Thus <span class="insertion">with reference to the latter persons</span> it will take the bodhisattva Maitreya thirty aeons until he becomes a Buddha by realising full and complete enlightenment. All on his own (<i lang="pi">ātmanā</i>) he will make use of the force of effort (<i lang="pi">vīryabala</i>) and utmost determination so that in future <span class="insertion">he</span>, Maitreya, will be <span class="insertion">my successor</span>. </p>
<p>“Also in the past, innumerable beings, like the sands of the <span class="insertion">River</span> Gangā, <span class="insertion">became</span> foremost arhats, Fully and Completely Enlightened Ones. All of them succeeded in realising Buddhahood on account of their utmost determination. </p>
<p>“With the help of this ‘skill in means’ (<i lang="pi">upāyakauśalya</i>) one should know that laziness is conducive to suffering, leads to miserable destinies (<i lang="pi">durgati</i>) and in one’s deeds one will meet with misfortune. If <span class="insertion">on the other hand</span> one is capable of utmost determination and of putting forth effort, all that is karmically wholesome, all virtues <span class="insertion">will be accomplished</span> so that there will be an increase in what is <span class="insertion">truly</span> advantageous. </p>
<p>“Therefore, O bhikṣus, you should be mindful of putting forth effort and do not be negligent. Thus, bhikṣus, you should train.” </p>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the bhikṣus were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
