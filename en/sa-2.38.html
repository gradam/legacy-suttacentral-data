<h3>Sakka Saṃyutta</h3>
<h1>Sakka debates with Vepacitti</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.38.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.38.2"></a>At that time the World-honored One told the monks: “A long time ago Sakka Devānaṃ Inda, leader of the gods, was about to do battle with the <i>asura</i>s. At that time Sakka Devānaṃ Inda said to Vepacitti, king of the <i>asura</i>s: “We should not lead our armies to harm each other, but instead should debate, and thus decide who wins and who loses.” Vepacitti said to Sakka Devānaṃ Inda: “Kosiya, if we were to debate, who would determine the winner and the loser?” Sakka Devānaṃ Inda said: “In both our armies there are people who are intelligent, of wise judgment, able to tell good from bad, and to decide who will be the winner and who the loser.” Vepacitti said: “You speak first, Sakka!” <span class="supplied">But</span> Sakka answered: “My turn will come. You are the older <i>deva</i>. You speak first.” And Vepacitti spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.38.3"></a>“If I were to tolerate transgressions /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the foolish would say of my patient manner:<br>
‘His patience is born of fear’ /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and deem themselves superior.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In reply Sakka Devānaṃ Inda spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.38.4"></a>“Though the other might call it fear /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and <span class="supplied">think</span> he has gained the upper hand,<br>
precious treasures and all benefits /<br><span class="indent">​</span><span class="supplied">are for those</span> invincible ones who are patient when insulted.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Vepacitti spoke another verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.38.5"></a>“The foolish have no wisdom /<br><span class="indent">​</span>they have to be restrained.<br><span class="supplied">They are</span> like a cow at the rear /<br><span class="indent">​</span>attempting to stampede over those ones in front of it on the path.<br>
The knife and cudgel are necessary /<br><span class="indent">​</span>to reign in fools.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sakka Devānaṃ Inda answered with this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.38.6"></a>“I believe that for restraining the foolish /<br><span class="indent">​</span>silent patience is the best.<br><span class="supplied">When</span> extreme hatred or anger or rage /<br><span class="indent">​</span>is suffered patiently, the other <span class="supplied">party</span> will naturally calm down.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.38.7"></a>Those without anger, without violence, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>those are noble ones,<br>
They are disciples of noble ones; /<br><span class="indent">​</span>those one should always befriend.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.38.8"></a>For those filled with hatred and anger, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>their hatred is an obstacle heavy as a mountain.<br>
But if, at a time of hatred and anger, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>one can restrain oneself even a little,<br>
then that is called good karma /<br><span class="indent">​</span>like reining in an unruly horse.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.38.9"></a>The wise among the gods and the <i>asura</i>s debated this thoroughly, weighing up who had won and who had lost. <span class="supplied">They agreed</span> that the <span class="supplied">king of the</span> <i>asura</i>s had spoken in favor of strife and battle, while Sakka Devānaṃ Inda <span class="supplied">had spoken for</span> ending quarrels, his mind not favoring angry contest. Thus, the <i>asura</i> <span class="supplied">king</span> lost and Sakka won.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.38.10"></a>The Buddha told the monks: “Sakka Devānaṃ Inda, who rules freely in <span class="supplied">the Tāvatiṃsa</span> heaven, has during the long night <span class="supplied">of <i>saṃsāra</i></span> patiently suffered insults, now extols the way of patience. You too, monks, should bear insults patiently, and extol those who are patient. This is called living the homeless life.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.38.11"></a>When the Buddha had finished speaking, the monks, having heard what he had said, were happy and bore it well in mind remembered it well.</p>
