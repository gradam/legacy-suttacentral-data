<h3>Connected Discourses with Sakka</h3>
<h1>1. Suvira</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthı̄ in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Bhikkhus, once in the past the asuras marched against the devas. Then Sakka, lord of the devas, addressed Suvı̄ra, a young deva, thus: ‘Dear Suvı̄ra, these asuras are marching against the devas. Go, dear Suvı̄ra, launch a counter-march against the asuras.’ - ‘Yes, your lordship,’ Suvı̄ra replied, but he became negligent. A second time Sakka addressed Suvı̄ra … … but a second time Suvı̄ra became negligent. A third time Sakka addressed Suvı̄ra … but a third time Suvı̄ra became negligent. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.i.217"></a> Then, bhikkhus, Sakka addressed Suvı̄ra in verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a> “‘Where one need not toil and strive<br>
Yet still may attain to bliss:<br>
Go there, Suvı̄ra,<br>
And take me along with you.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="add show">Suvı̄ra:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a> “‘That a lazy man who does not toil<br>
Nor attend to his duties<br>
Might still have all desires fulfilled:<br>
Grant me that, Sakka, as a boon.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="add show">Sakka:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a> “‘Where a lazy man who does not toil<br>
Might achieve unending bliss:<br>
Go there, Suvı̄ra,<br>
And take me along with you.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="add show">Suvı̄ra:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a> “‘The bliss, supreme deva, we might find<br>
Without doing work, O Sakka,<br>
The sorrowless state without despair:<br>
Grant me that, Sakka, as a boon.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="add show">Sakka:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a> “‘If there exists any place anywhere<br>
Where without work one won’t decline,<br>
That is indeed Nibbana’s path:<br>
Go there, Suvı̄ra,<br>
And take me along with you.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“So, bhikkhus, if Sakka, lord of the devas, subsisting on the fruit of his own merit, exercising supreme sovereignty and rulership over the Tavatiṃsa devas, will be one who speaks in praise of initiative and energy, then how much more would it be fitting here for you, who have gone forth in such a well-expounded Dhamma and Discipline, to toil, struggle, and strive for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.”</p>
