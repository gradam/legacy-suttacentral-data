<h3>Connected Discourses on the Path</h3>
<h1>57–62. Accomplishment in Virtue, Etc.</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, this is the forerunner and precursor of the rising of the sun, that is, the dawn. So too, bhikkhus, for a bhikkhu this is the forerunner and precursor for the arising of the Noble Eightfold Path, that is, accomplishment in virtue ... <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.32"></a> … accomplishment in desire ... accomplishment in self ... accomplishment in view ... accomplishment in diligence … accomplishment in careful attention. When a bhikkhu is accomplished in careful attention, it is to be expected that he will develop and cultivate this Noble Eightfold Path.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And how does a bhikkhu who is accomplished in careful attention develop and cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view, which has as its final goal the removal of lust, the removal of hatred, the removal of delusion…. He develops right concentration, which has as its final goal the removal of lust, the removal of hatred, the removal of delusion. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu who is accomplished in careful attention develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path.”</p>
