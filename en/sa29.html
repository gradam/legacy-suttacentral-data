<h1 class="supplied">Discourse on Samiddhi Asking How to Speak as a Dharma Teacher</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa29.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time a certain monk by the name of Samiddhi approached the Buddha, paid homage with his head at the <span class="supplied">Buddha’s</span> feet and withdrew to stand at one side. He said to the Buddha: “As the Blessed One has spoken about speaking as a Dharma teacher how is one reckoned to be speaking as a Dharma teacher?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa29.2"></a>The Buddha said to the monk: “You now wish to know the meaning of speaking as a Dharma teacher. Is it like this?” The monk said to the Buddha: “Indeed, Blessed One.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa29.3"></a>The Buddha said to the monk: “Listen and pay careful attention to what I will tell you. If a monk speaks of disenchantment in regard to form, of being free from desire for it, of its cessation, this is reckoned speaking as a Dharma teacher. In the same way speaking of disenchantment in regard to feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, of being free from desire for it, of its cessation, this is reckoned speaking as a Dharma teacher.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa29.4"></a>Then that monk, hearing what the Buddha had said, was thrilled with delight, paid homage and left.</p>
