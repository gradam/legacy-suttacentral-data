<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-33.2"></a>At that time the Buddha told the monks: “Steadfastly maintaining the seven practices one is bound to be reborn as <span class="supplied">a</span> Sakka <span class="supplied">king of gods</span>. Why so? In former times, when <span class="supplied">any</span> Sakka was a human being, he set out to cultivate these beginner’s practices.

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-34.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying in the great hall on the shore of the Monkey<span class="supplied">-lake</span> near Vesāli. There was a Licchavi, by the name of Mahāli, who came to the Buddha, paid homage to his feet and addressed him: “World-honored One, have you seen Sakka?”</p>
<p>The Buddha said: “I have seen him.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-34.2"></a>The Licchavi addressed him: “There are <i>yakkha</i>s who look like Sakka. Might it be that the World-honored One saw such a <i>yakkha</i> instead?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-34.3"></a>The Buddha told the Licchavi: “I am well acquainted with Sakka’s appearance. I also know that there are <i>yakkha</i>s who look like Sakka. I also fully know his deeds in previous lives. When Sakka was a human being, he was obedient to his parents, he respected his elders, his speech was gentle, without slander, he had done away with avarice, he always loved to give, he always spoke truthfully, he had done away with anger, and he did not give rise to hatred.”</p>
<p>At that time the Buddha spoke a verse:</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-35.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-35.2"></a>At that time there was a monk who approached, paid homage at his feet, stood to one side and said to the Buddha: “World-honored One, where does the name ‘Sakka’ come from? What are the characteristics of Sakka?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-35.3"></a>The Buddha told the monk: “Originally, when Sakka was still a human being, he generously made offerings, led a pure life, and his mind was faithful. With a faithful mind he made offerings to the poor, renunciants, <i>brāhmaṇa</i>s, and so on. When he made offerings, he offered drinks and refreshments, all kinds of hard and soft food, all kinds of garlands, all kinds of fragrance, incense, perfume, riches, and bedding. For this reason the gods called him Sakka.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-35.4"></a>Again the monk addressed the Buddha: “Why is Sakka called ‘Purindada’?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-35.5"></a>The Buddha told the monk: “When Sakka, in former times, was born as a human being, he untiringly made offerings. Again and again he made offerings, therefore the gods called him by the name ‘Purindada’ <span class="supplied">He who gives repeatedly</span>.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-35.6"></a>Again the monk addressed the Buddha: “And for what reason is Sakka also called ‘Maghavā’?”.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-35.7"></a>The Buddha told the monk: “Sakka was originally a <i>brāhmaṇa</i> called ‘Maghavā.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-35.8"></a>Again <span class="supplied">the monk</span> asked: “For what reason is he called ‘Vāsava’?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-35.9"></a>The Buddha said: “Because again and again he offered clothes to renunciants and <i>brāhmaṇa</i>s. For that reason he was called ‘Vāsava’ <span class="supplied">the Clother</span>.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-35.10"></a>Again <span class="supplied">the monk</span> asked: “For what reason is he called ‘Kosiya’?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-35.11"></a>The Buddha said: “Because originally when Sakka was a human being, his clan-name was “Kosiya.” Therefore he is called ‘Kosiya.’”</p>
<p>“And why is he called ‘Sujampati’?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-35.12"></a>The Buddha told the monk: “Sakka married <span class="supplied">Sujā</span> the daughter of the <i>asura</i> king Vepacitti. Therefore he is known as ‘Sujampati’ <span class="supplied">Sujā’s husband</span>.”</p>
<p>“And why is he called ‘Thousand-Eyed’?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-35.13"></a>The Buddha told the monk: “When Sakka was a human being, he was extremely intelligent. When he had to make decisions, he could decide a thousand things in a short time. For that reason he is called ‘Thousand Eyed.’”</p>
<p>“And why is he called ‘Indra’?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-35.14"></a>The Buddha told the monk: “Sakka holds the position of king of gods, he is in charge of their affairs. Therefore he is called ‘Indra.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-35.15"></a>At that time the World-honored One said to the monk: “He was able to fulfill the seven duties <span class="supplied">mentioned</span> above. Because of that, the other gods call him ‘Sakka.’”</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-36.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-36.2"></a>At that time the World-honored One told the monks: “There was once a <i>yakkha</i>, who was short in stature, whose face was ugly, and whose complexion was black. People did not like the sight of him. <span class="supplied">This <i>yakkha</i> once</span> seated himself on Sakka’s seat. When the thirty-three gods saw the <i>yakkha</i> sitting in Sakka’s place, they all became very angry, and insulted him in various ways. Then, the ugly aspects of the <i>yakkha</i> slowly diminished, he became attractive and grew taller. The gods abused and cursed him and became more and more angry. The <i>yakkha</i> in turn grew even taller and more beautiful. The gods went to Sakka and told him: “There is a <i>yakkha</i>, extremely ugly and short, who sits in your place. We, the gods, abused him severely, and the <i>yakkha</i>’s form became beautiful, his body grew taller!” Sakka said: “There is this <i>yakkha</i>, who on receiving abuse turns beautiful, he is called ‘On the Side of Anger.’” Thereupon Sakka went to his seat, knelt with his cloth arranged over one shoulder, folded his hands, offered incense and spoke to the <i>yakkha</i>: “Great seer! I am Sakka. I am Sakka.” After Sakka had uttered his name thrice, the <i>yakkha</i> became small and ugly again and finally vanished. Sakka resumed his seat and said to the gods: “From now on, let none of you generate anger. If there is hostility, be careful not to add anger to it.” And he spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-36.3"></a>“If someone comes and utters insults, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>let no one return these insults to him.<br>
Towards those who come to attack and to harm, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>let everyone generate loving-kindness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-36.4"></a>Those without anger, without violence, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>one should always befriend.<br>
For they are noble ones, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>they are disciples of noble ones.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-36.5"></a>Those with anger and hatred /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>are blocked by that anger <span class="supplied">as if by</span> a mountain.<br>
But if, when there is anger and hatred, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>one can control oneself even a little,<br>
then this is called a wholesome state /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>like the taming of an unruly horse.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-36.6"></a>The Buddha told the monks: “Sakka is the king of gods, enjoying all kinds of pleasure. He can control his anger and praises those who control their anger. How much more should you, monks, who, out of faith have gone forth from home into homelessness, gone forth and pursued the way, you, who have shaved off hair and beard and donned the robes, how much more should you control anger and praise those who control their anger! In this way, monks, you should practice!”</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-37.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-37.2"></a>At that time, early one morning, the World-honored One took his robes and his begging bowl and entered the town to beg for food. Having eaten he washed his feet, gathered his seat <span class="supplied">for meditation</span> and went to the Andhavana forest <span class="supplied">to meditate</span>. Having looked around <span class="supplied">for a good spot</span>, he sat down cross-legged beneath a tree in a secluded place, for the day’s abiding.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-37.3"></a>At that time in the Jeta Vihāra there were two monks who got into an argument during a meeting. One endured in silence, the other became angry and irate. When the one who had become irate saw that he had transgressed, he went to the monk who had stayed silent, wishing to confess. <span class="supplied">However,</span> the monk who had endured in silence did not accept the confession. When this transpired, there ensued a noisy discussion among all the monks. The <i>Tathāgata</i> was at that time abiding in meditation, and heard <span class="supplied">the clamor</span> clearly with his <i>deva</i>-like hearing, which surpasses human hearing and can discern sounds from far away. He rose from his seat, went to the monks, and sat on the seat prepared in front of them.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-37.4"></a>The Buddha said to the monks: “This morning I took my robes and begging bowl and entered the town to beg for food. ( … and so on … ) went into the forest, and sitting silently, I heard monks shouting and clamoring. What is the matter?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-37.5"></a>Then the monks told the Buddha: “World-honored One, in the Jeta Vihāra there are two monks who got into an argument during a meeting. One monk endured in silence, the other monk became irate and said a lot. The irate monk knew that he had transgressed and went <span class="supplied">to offer an</span> honest confession. The monk that had endured silently did not accept the other’s confession, so it became a public issue and everybody started shouting.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-37.6"></a>The Buddha told the monks: “Why be so stupid and not accept someone’s confession? Monks, know that in ancient days Sakka Devānaṃ Inda, while in the Sudhamma Hall among the gods spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-37.7"></a>“It is like taking a vessel made from a gourd /<br>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-37.8"></a>The angry mind is like this; /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>it turns on itself and burns one’s wholesome roots.<br>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-37.10"></a>Deeply respecting others’ wish to avoid such topics, /<br>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-38.2"></a>At that time the World-honored One told the monks: “A long time ago Sakka Devānaṃ Inda, leader of the gods, was about to do battle with the <i>asura</i>s. At that time Sakka Devānaṃ Inda said to Vepacitti, king of the <i>asura</i>s: “We should not lead our armies to harm each other, but instead should debate, and thus decide who wins and who loses.” Vepacitti said to Sakka Devānaṃ Inda: “Kosiya, if we were to debate, who would determine the winner and the loser?” Sakka Devānaṃ Inda said: “In both our armies there are people who are intelligent, of wise judgment, able to tell good from bad, and to decide who will be the winner and who the loser.” Vepacitti said: “You speak first, Sakka!” <span class="supplied">But</span> Sakka answered: “My turn will come. You are the older <i>deva</i>. You speak first.” And Vepacitti spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-38.3"></a>“If I were to tolerate transgressions /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>the foolish would say of my patient manner:<br>
‘His patience is born of fear’ /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>and deem themselves superior.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In reply Sakka Devānaṃ Inda spoke this verse:</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-38.4"></a>“Though the other might call it fear /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>and <span class="supplied">think</span> he has gained the upper hand,<br>
precious treasures and all benefits /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span><span class="supplied">are for those</span> invincible ones who are patient when insulted.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Vepacitti spoke another verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-38.5"></a>“The foolish have no wisdom /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>they have to be restrained.<br>

The knife and cudgel are necessary /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>to reign in fools.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sakka Devānaṃ Inda answered with this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-38.6"></a>“I believe that for restraining the foolish /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>silent patience is the best.<br>

</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-38.9"></a>The wise among the gods and the <i>asura</i>s debated this thoroughly, weighing up who had won and who had lost. <span class="supplied">They agreed</span> that the <span class="supplied">king of the</span> <i>asura</i>s had spoken in favor of strife and battle, while Sakka Devānaṃ Inda <span class="supplied">had spoken for</span> ending quarrels, his mind not favoring angry contest. Thus, the <i>asura</i> <span class="supplied">king</span> lost and Sakka won.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-38.10"></a>The Buddha told the monks: “Sakka Devānaṃ Inda, who rules freely in <span class="supplied">the Tāvatiṃsa</span> heaven, has during the long night <span class="supplied">of <i>saṃsāra</i></span> patiently suffered insults, now extols the way of patience.

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-39.3"></a>At that time, the gods won, and they bound Vepacitti with five bonds and brought him to their palace. When Vepacitti saw Sakka, he became angry and insulted him, using extremely foul language. When Sakka heard these insults, he stayed silent, did not react. His charioteer Mātali addressed him with a verse:</p>

<p>Again the charioteer said:</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-39.9"></a>What the foolish call strength /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>is really lack of strength.<br>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-39.10"></a>If I can find the courage in me /<br>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-39.20"></a>The Buddha told the monks: “If Sakka in the heaven of the thirty-three, freely exercising his rulership, can practice and praise patience, how much more should you, monks, who have disfigured yourselves <span class="supplied">by shaving off your hair</span> and entered the teaching, how much more should you practice and praise patience!

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-43.2"></a>At that time the World-honored One said to the monks: “Once the <i>asura</i>s were gathering the four <span class="supplied">kinds of</span> armies: elephants, cavalry, chariots and infantry, all well equipped with arms.

At that time Sakka heard that the <i>asura</i>s had equipped the four armies and he told the Suvīra Devaputta: ‘I hear the <i>asura</i>s have equipped the four armies. You too now equip the four armies, march and meet them in battle!’ Suvīra answered: ‘Very well!’ Having said that, he dawdled around, had some fun, and forgot about it. When Sakka heard that the <i>asura</i>s had left their city, he ordered Suvīra again: ‘The <i>asura</i>s have left their city already. You should array the four armies and march to meet them in battle.’ Suvīra said: ‘Very well, Kosiya.’ But still Suvīra was having fun and did not prepare for battle. When the four armies of the <i>asura</i>s, in splendid formation, had arrived at Mount Sumeru and were preparing to approach <span class="supplied">the city of gods</span>, Sakka said again: ‘I hear the <i>asura</i>s are approaching.

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-44.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-44.2"></a>At that time the World-honoured One said to the monks: “Long ago in a far-away place, some sages (<i>ṛṣi</i>s) lived in the forest. Near that spot the <i>deva</i>s and <i>asura</i>s were doing battle. At that time Vepacitti, the king of the <i>asura</i>s, came to their place adorned with the five <span class="supplied">regal</span> insignia. He wore his crown and held his bejewelled chowrie, a parasol was held above him; he wore his sword at his side and high boots inlaid with gems. He did not come through the door, but entered through the wall. Moreover, he did not speak with the sages, did not exchange pleasantries, but instead left again through the wall. Then one of the sages said: ‘This Vepacitti has no respect. Leaving through the wall like this without even exchanging pleasantries with us sages!’ Another sage said: ‘If the <i>asura</i>s would show some respect and exchange pleasantries, they might defeat the <i>deva</i>s. Too bad they don’t.’ Another sage asked: ‘Who was that?’ Another said <span class="supplied">in reply</span>: ‘That was Vepacitti, the king of the <i>asura</i>s.’ Another sage <span class="supplied">added</span>: ‘The <i>asura</i>s are by nature of shallow knowledge and vision, they are uneducated, without respect, like farmers. Surely the <i>deva</i>s will win and the <i>asura</i>s lose.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-44.3"></a>At that time Sakka came to the place of the Sages. He took off the five insignia of a <i>deva</i> king, entered through the gate, greeted the sages, looked <span class="supplied">politely</span> around, and spoke to the sages: ‘Are all of you in peace here, without trouble?’ Having thus inquired he left again through the gate. There a sage asked: ‘Who was that? Inquiring after our health, looking <span class="supplied">politely</span> around, leaving again … Very educated, of pleasant appearance!’ Another sage answered: ‘That was Sakka.’ Still another said: ‘The <i>deva</i>s know well when to pay respects, their behavior is appropriate. Certainly the <i>deva</i>s will win and the <i>asura</i>s lose.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-44.4"></a>When Vepacitti heard that the sages were praising the <i>deva</i>s and severely criticizing the <i>asura</i>s he became very angry. When the sages heard this, they went to the <i>asura</i>s and said: ‘We hear you are angry.’ Then they spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-44.5"></a>“We therefore came ourselves /<br>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-44.7"></a>“Of his own actions /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>a man gets the fruits.<br>
Acting in a wholesome way, one obtains wholesome <span class="supplied">fruits</span> /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>acting in an unwholesome way, unwholesome will be the fruits<br>
It is like planting a seed: /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>one receives fruit according to its kind.<br>
<span class="supplied">If</span> you plant a bitter seed now /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>that is what you will certainly get later.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-44.8"></a>We asked for freedom from fear /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>but instead you give us terror.<br>
From this day on /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>your fear will have no end.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-44.9"></a>Having said this to the <i>asura</i>’s face the sages rose into the air and vanished. During that night Vepacitti dreamed he met Sakka in battle, <span class="supplied">woke up</span> and felt great fear. This happened a second time. When it happened a third time, Sakka and his armies did indeed come to fight; Vepacitti met them in battle. The <i>asura</i>s were defeated and, pursued by Sakka, they retreated to their <i>asura</i> palace.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-44.10"></a>Having gained victory in various battles, Sakka went to where the sages dwelt. They took seats on opposite sides, the sages to the east, Sakka to the west. At that time there was an easterly wind and the sages addressed Sakka in verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-44.11"></a>“We have left home long ago, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>our armpits stink.<br>
The wind is blowing in your direction /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>go and sit to the south!<br>
Such foul smells /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>the <i>deva</i>s do not enjoy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sakka replied with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-44.12"></a>“Gathering all kinds of flowers, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>weaving them into wreaths,<br>

<span class="indent">​</span>one cannot tire of these!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-44.13"></a>You sages have left the household life /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>your scent is like that of flower wreaths.<br>
We bow to receive it, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>experiencing no distaste.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-44.14"></a>The Buddha said to the monks: “Sakka, who is king of the <i>deva</i>s, always pays respect to those who have left the household life. How much more should you, monks, who out of faith have left the household life, pay deep respect <span class="supplied">to all renunciants</span>.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-44.15"></a>When the Buddha had finished, the monks, having listened to what he had said, were happy and remembered it well.</p>

For this reason one should do good, get rid of all evil behavior, and keep the precepts.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-46.3"></a>Again on the fourteenth day of every fortnight the four guardian kings send out their sons to walk the earth; and on the fifteenth day of every fortnight the four guardian kings themselves walk the earth to observe in the same way.</p>

The gods say: ‘The host of <i>deva</i>s will decrease, and the <span class="supplied">host of</span> <i>asura</i>s will grow.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-46.5"></a>If, however, there are human beings in the world who always practice filial piety, make offerings to renunciants and <i>brāhmaṇa</i>s, and so on …, and many who keep the precepts, then the four guardian kings go up and report this to Sakka. Then the <i>deva</i>s are very much delighted and all say: ‘The human beings in the world are acting in a wholesome way. They are indeed wise and good and doing what they should do.

At that time Sakka Devānaṃ Inda went to him.

If it is possible, I will teach you.’ And the <i>asura</i> king asked the <i>asura</i>s. At that time an <i>asura</i>, who had mastered the art of deception, said: ‘Sakka’s behaviour has always been upright and virtuous, without deception. You tell him this: “If you learn the <i>asura</i>’s art of deception, you will fall into the Raurava Hell.” He then might say: “I am not going to learn this art from the <i>asura</i>s.

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-47.3"></a>Accepting this advice the <i>asura</i> king spoke this verse to Sakka:</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-47.5"></a>When Sakka heard this he said: ‘Enough! Enough! I do not need the art of deception!’ and he promptly said: ‘May your illness cease! May you rest without pain!’”</p>

Upon the breaking up of his body, after his death, he was reborn in Tāvatiṃsa, the most wonderful of all places, as the karmic result of these four things. As anewborn <i>deva</i> he was endowed with three superior things. First, he was of superior beauty. Second, he was of superior glory. Third, he was endowed with superior life-span. When the <span class="supplied">other</span> <i>deva</i>s saw this, they all admired him. They went to Sakka and said to him: “There is a newborn <i>deva</i>, who is superior to us other <i>deva</i>s in three ways.” Sakka said: “I saw this newborn <i>deva</i> <span class="supplied">in his former existence</span>. Formally, as a human being, he was poor and deprived, extremely wretched. <span class="supplied">However,</span> he straightforwardly held faith in the three jewels, kept the precepts purely, and even made some small donations.

<p>Then Sakka spoke this verse:</p>

<h1>Non-Buddhist teachers</h1>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-52.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Gijjhakūṭa mountains. At that time there were ninety-six non-Buddhist groups, each praying and making offerings to someone. There were, for instance, donors who had faith in some non-Buddhist wanderer and those said: “One should first make offerings to our teacher the wanderer!” If they had faith in some non-Buddhist wandering ascetic they said: “First one should make offerings to our teacher the wandering ascetic!” If they had faith in the non-Buddhist teacher Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta they all said: “First give our teacher Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta a big offering, after that give to the others!” If they had faith in some non-Buddhist called a fire-worshiper they said: “One should make offerings to our teacher the fire-worshiper!” If they had faith in some non-Buddhist elder follower of the <i>Veda</i>s they said: “One should first make offerings to our teacher the elder follower of the <i>Vedas</i>!” If they had faith in some renowned non-Buddhist follower of the <i>Veda</i>s they said: “Make offerings to our teacher the renowned follower of the Vedas!” If they had faith in the Buddha, they said: “One should first make offerings to our teacher the <i>Tathāgata</i> and the community of monks!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-52.2"></a>Sakka Devānaṃ Inda thought: “Extremely heretical views have arisen among the people of Rājagaha. Holding heretical views, while the Buddha and the <i>Saṅgha</i> exist in the world, is unwholesome.” With that, Sakka quickly transformed himself into an elder <i>brāhmaṇa</i>, of upright appearance, riding on a white chariot pulled by white horses. Surrounded to left and right by young men, he went to the temple district and passed right through it <span class="supplied">without stopping</span>. All the people in Rājagaha thought: “Where will this elder <i>brāhmaṇa</i> go first? Let’s follow him!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-52.3"></a>Then Sakka, knowing what they were thinking, turned his chariot to the south and went to Gijjhakūṭa. Arriving at the place where the chariots had to stop, he stopped among them, got down, entered the precinct, and approached the Buddha. Having paid homage at the Buddha’s feet and sat to one side, Sakka spoke in verse:</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-52.7"></a>Then the World-honored One, there on Gijjhakūṭa, expounded to Sakka what is most worthy of offerings, answering him in verse:</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-52.12"></a>Burning things <span class="supplied">in a fire sacrifice</span> and praying to the gods /<br>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-52.13"></a>This is called ‘well sacrificed.’ /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>Sakka, you should know,<br>
to give to what is called a worthy ‘field of merit,’ /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>a person within the <i>Saṅgha</i>,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-52.14"></a>later one will certainly attain great fruits. /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>This is said at the right time,<br>
it is said by the Buddha. /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>The Buddha of countless merits</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-52.15"></a>has praised the <i>Saṅgha</i> in hundreds of verses. /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>As the supreme <span class="supplied">recipient</span> of offerings,<br>
Nothing surpasses the <i>Saṅgha</i> as a field of merit. /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>When people plant a small seed of goodness</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-52.16"></a>they reap rewards beyond measure. /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>A good person, therefore,<br>
should make offerings to the <i>Saṅgha</i>. /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>Those who always uphold the <i>Dhamma</i></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-52.17"></a>are called the <i>Saṅgha</i>. /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>Just as in the great ocean<br>
there are many precious jewels, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>so in the ocean of the <i>Saṅgha</i></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-52.18"></a>there are many precious jewels of merit. /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>To offer to the <i>Saṅgha</i> jewel<br>
is to be a worthy person, /<br>

such a person is called /<br>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-52.22"></a>Once one’s faith is pure /<br>

</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-52.23"></a>When Sakka heard these verses, he leaped up in joy, vanished from his seat and returned to his heavenly palace. Not long after Sakka had returned to his palace, the householders and <i>brāhmaṇa</i>s of Rājagaha too rose from their seats, bared their right shoulders, knelt, and with palms together addressed the Buddha: “May the World-honored One and the community of monks accept a large alms-giving from us tomorrow morning. We happily invite you!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-52.24"></a>The <i>Tathāgata</i> consented silently. When the householders and <i>brāhmaṇa</i>s of Rājagaha understood that the Buddha had consented silently, they asked to leave, paid homage at the Buddha’s feet and returned to their homes. Having returned to their homes, each prepared fragrant and precious drinks and foods, cleanly arranged. Having done so, in the morning they prepared seats, readied clean water and sent a messenger to Gijjhakūṭa to tell the Buddha: “The alms-giving is ready.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-52.25"></a>At that time the <i>Tathāgata</i> took his robe and begging bowl and accompanied by a multitude of monks, walking in front of them went to the town where the alms-giving was to take place. Having arrived, he took his prepared seat in front of the monks. The people of the city spread seats for the monks to sit on. When the householders saw that everybody was seated they brought clean water <span class="supplied">for hand-washing</span>. The householders and <i>brāhmaṇa</i>s served the fragrant, delicious food and drink with their own hands. All the people urged <span class="supplied">their guests</span> to eat and try everything. When the World-honored One saw that the monks had finished their meal, he put his bowl away and gave it to Ānanda <span class="supplied">to clean</span>. Thereupon the people got up and arranged their seats in front of the Buddha. They earnestly paid their respects and asked to hear the <i>Dhamma</i>. The Buddha lauded what they had offered and spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-52.26"></a>“Among Brahmanical texts, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>those on the fire-sacrifice are the best.<br>
Among texts of non-Buddhists, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>the Sāvitrī is the best.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-52.27"></a>Among people of the world, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>the king is the highest leader.<br>
Among the hundred streams and many rivers, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>the great ocean is deemed the best.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-52.28"></a>Among stars, stellar houses, and constellations, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>moonlight is deemed the best.<br>
Among lights, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>sunlight is the best.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-52.29"></a>Above, below, and in the four directions, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>in the realms of gods and human beings,<br>
Among the host of noble ones /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>the Buddha is the most worthy of veneration.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-52.30"></a>After the Buddha had in various ways taught the <i>Dhamma</i> to the people of Rājagaha, enlightened and instructed them, benefited and pleased them, the people leaped up <span class="supplied">happily</span> from their seats and went back.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-52.31"></a>When the Buddha had finished speaking, the monks, having heard what the Buddha had said, were happy and remembered it well.</p>
