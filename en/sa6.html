<p><a class="sc" id="sa6.2"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the Blessed One said to the monks:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa6.3"></a>“Not understanding form, not having knowledge regarding it, not being free from desire and lust for it, one will not liberate the mind and will be unable to go beyond the dread of birth, old age, disease and death. In the same way not understanding feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, not having knowledge regarding it, not being free from desire and lust for it, one will not liberate the mind and will be unable to go beyond the dread of birth, old age, disease and death.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa6.4"></a>“Monks, understanding form, having knowledge regarding it, being free from desire and lust for it, one will liberate the mind and will be able to go beyond the dread of birth, old age, disease and death. In the same way understanding feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, having knowledge regarding it, being free from desire and lust for it, one will liberate the mind and will be able to go beyond the dread of birth, old age, disease and death.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa6.5"></a>Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
