<h1 class="supplied">Discourse on Being Learned</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa25.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then a certain monk approached the Buddha, paid homage to the Buddha and withdrew to stand at one side.<a class="t" id="t5c"></a> He said to the Buddha: “As the Blessed One has spoken about being learned how does one <span class="supplied">become</span> learned?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa25.2"></a>The Buddha said to the monk: “It is well, it is well. You are now asking me the meaning of being learned. Is it like this?” The monk said to the Buddha: “Indeed, Blessed One.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa25.3"></a>The Buddha said to the monk: “Listen and pay careful attention to what I will tell you. Monk, you should know that hearing that whereby disenchantment with form arises, whereby one is free from desire for it, whereby there is cessation and a state of peace, this is reckoned being learned. In the same way hearing that whereby disenchantment with feeling … perception … formations … consciousness arises, whereby one is free from desire for it, whereby there is cessation and a state of peace, this is reckoned being learned. Monk, this is reckoned what the Tathāgata declares to be learned.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa25.4"></a>Then that monk, hearing what the Buddha had said, was thrilled with delight, paid homage and left.</p>
