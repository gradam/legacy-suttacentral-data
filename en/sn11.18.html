<h3>Connected Discourses with Sakka</h3>
<h1>18. The Worship of Householders (or Sakka’s Worship (1))</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthı̄. There the Blessed One said this: “Bhikkhus, once in the past Sakka, lord of the devas, addressed his charioteer Matali thus: ‘Harness the chariot with its team of a thousand thoroughbreds, friend Matali. Let us go to the park grounds to see the beautiful scenery.’ - ‘Yes, your lordship,’ Matali the charioteer replied. Then he harnessed the chariot with its team of a thousand thoroughbreds and announced to Sakka, lord of the devas: ‘The chariot has been harnessed, dear sir. You may come at your own convenience.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Then, bhikkhus, Sakka, lord of the devas, descending from the Vejayanta Palace, raised his joined hands in reverential salutation, and worshipped the different quarters. Then Matali the charioteer addressed Sakka in verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a> “‘These all humbly worship you—<br>
Those versed in the Triple Veda,<br>
All the khattiyas reigning on earth,<br>
The Four Great Kings and the glorious Thirty—<br>
So who, O Sakka, is that spirit<br>
To whom you bow in worship?’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="add">Sakka:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a> “‘These all humbly worship me—<br>
Those versed in the Triple Veda,<br>
All the khattiyas reigning on earth,<br>
The Four Great Kings and the glorious Thirty—</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a> But I worship those endowed with virtue,<br>
Those long trained in concentration,<br>
Those who have properly gone forth<br>
With the holy life their destination.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a> “‘I worship as well, O Matali,<br>
Those householders making merit,<br>
The lay followers possessed of virtue<br>
Who righteously maintain a wife.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="add">Matali:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a> “‘Those whom you worship, my lord Sakka,<br>
Are indeed the best in the world.<br>
I too will worship them—<br>
Those whom you worship, Vasava.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="add">The Blessed One:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a> “Having given this explanation,<br>
Having worshipped the different quarters,<br>
The deva-king Maghava, Suja’s husband,<br>
The chief, climbed into his chariot.” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.i.235"></a></p>
