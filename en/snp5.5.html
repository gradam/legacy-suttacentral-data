Because of clinging to a basis countless kinds<br>
of suffering originate for whoever is in the world.</p>

seeing the birth and origin of suffering.”<br></p>

How do the wise ones cross over the flood<br>
of birth, old age, grief, and lamentation?<br>
Please explain this to me, O sage,<br>
for this Teaching has been understood by you.”</p>

without hindrance or doubt, he has crossed beyond.</p>
