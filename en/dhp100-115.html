<h2>Sahassavagga</h2>
<h1>The Thousands</h1>
</hgroup>
<p><a class="sc">100</a>Better than a thousand useless words is one useful word, hearing which one attains peace.</p>
<p><a class="sc">101</a>Better than a thousand useless verses is one useful verse, hearing which one attains peace.</p>
<p><a class="sc">102</a>Better than reciting a hundred meaningless verses is the reciting of one verse of Dhamma, hearing which one attains peace.</p>
<p><a class="sc">103</a>Though one may conquer a thousand times a thousand men in battle, yet he indeed is the noblest victor who conquers himself.</p>
<p><a class="sc"></a>104–105 Self-conquest is far better than the conquest of others. Not even a god, an angel, Mara or Brahma can turn into defeat the victory of a person who is self-subdued and ever restrained in conduct.</p>
<p><a class="sc">106</a>Though month after month for a hundred years one should offer sacrifices by the thousands, yet if only for a moment one should worship those of perfected minds that honor is indeed better than a century of sacrifice.</p>
<p><a class="sc">107</a>Though for a hundred years one should tend the sacrificial fire in the forest, yet if only for a moment one should worship those of perfected minds, that worship is indeed better than a century of sacrifice.</p>
<p><a class="sc">108</a>Whatever gifts and oblations one seeking merit might offer in this world for a whole year, all that is not worth one fourth of the merit gained by revering the Upright Ones, which is truly excellent.</p>
<p><a class="sc">109</a>To one ever eager to revere and serve the elders, these four blessing accrue: long life and beauty, happiness and power.</p>
<p><a class="sc">110</a>Better it is to live one day virtuous and meditative than to live a hundred years immoral and uncontrolled.</p>
<p><a class="sc">111</a>Better it is to live one day wise and meditative than to live a hundred years foolish and uncontrolled.</p>
<p><a class="sc">112</a>Better it is to live one day strenuous and resolute than to live a hundred years sluggish and dissipated.</p>
<p><a class="sc">113</a>Better it is to live one day seeing the rise and fall of things than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the rise and fall of things.</p>
<p><a class="sc">114</a>Better it is to live one day seeing the Deathless than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the Deathless.</p>
<p><a class="sc">115</a>Better it is to live one day seeing the Supreme Truth than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the Supreme Truth.</p>
