<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa16.2"></a>“One who surrenders to the underlying tendencies and surrenders to the underlying tendency at death is reckoned <span class="supplied">accordingly</span>. One who does not surrender to the underlying tendencies and does not surrender to the underlying tendency at death is not reckoned <span class="supplied">accordingly</span>”</p>

One who surrenders to the underlying tendencies and surrenders to the underlying tendency at death is reckoned <span class="supplied">accordingly</span>.</p>

One who does not surrender to the underlying tendencies and does not surrender to the underlying tendency at death is not reckoned <span class="supplied">accordingly</span>. Blessed One, in this way I understand in full the meaning of the teaching herein spoken in brief.”</p>
