<h1>The Discourse about Kassapa</h1>
</hgroup>

<p><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Rājagaha, in Bamboo Wood, at the Squirrels' Feeding Place. Then at that time venerable Mahākassapa was dwelling in the Pepper Cave, and was sitting in one cross-legged posture for seven days, having attained a certain concentration.</p>

<p>Then venerable Mahākassapa, with the passing of those seven days arose from that concentration. Then it occured to venerable Mahākassapa after arising from that concentration: “Well now, I should enter Rājagaha for alms.”</p>

<p>Then at that time five hundred devatās were ready and eager to offer almsfood to venerable Mahākassapa. But venerable Mahākassapa, after refusing those five hundred devatās, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.</p>

<p>Then at that time the lord of the devas Sakka, having a desire to give almsfood to venerable Mahākassapa, having created the appearance of a weaver <span class="supplied">for himself</span>, was weaving thread while the Asura maiden Sujā was filling the shuttle. Then venerable Mahākassapa, while walking systematically for alms in Rājagaha, went to the residence of the lord of the devas Sakka.</p>

<p>The lord of the devas Sakka saw venerable Mahākassapa coming while still far away. After seeing <span class="supplied">him</span>, leaving the house, going to meet <span class="supplied">him</span>, taking the bowl from his hand, entering the house, taking up the rice from the pot, and filling the bowl, he gave it to venerable Mahākassapa, and that almsfood had many sauces, many curries, many sauces and tasty curries.</p>

<p>Then this occured to venerable Mahākassapa: “Now who is this being, who has such power and majesty?”</p>

<p>Then it occured to venerable Mahākassapa: “This is the lord of the devas Sakka.”</p>

<p>Having understood it was so, he said this to the lord of the devas Sakka: “This is your doing, Kosiya, you must not do such a thing again.”</p>

<p>“We also have a need for merit, reverend Kassapa, we also have a duty to make merit.”</p>

<p>Then the lord of the devas Sakka after worshipping and circumambulating venerable Mahākassapa, after going up into the sky, while in the air, in the firmament, three times uttered an exalted utterance:</p>

<p>“Ah giving! The best gift is well established on Kassapa, Ah giving! The best gift is well established on Kassapa.”</p>

<p>The Gracious One heard with his divine ear-element, which is purified, and surpasses that of <span class="supplied">normal</span> men, the lord of the devas Sakka, after going up into the sky, while in the air, in the firmament, three times uttering an exalted utterance:</p>

<p>“Ah giving! The best gift is well established on Kassapa, Ah giving! The best gift is well established on Kassapa.”</p>

<p>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="verse">
<p>“The devas envy the alms-gathering monk, <br>
Self-supporting, not nourishing another, <br>
Such a one, a peaceful one, one who is always mindful.”</p>

</blockquote>
