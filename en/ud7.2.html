<h1>The Second Discourse about Bhaddiya</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then at that time venerable Sāriputta, thinking that venerable Bhaddiya the dwarf was still a trainee, was instructing, rousing, enthusing, and cheering him in abundant and countless ways with a Dhamma talk. The Gracious One saw venerable Sāriputta, <span class="supplied">who was</span> thinking that venerable Bhaddiya the dwarf was still a trainee, instructing, rousing, enthusing, and cheering him in abundant and countless ways with a Dhamma talk.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“He has cut off the cycle, gone to the desireless,<br>
Dried up, the stream no longer flows,<br>
Cut off, the cycle no longer rolls on,<br>
Just this is the end of suffering.”</p>
</blockquote>
