<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ud3.5.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta's Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Then at that time venerable Mahāmoggallāna was sitting not far away from the Gracious One, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, and was attending well to mindfulness related to his own body.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ud3.5.2"></a>The Gracious One saw venerable Mahāmoggallāna was sitting not far away, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, and was attending well to mindfulness related to his own body. Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="verse">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ud3.5.3"></a>“Attending to mindfulness related to the body,<br>
Restrained in regard to the six spheres of contact,<br>
The monk who is continually concentrated,<br>
Can know nibbāna for himself.”</p>
