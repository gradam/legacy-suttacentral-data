<p>“One should keep close company with a spiritual friend (<i lang="pi">kalyāṇamitra</i>) lest one should fall into the habit of doing evil and be convinced of <span class="insertion">the harmlessness of</span> evil action. Thus, O bhikṣus, by keeping close contact with a spiritual friend one is finally convinced of one’s progress (<i lang="pi">bhūyobhāva</i>) and growth (<i lang="pi">vṛddhi</i>) <span class="insertion">in regard to the following</span>: considerable growth in learning (<i lang="pi">śruta</i>), generosity (<i lang="pi">dāna</i>), insight-knowledge (<i lang="pi">jñāna</i>) and wisdom (<i lang="pi">prajñā</i>). If a bhikṣu keeps close company with a spiritual friend, he will not fall into the habit of doing evil. But if he keeps company with a bad friend (<i lang="pi">pāpamitra</i>), he will lose trust (<i lang="pi">śraddhā</i>), be wanting in moral training, in learning, insight-knowledge and wisdom.”</p>
<p>“For this reason, O bhikṣus, you should keep close company with a spiritual friend and not with a bad friend. Thus, O bhikṣus you should train.” </p>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the bhikṣus<a class="t" id="tT2_597a"></a> were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
