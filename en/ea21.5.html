</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.2"></a>Then the bhiksu Kokālika went to where the Exalted One was. He bowed down his head at <span class="supplied">the Exalted One’s</span> feet and sat down at one side.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.3"></a>Then that bhikṣu said to the Exalted One: “The intentions (<i lang="pi">samudācāra</i>) of the bhikṣus Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana are very wicked; there are many <span class="supplied">instances of</span> misconduct (<i lang="pi">duścarita</i>) <span class="supplied">on their part</span>.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.4"></a>“Do not say so,” demanded the Exalted One, “you whose heart takes delight in the Tathāgata, <span class="supplied">listen to me</span>: Śāriputra’s and Maudgalyāyana’s conduct is absolutely virtuous (<i lang="pi">ekāntakuśala</i>) and not at all unvirtuous.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.5"></a>Now the bhiksu Kokālika said to the Exalted One a second and a third time: “What the Tathāgata says is true and not false (<i lang="pi">abhūta</i>). However, the intentions of the bhikṣus Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana are very wicked; they have no roots of merit (<i lang="pi">kuśalamūla</i>).”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.6"></a>“You are a fool (<i lang="pi">bāla</i>),” replied the Exalted One, “you do not, alas, trust what the Tathāgata says. By claiming (<i lang="pi">nir-</i> √<i lang="pi">vac</i>) that the bhikṣus Śāriputra and Maudgalyayana are very wicked this is now <span class="supplied">such an instance of</span> misconduct on your part that before long you will face the consequence <span class="supplied">for it</span>.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.7"></a>Then that bhiksu rose from his seat and his body became covered with terrible abscesses: <span class="supplied">first</span> in size of sesame seeds, <span class="supplied">then</span> they turned pea-sized, gradually <i lang="pi">āmalaka</i>-size, then even walnut size and <span class="supplied">finally</span> <i lang="pi">añjali</i>-size. Pus and blood gushed <span class="supplied">from the abscesses, that bhikṣu’s</span> body broke up, his life came to an end and he was reborn in the Lotus Hell (<i lang="pi">padmaniraya</i>).</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.8"></a>When Venerable Maha-Maudgalyāyana heard that Kokālika’s life had come to an end, he went to where the Exalted One was, bowed his head at <span class="supplied">the latter’s</span> feet and sat down at one side.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.9"></a>Instantly he rose from his seat <span class="supplied">again</span> and asked the Exalted One: “Where was the bhikṣu reborn?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.10"></a>“When his life had come to an end, he was reborn in the Lotus Hell,” replied the Exalted One.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.11"></a>“Now I would like to go to that hell,” said venerable Maudgalyāyana, “in order to instruct that person.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.12"></a>“You need not go to him, Maudgalyāyana,” remarked the Exalted One.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.13"></a>“I <span class="supplied">still</span> would like to go to hell in order to instruct that person,” repeated Maudgalyāyana. Thereafter the Exalted One remained silent and did not reply.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.14"></a>Then, as fast as a strong man bends his arm, Maha-Maudgalyāyana disappeared from Śrāvastī and arrived in the Lotus Hell. Just at that time the bhikṣu Kokālika’s body was all ablaze, and there were a hundred head of cattle ploughing into his tongue. Sitting cross-legged (<i lang="pi">paryaṅkam ābhujya</i>) in the air and snapping his fingers, Maha-Maudgalyāyana signaled <span class="supplied">his arrival</span> to that bhikṣu, and at once the latter, while looking upwards, asked him: “Who are you?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.15"></a>“Kokālika,” Maudgalyāyana answered, “I am a disciple of Śākyamuni Buddha. My personal name is Maudgalyayana, my family name is Kolita.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.16"></a>Having recognized Maudgalyāyana, the bhikṣu spat these malicious words <span class="supplied">at him</span>: “Now I am sunk in this miserable destiny (<i lang="pi">durgati</i>) but, alas, without being spared from your presence.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.17"></a>He had hardly uttered these words when, consequentially, a thousand head of cattle appeared, ploughing into his tongue. When Maudgalyāyana had witnessed that, it saddened him all the more, <span class="supplied">realising</span> that in <span class="supplied">Kokālika</span> there was no change of heart making him repent.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.18"></a>Maudgalyāyana returned to Śrāvastī and went to where the Exalted One was. He bowed down … and stood at one side. Then he reported the whole matter to the Exalted One who replied: “I told you before that it was not necessary to go to see that wicked man.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.19"></a>On this occasion, the Exalted One uttered the following verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.20"></a>“The man was born to have a hatchet in his mouth with<br>
Which he cuts up himself. Through his malicious words<br>
He has rendered both his and my breathing ( <i lang="pi">āśvāsapraśvāsa</i>)<br>
Obnoxious ( <i lang="pi">aprāsādika</i>), <span class="supplied">whereas breathing</span> in and out<br>
Is <span class="supplied">otherwise</span> entirely wholesome.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.21"></a>“Such <span class="supplied">a person</span> is sunk in a miserable destiny.<br>
His action was extremely wicked.<br>
Such a wicked <span class="supplied">action</span> directed against a Tathāgata,<br>
Either of the past or present, <span class="supplied">entails</span> the Gravest <span class="supplied">consequences</span>.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.22"></a>“Thirteen thousand and six <span class="supplied">aeons</span><br>
And <span class="supplied">yet</span> one <span class="supplied">more of staying in</span> the Hell of Hot Ashes (<i lang="pi">bhasmaniraya</i>).<br>
He who commits <span class="supplied">wicked</span> actions by deed or word,<br><span class="supplied">Such as</span> abusing noble persons, will go to that <span class="supplied">hell</span>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.23"></a>Thereupon the Exalted one said to the bhikṣus: “You should train in three things to perfect your conduct. In which three? In virtuous conduct by deed, word and thought. Thus, bhikṣus, you should train.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea21.5.24"></a>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the bhikṣus were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
