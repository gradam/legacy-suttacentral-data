<h2>Nirayavagga</h2>
<h1>Hell</h1>
</hgroup>

<p><a class="sc">306</a>The liar goes to
the state of woe; also he who, having done (wrong), says, "I did
not do it." Men of base actions both, on departing they share the
same destiny in the other world.</p>
<p><a class="sc">307</a>There are many
evil characters and uncontrolled men wearing the saffron robe.
These wicked men will be born in states of woe because of their
evil deeds.</p>
<p><a class="sc">308</a>It would be
better to swallow a red-hot iron ball, blazing like fire, than as
an immoral and uncontrolled monk to eat the alms of the people.</p>
<p><a class="sc">309</a>Four misfortunes
befall the reckless man who consorts with another's wife:
acquisition of demerit, disturbed sleep, ill-repute, and (rebirth
in) states of woe.</p>
<p><a class="sc">310</a>Such a man
acquires demerit and an unhappy birth in the future. Brief is the
pleasure of the frightened man and woman, and the king imposes
heavy punishment. Hence, let no man consort with another's
wife.</p>
<p><a class="sc">311</a>Just as
<i>kusa</i> grass wrongly handled cuts the hand, even so, a
recluse's life wrongly lived drags one to states of woe.</p>
<p><a class="sc">312</a>Any loose act,
any corrupt observance, any life of questionable celibacy — none of
these bear much fruit.</p>
<p><a class="sc">313</a>If anything is to
be done, let one do it with sustained vigor. A lax monastic life
stirs up the dust of passions all the more.</p>
<p><a class="sc">314</a>An evil deed is
better left undone, for such a deed torments one afterwards. But a
good deed is better done, doing which one repents not later.</p>
<p><a class="sc">315</a>Just as a border
city is closely guarded both within and without, even so, guard
yourself. Do not let slip this opportunity (for spiritual growth).
For those who let slip this opportunity grieve indeed when
consigned to hell.</p>
<p><a class="sc">316</a>Those who are
ashamed of what they should not be ashamed of, and are not ashamed
of what they should be ashamed of — upholding false views, they go
to states of woe.</p>
<p><a class="sc">317</a>Those who see
something to fear where there is nothing to fear, and see nothing
to fear where there is something to fear — upholding false views,
they go to states of woe.</p>
<p><a class="sc">318</a>Those who imagine
evil where there is none, and do not see evil where it is —
upholding false views, they go to states of woe.</p>
<p><a class="sc">319</a>Those who discern
the wrong as wrong and the right as right — upholding right views,
they go to realms of bliss.</p>
