<h3>Connected Discourses with Mara</h3>
<h1>5. Mara’s Snare (2)</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Baraṇasi in the Deer Park at Isipatana. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Bhikkhus, I am freed from all snares, both celestial and human. You too, bhikkhus, are freed from all snares, both celestial and human. Wander forth, O bhikkhus, for the welfare of the multitude, for the happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans. Let not two go the same way. Teach, O bhikkhus, the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing. Reveal the perfectly complete and purified holy life. There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are falling away because they do not hear the Dhamma. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.i.106"></a> There will be those who will understand the Dhamma. I too, bhikkhus, will go to Senanigama in Uruvela in order to teach the Dhamma.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Then Mara the Evil One approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a> “You are bound by all the snares<br>
Both celestial and human;<br>
You are bound by the great bondage:<br>
You won’t escape me, ascetic!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="add show">The Blessed One:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a> “I am freed from all the snares<br>
Both celestial and human;<br>
I am freed from the great bondage:<br>
You’re defeated, End-maker!”</p>
</blockquote>
