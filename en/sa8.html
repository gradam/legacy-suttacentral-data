<p><a class="sc" id="sa8.2"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the Blessed One said to the monks:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa8.3"></a>“In the past form was impermanent and in the future it will be [impermanent], what to say of form in the present! A noble disciple who contemplates like this is not concerned with form in the past and does not rejoice in form in the future. Being disenchanted with form in the present, he becomes free from desire and rightly progresses towards cessation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa8.4"></a>“In the same way in the past feeling … perception … formations … consciousness was impermanent and in the future it will be [impermanent], what to say of consciousness in the present! A noble disciple who contemplates like this is not concerned with consciousness in the past and does not rejoice in consciousness in the future. Being disenchanted with consciousness in the present, he becomes free from desire and rightly progresses towards cessation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa8.5"></a>(Just as with impermanence, in the same way also for <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>, emptiness and not-self)</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa8.6"></a>Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said,<a class="t">2a</a> were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
