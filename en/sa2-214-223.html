<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-214.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-214.2"></a>At that time there was a nun called Āḷavikā. Early one morning she took her robes and her begging bowl and entered the town to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she cleaned her bowl, and decided to enter the Andhavana forest <span class="insertion">to meditate</span>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-214.3"></a>At that time King Māra the Bad thought: “Gotama the renunciant is now staying at Sāvatthī in the Andhavana forest. His disciple the nun Āḷavikā entered the town <span class="insertion">Sāvatthī</span> to beg for food. Having finished her meal and cleaned her bowl, she has gathered her seat and wants to enter this forest. I shall disturb her!” Thereupon the Bad One transformed himself into a young man. Standing by the wayside, he asked Āḷavikā: “Where are you going?” The nun answered: “I am going to a secluded place.” On hearing this, the young man spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-214.4"></a>“In all the worlds /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>there is no liberation<br>
You are going to a secluded, quiet place /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>for what?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-214.5"></a>You are still young and pretty; /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>if you won’t enjoy the five sensual pleasures <span class="insertion">now</span>,<br>
One day you will be old and weak; /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>don’t have regrets later.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-214.6"></a>Then the nun thought: “Who is this, who wants to disturb me? What a deceiver! Is he a human or a non-human being?” Having thought this, she entered concentration and, using her insight, she recognized that it was the Bad One who had tried to disturb her. She spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-214.7"></a>“There is liberation in the world; /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>I know this through experience.<br>
You, Bad One, ignorant and shallow /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>do not know its traces.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-214.8"></a>Sensual pleasure is like a sharp halberd, slashing; /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>the aggregates are bandits, running after you knife in hand.<br>
You talk of enjoying the five sensual pleasures /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>but the suffering <span class="insertion">caused by</span> pleasure is to be feared.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-214.9"></a>Sensual pleasure causes sadness and troubles, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>sensual pleasure causes longing.<br>
Sensual pleasure causes a hundredfold suffering, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>sensual pleasure is the root of all suffering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-214.10"></a><span class="insertion">I have</span> cut off all craving, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>the darkness of ignorance is destroyed.<br>
Having reached and witnessed complete cessation, /<br>

</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-214.11"></a>At that time the Bad One thought: “The nun Āḷavikā knows my mind well!” Vexed, dispirited, and ashamed, he returned to his palace.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-221.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-221.2"></a>At that time there was a nun named Cālā. One morning she took her robes and her begging bowl, and entered the town to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she cleaned her bowl, and gathered her seat <span class="insertion">for meditation</span>. She went to the Andhavana forest for the day’s abiding, and sat upright under a tree to meditate. At that time King Māra thought: “The renunciant Gotama is staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park. There is the nun Cālā who in the morning took her robes and her begging bowl and entered the town to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she cleaned her bowl, gathered her seat and has gone into the Andhavana forest for the day’s abiding. <span class="insertion">Now</span> she is sitting under a tree. I shall go there and disturb her!” Having thought thus, he transformed himself into a young man, approached her, and said: “My lady, where do you desire to be reborn?” The nun replied: “As things stand, I will not be reborn anywhere.” At that time the young man spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-221.3"></a>“Once born we are bound to experience joy /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>and the five sensual pleasures.<br>
Who has taught you /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>to say you have no need of further birth?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nun Cālā replied with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-221.4"></a>“Whoever is born must die /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>and is held in bondage by all kinds of suffering.<br>
To cut off all suffering /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>is not to ask for further life.<br>
The venerable sage, the seer /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>has explained this truth:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-221.5"></a>Suffering, the cause for its arising, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>all this is to be left behind<br>
through practicing the eight-fold noble path, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>peacefully we move toward <i>Nirvāṇa</i>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-221.6"></a>The World-honored One has taught me, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>and I rejoice in his teaching.<br>
I have witnessed and realized this teaching /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>and therefore have no joy in birth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-221.7"></a>I have cut off all craving, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>the darkness of ignorance is destroyed.<br>
Having reached complete cessation, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span><span class="insertion">I</span> peacefully dwell in a state of purity.<br>
Therefore understand: /<br>
