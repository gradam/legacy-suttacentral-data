<h1>The Discourse about Revata</h1>
</hgroup>

<p><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta's Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Then at that time venerable Kaṅkhārevata <span class="supplied">Doubting Revata</span> was sitting not far away from the Gracious One, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, reflecting on his own purification through crossing over doubt.</p>

<p>The Gracious One saw venerable Kaṅkhārevata sat not far away, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, reflecting on his own purification through crossing over doubt.</p>

<p>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="verse">
<p>“Whatever doubts there are <span class="supplied">about</span> here or hereafter, <br>
Understandable by oneself, or understandable by another, <br>
The meditators give up all these, <br>
The ardent ones living the spiritual life.”</p>
