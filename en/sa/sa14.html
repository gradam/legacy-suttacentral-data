<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the Blessed One said to the monks:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“In the past I dwelled searching for the gratification in relation to form. I accordingly realized the gratification in relation to form and saw with knowledge and wisdom as it really is the gratification in relation to form. In the same way I dwelled searching for the gratification in relation to feeling … perception … formations … consciousness. I accordingly realized the gratification in relation to feeling … perception … formations … consciousness and saw with knowledge and wisdom as it really is the gratification in relation to consciousness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Monks, I dwelled searching for the danger in relation to form. I accordingly realized the danger in relation to form and saw with knowledge and wisdom as it really is the danger in relation to form. In the same way I dwelled searching for the danger in relation to feeling … perception … formations … consciousness. I accordingly realized the danger in relation to consciousness and saw with knowledge and wisdom as it really is the danger in relation to consciousness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Monks, I dwelled searching for the escape from form. I accordingly realized the escape from form and saw with knowledge and wisdom as it really is the escape from form. In the same way I dwelled searching for the escape from feeling … perception … formations … consciousness. I accordingly realized the escape from feeling … perception … formations … consciousness and saw with knowledge and wisdom as it really is the escape from feeling … perception … formations … consciousness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Monks, [as long as] I had not understood as it really is the gratification in relation to the five aggregates of clinging as gratification, the danger as danger and the escape as escape, among gods, Māra, Brahmā, recluses, brahmins and the assemblies of gods and men I was not liberated, was not released, had not gone beyond, was forever dwelling in [mental] distortion and was unable to declare of myself to have attained supreme and right awakening.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“Monks, because I had understood as it really is the gratification in relation to the five aggregates of clinging as gratification, the danger as danger and the escape as escape, among gods and men, Māra, Brahmā, recluses, brahmins and the assemblies of gods and men I was liberated,<a class="t" id="3a"></a> was released, had gone beyond, was forever not dwelling in [mental] distortion and was able to declare of myself to have attained supreme and right awakening.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
