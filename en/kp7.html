<h1>The Beyond the Walls Discourse</h1>
</hgroup>
<blockquote class="verse">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.kp7.1"></a>They stand beyond the walls,<br>
and at the junctions and crossroads,<br>
they stand at the door-posts,<br>
having come to their <span class="supplied">former</span> homes.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.kp7.2"></a>But when abundant food and drink,<br>
both staple and non-staple, is prepared,<br>
no one remembers these<br>
beings, because of their <span class="supplied">past unwholesome</span> deeds,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.kp7.3"></a>Thus those who are compassionate<br>
give to their <span class="supplied">departed</span> relatives,<br>
at the right time, pure, excellent,<br>
suitable drink and food.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.kp7.4"></a><span class="supplied">thinking</span>: “May this go to our relatives,<br>
may our relatives be happy!”<br>
Those who have gathered,<br>
the departed relatives who have assembled<br>
around the food and drink,<br>
respectfully offer their thanks:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.kp7.5"></a><span class="supplied">saying</span>: “ May our relatives live long!<br>
Those to whom we owe this gain,<br>
for we have been honoured,<br>
those who give are not without reward!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.kp7.6"></a>For in that place there is no ploughing,<br>
and cattle-rearing is not found there,<br>
similarly there is no trading,<br>
or buying and selling of gold.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.kp7.7"></a>The departed in that place who have died, <span class="supplied">have to</span> subsist on gifts.<br>
Just as water that rains on the highlands, flows down to the lowlands,<br>
so too what has been given here<br>
is of benefit to the departed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.kp7.8"></a>Just as rivers that are full<br>
<span class="supplied">flow and</span> fill up the ocean,<br>
so too what has been given here<br>
is of benefit to the departed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.kp7.9"></a><span class="supplied">Thinking</span>: “He gave to me, he worked for me,<br>
he was my relative, my friend, my companion,”<br>
he should give gifts for the departed,<br>
remembering what they have done before.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.kp7.10"></a>For no tears, or grief,<br>
or any other lamentations,<br>
are of any use to the departed,<br>
as long as their relatives continue <span class="supplied">grieving</span> in this way.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.kp7.11"></a>But that gift that has been given,<br>
and well placed in the Sangha,<br>
is of benefit to them for a long time,<br>
immediately it is of benefit.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.kp7.12"></a>This then is the definition of a relative's duties—<br>
<span class="supplied">and by this</span> great honour has been done to the departed,<br>
strength has also been given to the monks,<br>
and no little merit has been produced by you!</p>
