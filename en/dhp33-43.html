<h1>The Mind</h1>
</hgroup>

<p><a class="sc">33</a>Just as a fletcher
straightens an arrow shaft, even so the discerning man straightens
his mind — so fickle and unsteady, so difficult to guard.</p>
<p><a class="sc">34</a>As a fish when
pulled out of water and cast on land throbs and quivers, even so is
this mind agitated. Hence should one abandon the realm of Mara.</p>
<p><a class="sc">35</a>Wonderful, indeed,
it is to subdue the mind, so difficult to subdue, ever swift, and
seizing whatever it desires. A tamed mind brings happiness.</p>
<p><a class="sc">36</a>Let the discerning
man guard the mind, so difficult to detect and extremely subtle,
seizing whatever it desires. A guarded mind brings happiness.</p>
<p><a class="sc">37</a>Dwelling in the cave
(of the heart), the mind, without form, wanders far and alone.
Those who subdue this mind are liberated from the bonds of
Mara.</p>
<p><a class="sc">38</a>Wisdom never becomes
perfect in one whose mind is not steadfast, who knows not the Good
Teaching and whose faith wavers.</p>
<p><a class="sc">39</a>There is no fear for
an awakened one, whose mind is not sodden (by lust) nor afflicted
(by hate), and who has gone beyond both merit and demerit.</p>
<p><a class="sc">40</a>Realizing that this
body is as fragile as a clay pot, and fortifying this mind like a
well-fortified city, fight out Mara with the sword of wisdom. Then,
guarding the conquest, remain unattached.</p>
<p><a class="sc">41</a>Ere long, alas! this
body will lie upon the earth, unheeded and lifeless, like a useless
log.</p>
<p><a class="sc">42</a>Whatever harm an
enemy may do to an enemy, or a hater to a hater, an ill-directed
mind inflicts on oneself a greater harm.</p>
<p><a class="sc">43</a>Neither mother,
father, nor any other relative can do one greater good than one's
own well-directed mind.</p>
