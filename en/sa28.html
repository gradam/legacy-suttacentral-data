<h1 class="supplied">Discourse on Nirvāṇa</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa28.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.<a class="t" id="t6a"></a> At that time a certain monk approached the Buddha, paid homage with his head at the <span class="supplied">Buddha’s</span> feet and withdrew to stand at one side. He said to the Buddha: “As the Blessed One has spoken about attaining Nirvāṇa here and now how does a monk attain Nirvāṇa here and now?”</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa28.3"></a>The Buddha said to the monk: “Listen and pay careful attention to what I will tell you.” The Buddha said to the monk: “Arousing disenchantment for form, being free from desire for it, <span class="supplied">proceeding towards</span> its cessation, without giving rise to the influxes, the mind is rightly liberated. This is reckoned how a monk <span class="supplied">attains</span> Nirvāṇa here and now. In the same way arousing disenchantment for feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, being free from desire for it, <span class="supplied">proceeding towards</span> its cessation, without giving rise to the influxes, the mind is rightly liberated. This is reckoned how a monk <span class="supplied">attains</span> Nirvāṇa here and now.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa28.4"></a>Then that monk, hearing what the Buddha had said, was thrilled with delight, paid homage and left.</p>
