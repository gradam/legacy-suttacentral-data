<h3>Māra Saṃyutta</h3>
<h1>The daughters of Māra</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying in the village of Uruvelā near the river Nerañjarā, under the Bodhi tree. This was not long after he had attained Buddhahood. At that time King Māra had this thought: “The Buddha is staying in the village Uruvelā near the river Nerañjarā, under the Bodhi tree. He has just attained Buddhahood. I should go there and try to mislead him.”</p>
<p>He went to the Buddha and spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.2"></a>“You live alone in the wilderness /<br><span class="indent">​</span>unspeaking, always silent.<br>
Of radiant countenance and with celestial body /<br><span class="indent">​</span>all senses <span class="supplied">perceiving</span> happiness,<br>
like someone who had lost his fortune /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and later regained it.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.3"></a>You are idling your time away in the silence of meditation /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and the enjoyment that comes with it.<br>
Since you have been able to discard public honors /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and do not desire status and profit,<br>
why do you not with others /<br><span class="indent">​</span>form close friendships?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.4"></a>At that time the World-honored One answered with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.5"></a>“For a long time I have attained meditative concentration /<br><span class="indent">​</span>where the mind is always still.<br>
I have defeated your armies of desire /<br><span class="indent">​</span><span class="supplied">and</span> attained the highest fortune.<br>
My senses are always quiet and happy /<br><span class="indent">​</span>In my mind I have attained silent extinction.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.6"></a>Defeating your armies of desire /<br><span class="indent">​</span>practicing the way I feel joy,<br><span class="supplied">I live</span> alone, apart from the hustle and bustle <span class="supplied">of others</span> /<br><span class="indent">​</span>What use have I for close friends?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At that time King Māra spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.7"></a>“Now, since you have attained the true way /<br><span class="indent">​</span>you can rest in <i>Nirvāṇa</i>.<br>
Since you have reached the wonderful <i>Dhamma</i> /<br><span class="indent">​</span>you should keep it forever in your bosom.<br>
Uprightly face and understand it alone; /<br><span class="indent">​</span>why should you teach the manyfolk?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.8"></a>At that time the World-honored One answered with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.9"></a>“Humankind does not belong to you. /<br><span class="indent">​</span>If someone asks me about the teaching that leads to the other shore,<br>
I will correctly explain /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the truth to let them attain extinction.<br>
Stopping their mind without giving up; /<br><span class="indent">​</span>Māra will not overpower them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At that time King Māra spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.10"></a>“It is as if there were a largewhite boulder /<br><span class="indent">​</span>its color like that of fat.<br>
A flock of crows cannot distinguish <span class="supplied">the two</span> /<br><span class="indent">​</span>they perch on it and peck away,<br>
but do not get the taste <span class="supplied">they wanted</span> /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and with bruised beaks take off again into the air.<br>
I myself am like this /<br><span class="indent">​</span>having come in vain, there is nothing more to do.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.11"></a>Then King Māra, having spoken this verse, became depressed and dispirited and felt deep regret. He went to an empty place where he crouched alone and, drawing <span class="supplied">figures</span> on the ground with an arrow, tried to think of a way <span class="supplied">to prevent the Buddha from teaching</span>. Māra had three daughters; the first was called Desire, the second Passion, and the third Pleasure<i>.</i> Māra’s daughters came to his side and addressed their father with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.12"></a>“Father, you are called “Great Lord,” /<br><span class="indent">​</span>why are you so depressed?<br>
We will with the snare of desire /<br><span class="indent">​</span>bind him <span class="supplied">the Buddha</span> as one catches a bird,<br>
and bring him to you, father, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>to make you feel at ease.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>King Māra answered with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.13"></a>“This man is good in cutting off desire /<br><span class="indent">​</span>he is not moved by it.<br>
He has left the world of Māra already /<br><span class="indent">​</span>this is why I am sad.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.14"></a>Then, Māra’s three daughters changed their appearance, becoming extraordinarily beautiful. They went to the Buddha, paid homage to his feet and sat to one side. The three daughters said together with one voice: “We have come to worship you and be at your service.” But the World-honored One <span class="supplied">had already attained</span> the final cutting-off of desires and did not even look at them. They addressed him like this a second and a third time. The Buddha did not look at them. Then, Māra’s three daughters retreated and discussed the matter: “It is in the nature of men that they like different types <span class="supplied">of women</span>. Some like <span class="supplied">their women</span> young, some like them middle-aged and some mature.” Upon <span class="supplied">saying</span> that, each daughter changed into six hundred women, some of them small girls, some teenagers, some of them already married women, and some not yet married, some of them had given birth already and some had not yet given birth. Having thus transformed themselves into a multitude of women, they all went to the Buddha and said to him: “World-honored One! We have come to worship the World-honored One and be at his service. We will serve <span class="supplied">the World-honored One</span> in every way.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.15"></a>The Buddha did not look at them. They addressed him like this a second and a third time. The Buddha did not look at them at all. Then, Māra’s daughters retreated and conferred again: “He must have attained the final cutting-off of desire, the supreme liberation. Otherwise he would have looked at us and become mad, spitting blood. It might even have torn his heart apart. Let us go to him and debate with him in verse.”</p>
<p>Māra’s daughter Desire asked in a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.16"></a>“The body upright, one hand cupped within another, you sit under the tree /<br><span class="indent">​</span>alone in complete solitude, contemplating.<br>
Like someone who has lost a fortune /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and desires to find a great treasure.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.17"></a>In the cities and villages /<br><span class="indent">​</span>your mind is without passion or attachment.<br>
Why is it that among all those people /<br><span class="indent">​</span>you have made no close friends?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.18"></a>At that time the World-honored One answered in a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.19"></a>“I have already attained the great treasure /<br><span class="indent">​</span>attained quiet extinction in the mind.<br>
I have destroyed the host of passion and desire /<br><span class="indent">​</span>am not attached to wonderful forms.<br>
I dwell alone sitting in meditation /<br><span class="indent">​</span>experiencing the ultimate joy.<br>
For this reason /<br><span class="indent">​</span>I do not desire close friends.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Māra’s daughter Passion spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.20"></a>“Dwelling in which state, oh monk, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>have you crossed the five currents <span class="supplied">of sense-pleasures</span>,<br>
as well as the sixth <span class="supplied">i.e. The mind</span> /<br><span class="indent">​</span>in what meditation do you abide?<br>
That you attained the crossing from the shore of great desire /<br><span class="indent">​</span>forever free from the bondage of becoming?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At that time the World-honored One spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.21"></a>“The body has obtained subtle, gentle joy /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the mind has attained good liberation.<br>
The mind abstains from action /<br><span class="indent">​</span>consciousness will never again regress.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.22"></a>Having attained the method of cutting off discursive thought /<br><span class="indent">​</span>having achieved total abandoning of hatred and desire;<br>
if one can abide in this state /<br><span class="indent">​</span><span class="supplied">one</span> can cross the five currents,<br>
and the sixth as well /<br><span class="indent">​</span>If one can sit in meditation like this,<br>
one can cross from the great fetter of desire /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and leave the relentless flow of becoming.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Māra’s daughter Pleasure said in a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.23"></a>“Having cut off the fetter of desire /<br><span class="indent">​</span>having abandoned what most people are attached to,<br>
crossing over the currents of many desires /<br><span class="indent">​</span>crossing from the fatal shore of many desires;<br>
only the wise /<br><span class="indent">​</span>can cross against these difficulties.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.24"></a>At that time the World-honored One spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.25"></a>“By great effort the <i>Tathāgata</i> extracts himself /<br><span class="indent">​</span><span class="supplied">and</span> crosses with the help of the true <i>Dhamma</i>.<br>
Liberated by the <i>Dhamma</i> /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the wise have no reason to be unhappy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.26"></a>The three daughters, their wish unfulfilled, returned to their father. King Māra scolded them by speaking a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.27"></a>“My three daughters, you thought you could destroy him /<br><span class="indent">​</span>with your appearance <span class="supplied">stunning</span> as lightning.<br>
Advancing on the <span class="supplied">one of</span>great energy /<br><span class="indent">​</span><span class="supplied">you were scattered by him</span> like tufts of grass in the wind;</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.28"></a><span class="supplied">You acted as if you could</span> tear down a mountain with your fingernails /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and bite through iron pellets with your teeth;<br>
foolish children <span class="supplied">trying</span> with lotus fibers/ to suspend a great mountain.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.29"></a>The Buddha has already crossed beyond all attachment /<br><span class="indent">​</span>desiring to argue with him<br><span class="supplied">is like wanting to</span> catch the wind with a net /<br><span class="indent">​</span>like wanting to take down the moon from the sky,<br><span class="supplied">or like wanting</span> to scoop the ocean with one’s hands /<br><span class="indent">​</span>in the hope of bailing it dry.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.30"></a>The Buddha has already left all attachment behind; /<br><span class="indent">​</span>desiring to go and argue with him<br><span class="supplied">is like</span> lifting one’s foot to stride over Mount Sumeru /<br><span class="indent">​</span><span class="supplied">or</span> to find solid earth <span class="supplied">to step on</span> in the great ocean.<br>
The Buddha has already abandoned all attachment, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>yet you go and argue with him!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.31.31"></a>King Māra, sad and regretful, vanished and returned to his heavenly palace.</p>
