<h1>16 Exquisiteness</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of exquisiteness. What four? (1) Here, a bhikkhu possesses supreme exquisiteness of form. He does not perceive any other exquisiteness of form more excellent or sublime than that one; he does not yearn for any other exquisiteness of form more excellent or sublime than that one. (2) He possesses supreme exquisiteness of feeling <a class="pts_pn" id="an.ii.18"></a> … (3) … supreme exquisiteness of perception … (4) … supreme exquisiteness of volitional activities. He does not perceive any other exquisiteness of volitional activities more excellent or sublime than that one; he does not yearn for any other exquisiteness of volitional activities more excellent or sublime than that one.</p>
<p>“These are the four kinds of exquisiteness.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Having known the exquisiteness of form,<br>
the origination of feelings,<br>
how perception arises,<br>
and where it disappears;<br>
having known volitional activities<br>
as alien, as suffering, and not as self,<br>
truly that bhikkhu who sees rightly,<br>
peaceful, delights in the peaceful state.<br>
He bears his final body,<br>
having conquered Māra and his mount.<br></p>
