<h1>The Discourse about Kaccāna</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="sc.ud7.8.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then at that time venerable Mahākaccāna was sitting not far away from the Gracious One, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, and was attending well to mindfulness related to his own body. The Gracious One saw venerable Mahākaccāna was sitting not far away, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, and was attending well to mindfulness related to his own body.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ud7.8.2"></a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ud7.8.3"></a>“For he who will be always and continually<br>
Attending to mindfulness relating to the body, <span class="supplied">thinking</span>:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ud7.8.4"></a>“‘There might not be, and there might not be for me,<br>
There will not be, and there will not be for me’,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ud7.8.5"></a>“He who dwells in those gradual <span class="supplied">stages</span> in that place<br>
Can surely, at the right time, cross over clinging.”</p>
