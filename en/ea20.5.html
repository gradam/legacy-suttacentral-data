<p><a class="sc" id="ea20.5.2"></a>“If there is a person who knows <span class="supplied">how</span> to appreciate, <span class="supplied">he or she</span>, never being oblivious of small favours, to say nothing of great acts of kindness (<i lang="pi">upakāra</i>), deserves honour (<i lang="pi">satkārya</i>). Should <span class="supplied">that person</span> be a thousand or one hundred thousand <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> away from here, <span class="supplied">he or she</span> would not after all be far away; <span class="supplied">that person</span> would, was it were, be close to and not estranged from me. For this reason a bhikṣu should know that I always admire and praise someone who knows how to appreciate. Those who do not know how to appreciate great acts of kindness, let alone small favours, are neither close to me nor am I to them. Even if <span class="supplied">an ungrateful person</span> formally wears <span class="supplied">his or her</span> <i lang="pi">saṃghāṭī</i> in my presence, <span class="supplied">he or she</span> is after all far away.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="ea20.5.3"></a>“Therefore, I never say one <span class="supplied">should</span> not appreciate. For this reason, O bhikṣus, you should be mindful of appreciating <span class="supplied">and you should</span> not imitate <span class="supplied">others who do</span> not appreciate. Thus, O bhikṣus, you should train.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="ea20.5.4"></a>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the bhikṣus were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
