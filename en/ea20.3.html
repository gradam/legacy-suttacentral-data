<section class="sutta" id="ea20.3"><article><hgroup><h1>Ekottarāgama 20.3</h1> </hgroup><p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anthāpiṇḍada’s Park. Then the Exalted One was expounding the Teachings surrounded by an audience (<i lang="pi">parṣad</i>) <span class="insertion">consisting of quasi-</span>innumerable (<i lang="pi">asaṃkhyeya</i>) <span class="insertion">persons</span>. </p>
<p>Simultaneously Dharmaruci was alone in his quiet room, reflecting wisely (<i lang="pi">manasi-</i>√<i lang="pi">kṛ</i>). Fully concentrated he entered the absorption<span class="insertion">s and then</span> contemplated the body <span class="insertion">which he had to put up with in his) previous [life</span>: In the middle of the Great Ocean it appeared in the shape of a fish that measured seven hundred <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>. Just as a strong man instantly bends and <span class="insertion">again</span> stretches his arm, he immediately left his quiet room, proceeded to the middle of the Great Ocean and passed by a floating rotten <span class="insertion">fish</span> carcass. </p>
<p>On this occasion Dharmaruci uttered the following verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha"><p>“There are] birth and death for countless aeons and<br> (The duration of one’s] wandering on in 
<i lang="pi">saṃsāra</i> is<br> Incalculable. Everybody is in search of happiness, and<br>
What is obtained is endless misery. Having seen again<br>
One’s former] body, how much less (
<i lang="pi">kiṃ punar</i>) is there<br> The need to create a 
<span class="insertion">new</span> frame (<i lang="pi">gṛha</i>)!</p>
<p>“Once all attachment (<i lang="pi">saṃdhi</i>) has ceased, no further<br> Physical frame will be found (
<i lang="pi">upa‑</i>√<i lang="pi">labh</i>). <span class="insertion">Once</span> the heart<br> Is not involved at all in any action 
<span class="insertion">pertaining to<br> Saṃsāra
</span>, no more clinging (<i lang="pi">abhiṣvaṅga</i>) will be left<br> Behind ‑ to say nothing of this kind of frame; 
<span class="insertion">for</span><br> In Nirvāṇa there is surpassing (
<i lang="pi">adhika</i>) happiness.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scarcely had Venerable Dharmaruci uttered these verses when he disappeared <span class="insertion">at the site of encountering the carcass</span>, shifted to Śrāvastī, to the Jetavanavihāra, and went to where the Exalted One was. On seeing Dharmaruci coming near, the Exalted One said: “Excellent (<i lang="pi">sādhu</i>)—Dharmaruci! Here after a long time.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, Exalted One,” replied Dharmaruci, “here after a long time.” </p>
<p>Now the venerable elders and all the <span class="insertion">other</span> bhikṣus thought to themselves: “This Dharmaruci <span class="insertion">must</span> have permanently been staying near the Exalted One because just now the Exalted One has said, ‘Excellent ‑ Dharmaruci! Here for a long time’.” </p>
<p>Since the Exalted One knew what the bhikṣus were thinking to themselves and wishing to dispel <span class="insertion">any possible</span> uncertainty (<i lang="pi">vicikitsā</i>) <span class="insertion">on their part</span>, he said to them: “It is not because of Dharmaruci that I have made the remark ‘here after a long time <span class="insertion">and not “for a long time”</span>’. <span class="insertion">I have made it</span> for the following reasons:</p>
<p>“In the past, countless aeons ago, the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara had appeared in the world, the Fully and Completely Enlightened One, the Blessed One, perfect in insight-knowledge and good conduct, world-knowing, the supreme Dharma-charioteer, teacher of gods and men, the Buddha, the Bhagavat. <span class="insertion">He</span> was just on his way (<i lang="pi">ā-</i>√<i lang="pi">pad</i>) to the great kingdom <span class="insertion">known as</span> Padma, accompanied by a huge number of bhikṣus, viz. altogether 148,000 persons. </p>
<p>“In those days the four assemblies (<i lang="pi">parṣad</i>) were so numerous that they could neither be counted nor estimated. The country’s king, his ministers, civil servants, people from all social strata <span class="insertion"><i lang="pi">jāti</i></span> came forward <span class="insertion">with their contributions towards a</span> sacrifice (<i lang="pi">yajña</i>) in favour of those who are indispensable.</p>
<p>“At that time there was a brahmin by the name of Yajñada who lived in the foothills (<i lang="pi">antika</i>) of the Himālayas. As far as secret signs, astronomy, and geography were concerned, there was nothing he was not an expert in. He was also a past master at explaining scriptures and at scripts. Another speciality of his was the intonation of a sentence <span class="insertion">consisting of</span> five hundred words and also <span class="insertion">the science of describing</span> the marks of a great being (<i lang="pi">mahāpuruṣalakṣaṇa</i>). He taught five hundred disciples untiringly, day and night, the scriptures <span class="insertion">dealing with</span> Agni, Sūrya, Soma and the <span class="insertion">deities pertaining to other</span> heavenly bodies. </p>
<p>“The brahmin Yajñada had a disciple whose name was Meghadundubhi whose features betrayed a very respectable descent and the colour of whose hair was light reddish-black. The brahmin Meghadundubhi was sagacious and far-seeing and<span class="insertion">, once he had embarked upon something,</span> there was nothing he would not bring to a successful end. Whenever he saw Yajñada, he at once showed him his devotion (<i lang="pi">bhakti</i>) and of all the sacrificial formulae (<i lang="pi">mantra</i>) which a brahmin applied in those days he had perfect command.</p>
<p>“Then the brahmin Meghadundubhi thought to himself: ‘Now all that is required studying I have fully mastered.’ </p>
<p>“And again it occurred to him: ‘He who<span class="insertion">se knowledge</span> surpasses all that is included in the lists of texts dealing with the sciences (<i lang="pi">śiksā</i>) <span class="insertion">relevant to</span> a brahmin’s occupation, is <span class="insertion">my</span> teacher <span class="insertion">whose</span> kindness should be requited. As for myself, all that I had to study I have at present gained mastery of. Now I should requite my teacher’s kindness. However, being poor and without any means enabling <span class="insertion">me</span> to make offerings to my teacher, <span class="insertion">I</span> should go off in all directions in search of the necessary means.’ </p>
<p>“After this <span class="insertion">musing</span> the brahmin Meghadundubhi went to the whereabouts of has teacher and said to him: ‘As for the teachings (<i lang="pi">śāsana</i>) pertaining to the sciences and expertise of a brahmin, <span class="insertion">I</span> have mastered them now. As a matter of fact, he who<span class="insertion">se knowledge</span> surpasses all that is included in the lists of texts dealing with the <span class="insertion">brahminical</span> sciences and expertise, is <span class="insertion">my</span> teacher <span class="insertion">whose</span> kindness should be requited. However, being indigent and lacking gold, silver and <span class="insertion">other</span> precious things enabling <span class="insertion">me</span> to make offerings, now <span class="insertion">I</span> would like to go off in all directions to ask for assets (<i lang="pi">bhoga</i>) enabling <span class="insertion">me</span> to make offerings to my teacher.’</p>
<p>“On <span class="insertion">hearing these words</span> the brahmin Yajñada thought: ‘This brahmin Meghadundubhi who is dear to me is always on my mind. Thinking that <span class="insertion">one day</span> I shall die, I cannot <span class="insertion">bear the very idea of our</span> being separated for ever, let alone <span class="insertion">the idea of his</span> intention to abandon me today and go away. Now how should I proceed in order to keep <span class="insertion">him</span> and make (him) stay?’ </p>
<p>“Then the brahmin Yajñada said to Meghadundubhi: ‘O noble brahmin, for one reason you do not yet know what a brahmin should have studied.’</p>
<p>“In front of his teacher Meghadundubhi asserted: ‘The only thing I am intent on is the acquisition of knowledge (<i lang="pi">āgama</i>). What is it that I have not yet studied?’ </p>
<p>“Instantly Yajñada called to mind a recitation <span class="insertion">consisting of</span> five hundred words (<i lang="pi">pañcaśatavākpāṭha</i>) and told Meghadundubhi: ‘Now there exists a text entitled Pañcaśatavākpāṭha. You may receive it.’ </p>
<p>“‘I hope,’ Meghadundubhi replied, the teacher will be <span class="insertion">so kind</span> as to instruct me; <span class="insertion">I</span> would like to obtain the recitation.’</p>
<p>“O bhikṣus,” <span class="insertion">the Exalted One interrupted his narrative,</span> “you should know that after <span class="insertion">Meghadundubhi’s request</span> Yajñada taught this disciple <span class="insertion">of his</span> the Pañcaśatavākpāṭha. Within just a few days <span class="insertion">the latter</span> became proficient at <span class="insertion">reciting the text until then unknown to him</span>. </p>
<p>“Thereafter the brahmin Yajñada said to his five hundred disciples: ‘This brahmin Meghadundubhi is not really competent <span class="insertion">as far as</span> teaching methods and comprehensive knowledge <span class="insertion">are concerned</span>. This being the case, there is <span class="insertion">someone, however, who</span> has made a name for himself; his name is “He who Surpasses in Prudence”, Nayātikrama. This brahmin Nayātikrama posses a most remarkable talent for astronomy and geography, and there is nothing he is not an expert in. He is a past master at explaining scriptures and at scripts.’ </p>
<p>“When several days had elapsed, the brahmin Nayātikrama went to see his teacher and said: ‘Now <span class="insertion">I</span> am proficient in the methods of teaching the brahminical sciences. He who<span class="insertion">se knowledge</span> surpasses all that is included in the lists of texts treating the <span class="insertion">brahminical</span> sciences, is <span class="insertion">my</span> teacher <span class="insertion">whose</span> kindness, therefore, should be requited. <span class="insertion">But I have</span> to add that <span class="insertion">I</span> am poor, lacking gold, silver and <span class="insertion">other</span> precious things enabling <span class="insertion">me</span> to make offerings to my teacher. Now I would like to go off in all directions in search of assets so as to attain my goal. If only <span class="insertion">I could</span> get permission <span class="insertion">to do so</span>.’ </p>
<p>“‘As you think fit (<i lang="pi">yasya kālaṃ manyasi</i>),’ replied the brahmin Yajñada. The brahmin Nayātikrama bowed down <span class="insertion">his head</span> at his teacher’s feet, stepped backwards and<a class="t" id="tT2_598a"></a> left.</p>
<p>“In those days not far from the <span class="insertion">main</span> town of the great kingdom <span class="insertion">known as</span> Padma a huge number of brahmins had gathered together in one place, viz. 84,000 brahmins, in order to participate in a great sacrifice (<i lang="pi">yajña</i>) and to discuss doctrinal matters. The chief <span class="insertion">of all those brahmins assembled</span> was supposed to be well-versed in the outsiders” (<i lang="pi">tīrthika</i>) chanting and explaining scriptures, knowledgeable about astronomy and geography and a past master at <span class="insertion">explaining</span> extraordinary <span class="insertion">phenomena such as</span> changes in the constellations. </p>
<p>“Everybody was eagerly occupied with amassing five hundred ounces of gold, one golden staff (<i lang="pi">daṇḍa</i>), one golden jug for ablutions and one thousand head of cattle <span class="insertion">to be</span> presented to the foremost teacher <span class="insertion">to be</span> ranked as the most <span class="insertion">learned among all the brahmins</span>. </p>
<p>“Near the border,] not far from the great kingdom <span class="insertion">known as</span> Padma the brahmin Nayātikrama heard that all the brahmins, viz. 84,000 <span class="insertion">persons</span>, had gathered together at one place, that their proficiency was being tested <span class="insertion">to find out who would</span> rank foremost so as to be given the five hundred ounces of gold … and the large <span class="insertion">herd of</span> one thousand head of cattle. </p>
<p>“Then it occurred to the brahmin Nayātikrama: ‘Now why do I beg from house to house? <span class="insertion">I</span> had better go to that enormous gathering to participate in the proficiency contest.’ </p>
<p>“So the brahmin Nayātikrama went to the venue of that giant assembly. When the large multitude of brahmins saw the brahmin Nayātikrama coming from afar, they all shouted at the top of their voices: ‘Excellent! The <span class="insertion">real</span> chief (<i lang="pi">svāmin</i>) of the sacrifice <span class="insertion">gathering</span>. Now <span class="insertion">this function</span> proves immensely useful—so much so that Brahma is descending in person.’ </p>
<p>“All the 84,000 brahmins rose and went to receive <span class="insertion">him</span>. With one accord <span class="insertion">they</span> cheered: ‘Welcome (<i lang="pi">svāgatam</i>), Great Brahmā!’ </p>
<p>“Being <span class="insertion">accorded such tribute,</span> the brahmin Nayātikrama thought: ‘These brahmins take me to be Brahmā; but I am not Brahmā.’ </p>
<p>“So the brahmin Nayātikrama addressed the brahmins with the <span class="insertion">following</span> words: ‘Please stop, noble ones! Do not call me Brahmā! Have you not heard of Yajñada, teacher of so many brahmins <span class="insertion">living</span> in the north, in the Himālayas, <span class="insertion">whose</span> mastery of astrology and geography <span class="insertion">is such that</span> there is nothing <span class="insertion">he</span> does not <span class="insertion">know</span>?’ </p>
<p>“The brahmins replied: ‘We have only heard of him, but we have never seen <span class="insertion">him</span>.’ </p>
<p>“‘I am,’ the brahmin Nayātikrama introduced himself, his disciple Nayātikrama by name. </p>
<p>“Then the brahmin Nayātikrama turned towards the chief of that mammoth assembly and said: ‘How about an expert’s showing me his expertise?’ </p>
<p>“Now the chief of that gathering impeccably recited to the brahmin Nayātikrama the <span class="insertion">texts of</span> the Three Collections.</p>
<p>“After that the brahmin Nayātikrama again asked the chief: ‘Are <span class="insertion">you</span> able to recite the Sentence <span class="insertion">Consisting of</span> Five Hundred Words?’</p>
<p>“‘I do not know what <span class="insertion">you</span> mean,’ replied the chief. ‘What is the Sentence <span class="insertion">Consisting of</span> Five Hundred Words like?’ </p>
<p>“‘O noble ones,’ requested the brahmin Nayātikrama, ‘please listen attentively; <span class="insertion">I</span> will recite the Sentence <span class="insertion">Consisting of</span> Five Hundred Words <span class="insertion">describing</span> the marks of a great being. </p>
<p>“O bhikṣus<span class="insertion">,” said the Exalted One</span>, “you should know that on that occasion the brahmin Nayātikrama <span class="insertion">showed his</span> proficiency in reciting the <span class="insertion">texts of</span> the Three Collections and the Sentence <span class="insertion">Consisting of</span> Five Hundred Words <span class="insertion">describing</span> the marks of a great being. The 84,000 brahmins, overjoyed as never before, were all <span class="insertion">agreed</span> that this was the first time for them to listen to the Sentence <span class="insertion">Consisting of</span> Five Hundred Words <span class="insertion">describing</span> the marks of a great being and that as from that moment ‘the Venerable’ (<i lang="pi">bhadanta</i>) <span class="insertion">Nayātikrama</span> should be ranked foremost and be <span class="insertion">their</span> chief.</p>
<p>“When the Brahmin Nayātikrama had risen from his seat and again had sat down on the seat reserved for the chief <span class="insertion">of the assembly</span>, he very much disliked his having been ranked foremost in that gathering. He thought to himself with regard to the vows <span class="insertion">formerly</span> taken by him. ‘These people have made me move to another set so as to fill the vacancy. Now that I have made known scriptural authority, it will be difficult <span class="insertion">for me</span> to keep up my practice (<i lang="pi">śīla</i>). Supposing there is a really virtuous person who whole-heartedly keeps his vows; he performs actions in conformity with places he hopes to be born in. I <span class="insertion">would</span> in fact destroy for good the virtue (<i lang="pi">guṇa</i>) <span class="insertion">resulting from my brahminical studies and practice should I become attached to name and fame</span>.’ </p>
<p>“Then the person in charge of the munificence <span class="insertion">function</span> (<i lang="pi">dānasvāmin</i>) provided five hundred ounces of gold, one golden staff, one golden jug for ablutions, one thousand head of cattle and one beautiful girl. <span class="insertion">He</span> handed over <span class="insertion">these various <i lang="pi">yajña</i> ingredients</span> to the <span class="insertion">new</span> chairman by facilitating him with a sacred formula (<i lang="pi">mantra</i>). ‘Herewith,’ said the chairman to the person in charge of the munificence <span class="insertion">function</span>, ‘I accept the five hundred ounces of gold, the golden staff and jug for ablutions in order to offer them to my master for his support. As to the girl and the one thousand head of cattle, <span class="insertion">they may</span> be returned to your people because I do not need them, and I do not have the habit of amassing property.’</p>
<p>“After receiving <span class="insertion">the five hundred ounces of gold</span>, the golden staff and jug, the brahmin Nayātikrama entered the great kingdom <span class="insertion">known as</span> Padma. The name of its king was Dīpa. As the ruler of that country he had invited the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara and a <span class="insertion">large</span> multitude (<i lang="pi">gaṇa</i>) of his bhikṣus to an offering or robes and <span class="insertion">alms</span>-food. </p>
<p>“In the <span class="insertion">main</span> city of that kingdom the king issued the order that no fragrant flowers should be sold by any of its inhabitants. Anyone selling them would incur severe punishment. Even if he himself took the liberty of buying <span class="insertion">flowers</span> it should not be compulsory to bypass <span class="insertion">the order</span> and sell them. </p>
<p>“Again he had the people clean up <span class="insertion">all places</span>, sweep and sprinkle them <span class="insertion">with water</span>. Fouled earth and sand had to be removed. Silken banners and canopies were fluttering <span class="insertion">in the wind</span>, perfumed water was showered on the ground; <span class="insertion">all these</span> preparations created <span class="insertion">an atmosphere of tidiness and serenity</span> to which sensual pleasures do not bear comparison. </p>
<p>“Witnessing <span class="insertion">these ongoing preparations</span>, the brahmin <span class="insertion">Nayātikrama</span> asked <span class="insertion">some</span> passers-by: ‘<span class="insertion">All places</span> are being swept and sprinkled <span class="insertion">with water</span>, roads are being cleared of refuse, silken banners and canopies are fluttering <span class="insertion">in the wind</span>; <span class="insertion">this atmosphere of tidiness and serenity</span> is incomparable! What special event is it? It is <span class="insertion">certainly</span> not the crown prince, the heir to the throne, who is going to marry his graceful bride.’ </p>
<p>“‘Does the brahmin not know it?’ the passers-by were wondering and <span class="insertion">went on</span> to say: ‘For today the king of the great Padma kingdom has invited the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara, the Fully and Completely Enlightened One, to an offering of robes and <span class="insertion">alms</span>-food. For this very reason the roads are being cleared, silken banners and canopies are fluttering <span class="insertion">in the wind</span>.’ </p>
<p>“On hearing this <span class="insertion">news</span> the brahmin uttered these words, pregnant with meaning, which he had memorised: ‘It is extremely rare for a Tathāgata to appear in the world, and since he appears only occasionally (<i lang="pi">kadā cit karhi cit</i>) <span class="insertion">after immense intervals of time</span>, it is practically impossible to see him. It is exceedingly rare for a Tathāgata to appear in the world—as rare as the <i lang="pi">udumbara</i> flower blossoming only occasionally <span class="insertion">after immense intervals of time</span>. Moreover, in the brahminical scriptures there is the following saying: It is extremely rare for two persons to appear in the world. For which two persons? It is extremely rare for a Tathāgata and for a noble universal monarch to appear in the world.’</p>
<p>“Then the following occurred to him: ‘Now I could requite the Buddha’s favour (<i lang="pi">upakāra</i>) at once by respectfully offering Him, the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara, the five hundred ounces of gold.’ </p>
<p>“And again it came into his mind: ‘According to what the scriptures say, a Tathāgata neither accepts gold and silver nor other precious things. I could instead use the five hundred ounces of gold to buy fragrant flowers in order to shower the Tathāgata with them. Thereafter the Brahmin entered the city with a view to buying fragrant flowers.’ </p>
<p>“‘Does the brahmin not know it?’ also the passers-by in the city were wondering and <span class="insertion">went on</span> to say: ‘Our king has issued the order that anyone selling fragrant flowers should be punished severely.’ </p>
<p>“The brahmin Nayātikrama, was at a loss and thought: ‘<span class="insertion">I</span> just do not know how to get flowers.’</p>
<p>“Having decided to return and having left the city, he stayed outside the gates <span class="insertion">of the city</span>. There was a Brahmin girl named Susvādā, carrying a water jug so as to fetch water. In one hand she was holding five flowers. </p>
<p>“On seeing that girl the Brahmin said to her: ‘Distinguished (<i lang="pi">mahat</i>) younger sister, I need the flowers and hope the younger sister will be kind enough to sell them to me.’ </p>
<p>“‘Since when,’ replied the brahmin girl, ‘am I your younger sister? You do not <span class="insertion">even</span> know who are my parents.’ </p>
<p>“‘That girl is really good hearted,’ the brahmin Nayātikrama thought to himself, she just wants to make fun <span class="insertion">of me</span>.’ Again he said <span class="insertion">to her</span>: ‘Good (<i lang="pi">bhadra</i>) girl, will you kindly <span class="insertion">sell me</span> these flowers at any price.’ </p>
<p>“‘Do you not know,’ replied the brahmin girl, ‘that His Majesty has prohibited the sale of flowers?’ </p>
<p>“‘Good girl,’ said the brahmin, ‘as for that matter, do not be concerned. What has the king to do with you? I urgently need these five flowers, and you will have got a good bargain.’ </p>
<p>“‘What are you going to do with the flowers so urgently needed by you?’ asked the brahmin girl. </p>
<p>“The brahmin: ‘I <span class="insertion">can</span> see there is fertile ground that needs to be cultivated <span class="insertion">by means of</span> these flowers <span class="insertion">for growing roots of merit</span>.’</p>
<p>“The brahmin girl: ‘These flowers have been cut off from their roots; so they can by no means strike <span class="insertion">root</span> again. How can you say you want to grow them?’ </p>
<p>“The brahmin: ‘Today, for instance, I see a fertile field to be cultivated; though bleak and bare <span class="insertion">things</span> grow in it again and again. All the more <span class="insertion">fertile is the field in which roots of merit can be cultivated by dint of</span> these flowers.’ </p>
<p>“The brahmin girl: ‘What is this fertile field like in which, though bleak and bare, <span class="insertion">after</span> cultivation <span class="insertion">things</span> grow?’ </p>
<p>“The brahmin: ‘Good girl, the Buddha, the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara, the Fully and Completely Enlightened One, has appeared in the world.’ </p>
<p>“The girl: ‘What is the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara like?’ </p>
<p>“The Brahmin: ‘The Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara whose merit is perfect, is endowed with such <span class="insertion">-and-such</span> (<i lang="pi">īdṛśa</i>) virtues and such <span class="insertion">-and-such</span> (T2,599a) conduct.’ </p>
<p>“The girl: ‘What kind of merit does a virtuous person strive for?’ </p>
<p>“The brahmin: ‘I am filled with the aspiration to become—like the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara—fully and completely enlightend in a future existence, being <span class="insertion">endowed with</span> virtues and conduct like him.’</p>
<p>“The girl: ‘If you promise to accept me as your wife existence after existence I shall give you the flowers.’ </p>
<p>“The brahmin: ‘As for my behaviour (<i lang="pi">samudācāra</i>), now my mind is free from clinging.’ </p>
<p>“The girl: ‘Let me be your wife in future existences just as now I do not desire to be your wife physically.’ </p>
<p>“The brahmin Nayātikrama: ‘A bodhisattva’s manner of conduct excludes one’s sparing oneself. If you want to be my wife <span class="insertion">you</span> should overcome selfish attachment (<i lang="pi">mamakāra</i>).’ </p>
<p>“The girl: ‘I will by no means betray your aspiring after generosity (<i lang="pi">dānādhyāśaya</i>). Let me with the right motivation make use of my body, donating it to others. <span class="insertion">Thus</span> I will certainly not betray <span class="insertion">our</span> aspiring after generosity.’ </p>
<p>“Then <span class="insertion">the brahmin Nayātikrama</span> took the five hundred gold coins and bought with them the five flowers. After both <span class="insertion">he himself</span> and that girl had vowed <span class="insertion">to embark on a bodhisattva’s practice</span> they parted company. </p>
<p>“Meanwhile, the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara, the Fully and Completely Enlightened One, had put on his <span class="insertion">outer</span> robes and taken up his alms bowl. Heading the bhikṣus accompanying him in order of seniority, he entered the great Padma kingdom. </p>
<p>“Seeing him some distance away, an <span class="insertion">inspiring</span> appearance of genuine modesty, the brahmin Nayātikrama was not disappointed. The Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara’s bearing was calm and dignified. He was possessed of the thirty-two <span class="insertion">primary</span> and the eighty secondary marks of an extraordinary being (<i lang="pi">dvātriṃśan mahāpuruṣalakṣaṇāni, aśīty anuvyañjanāni</i>). <span class="insertion">On seeing him one was</span> reminded of pellucid water free of all turbidity, allowing the light to penetrate it without hindrance. Again, <span class="insertion">he</span> resembled a jewel mountain (<i lang="pi">ratnaparvata</i>) surpassing all <span class="insertion">other</span> mountains. </p>
<p>“Having this experience, the brahmin Nayātikrama became elated (<i lang="pi">sumanas</i>). Holding the five flowers meant for the Tathāgata, he went to where Dīpaṃkara was and stood at one side; then he said to the Buddha Dīpaṃkara: ‘It is to be hoped that something will be obtained. Supposing now the Exalted One decides not to impart anything, then it would be preferable to put an end to one’s life on the spot. It would not be worthwhile living on.’ </p>
<p>“‘Brahmin,’ said the Exalted One, ‘it is not possible thanks to these five flowers to impart the Complete and Highest Enlightenment.’ </p>
<p>“‘I <span class="insertion">only</span> hope,’ replied the brahmin, ‘the Exalted One will be so kind as to teach me how to embark on a bodhisattva’s practice.’ </p>
<p>“‘A bodhisattva’s practice,’ explained the Buddha Dīpaṃkara, ‘excludes one’s sparing oneself.’ </p>
<p>“On this occasion the Brahmin uttered the following verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha"><p><span class="dquo">‘</span>No<span class="insertion">body</span> dares take hold of his parents and give them<br> Away to other people. The Buddhas, too surpassing<br>
Other wise (
<i lang="pi">vyakta</i>) persons, dare not give away<br> Their parents. Sun (!) and moon circling the earth –<br>
These two cannot be given away either. Everything else<br>
Can be given away; it will not be difficult<br>
To make up one’s mind 
<span class="insertion">to do so</span>.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Then also the Buddha Dīpaṃkara addressed the brahmin with these verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha"><p><span class="dquo">‘</span>The way you talk about giving away is not the Tathāgata’s<br> Way to talk about. 
<span class="insertion">A bodhisattva</span> should be <span class="insertion">prepared to</span><br> Put up with a hundred million aeons of great<br>
Hardship 
<span class="insertion">involving the giving away of one’s</span><br> Head, trunk, ears, eyes, one’s wife, children, one’s<br>
Realm, treasures, carriages, horses, servants and<br>
Retinue. If 
<span class="insertion">you</span> can bear all this, then you<br> May make 
<span class="insertion">your</span> resolution.’</p>

<p>“Furthermore, the young brahmin (<i lang="pi">māṇava</i>) uttered these verses:</p> 
<blockquote class="gatha"><p><span class="dquo">‘</span>The high mountain of great hardship burning like<br> Fire—for a hundred million aeons 
<span class="insertion">I</span> will put up<br> With carrying it on 
<span class="insertion">my</span> head. <span class="insertion">My</span> aspiring for<br> Supreme enlightenment (
<i lang="pi">bodhicitta</i>) shall not be<br> Impaired. All 
<span class="insertion">I</span> wish now is to make my resolution.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Now the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara kept silent, and the Brahmin, holding in his hand the five flowers, knelt down with his right knee on the ground and scattered <span class="insertion">the flowers</span> over the Tathāgata. In doing this, he said: ‘May this action be conducive to having merit also in a future existence. Not unlike the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara, I shall realise Full and Complete Enlightenment.’ </p>
<p>“On the spot he let down <span class="insertion">his long</span> hair, spread it on a muddy <span class="insertion">section of the road and said</span>: ‘If the Tathāgata approves of my resolution <span class="insertion">He</span> may kindly cross the muddy section by stepping on my hair.’</p>
<p>“O bhikṣus,” <span class="insertion">said the Exalted One</span>, “you should know that the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara looked into the brahmin’s mind and scrutinised what he was thinking. Then he said to the brahmin: ‘In a future existence you will realise Full and Complete Enlightenment and become the Tathāgata Śākyamuni Buddha.’ </p>
<p>“At that time a fellow student of the brahmin Nayātikrama, Dharmaruci by name, stood next to the Tathāgata. Witnessing the Buddha Dīpaṃkara’s approval of the Brahmin Nayātikrama’s resolution by stepping on <span class="insertion">the latter’s</span> hair, he remonstrated: ‘How can this shaveling of a śramaṇa be so impudent as to trample on this pure brahmin’s hair? This is not a <span class="insertion">civilised</span> man’s behaviour!’ </p>
<p>“As for the brahmin Yajñada of those days,” asked the Buddha the bhikṣus, “do you <span class="insertion">think</span> he was an altogether unique person? Do not regard him as such because the person of that time <span class="insertion">known as</span> Yajñada is none other than Śuddhodana. As for the former chief of the <span class="insertion">assembly of</span> 84,000. brahmins, he is none other than Devadatta, and I was at that time that very Brahmin Nayātikrama. As far as the Brahmin girl of those days is concerned who sold the flowers, she is now Gopī, and the person in charge of the <i lang="pi">yajña</i> <span class="insertion">function</span> is none other than the Brahmin Daṇḍapāṇi.</p>
<p>“Dharmaruci who hurled abusive language at the Tathāgata in those days is in fact the Dharmaruci of today. For innumerable aeons this Dharmaruci was again and again born as a domestic animal, and in his <span class="insertion">second but</span> last life he took on the body of a fish that measured seven hundred <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>, living in the Great Ocean. That existence having come to an end, he was born here <span class="insertion">again as a human being</span>. </p>
<p>“By always being close to a spiritual friend (<i lang="pi">kalyāṇamitra</i>), by relying on a spiritual friend one habituates oneself to karmically wholesome actions conducing to the <span class="insertion">spiritual</span> faculties, to the gates (<i lang="pi">dvāra</i>) of deliverance and to supernormal knowledge (<i lang="pi">abhijñā</i>).</p>
<p>“It is for this very reason that I have said: ‘Here after a long time.’ And Dharmaruci, too, expressed himself: ‘Indeed, Exalted One, here after a long time.’ Thus, O bhikṣus, you should constantly cultivate <span class="insertion">mindfulness</span> with regard to physical, vocal and mental actions. Thus, O bhikṣus, you should train. </p>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the bhikṣus were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
