</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa10.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the Blessed One said to the monks:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa10.2"></a>“Form is impermanent, what is impermanent is <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>, what is <i lang="pi">dukkha</i> is not-self, what is not self is not mine. One who contemplates like this is reckoned to be contemplating truly and rightly. In the same way feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is impermanent, what is impermanent is <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>, what is <i lang="pi">dukkha</i> is not-self, what is not self is not mine. One who contemplates like this is reckoned to be contemplating truly and rightly.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa10.3"></a>“A noble disciple who contemplates like this becomes liberated from form, liberated from feeling … perception … formations … consciousness. I say such a <span class="supplied">person</span> is liberated from birth, old age, disease, death, worry, sorrow, pain and vexation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa10.4"></a>Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
