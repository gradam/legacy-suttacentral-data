<h1 class="supplied">Discourse on Being Agitated</h1>
</a></hgroup>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa21.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. A that time a certain monk rose up from his seat, paid homage to the Buddha and said to the Buddha:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa21.2"></a>“<span class="supplied">May</span> the Blessed One teach me the essentials of the Dharma in brief. On having heard the Dharma I shall alone and in a quiet place reflect on it with energy. Having become established in it without negligence,<a class="t" id="t4c"></a> I shall reflect on that for whose sake a clansman’s son out of right faith goes forth to homelessness … up to … knowing myself that there will be no receiving of any further existence.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa21.3"></a>At that time the Blessed One said to that monk: “It is well, it is well, that you speak like this: ‘It would be well if the Blessed One would teach me the essentials of the Dharma in brief. On having heard the Dharma, I shall alone and in a quiet place reflect on it with energy. Being established in it without negligence … up to … knowing myself that there will be no receiving of any further existence.’ Is it like this?” The monk said to the Buddha: “It is like this, Blessed One.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa21.4"></a>The Buddha said to the monk: “Listen, listen and pay careful attention to what I will tell you. Monk, at the time of being agitated, one is bound by Māra. If one is not agitated, one is free from the Evil One.” The monk said to the Buddha: “I understood, Blessed One, I understood Well Gone One!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa21.5"></a>The Buddha said to the monk: “How do you understand in full the meaning of the teaching I herein spoke in brief?” The monk said to the Buddha: “Blessed One, at the time of being agitated by form, one is bound by Māra. If one is not agitated, one is free from the Evil One. In the same way at the time of being agitated by feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, one is bound by Māra. If one is not agitated, one is free from the Evil One. Blessed One, I thus understand in full the meaning of the teaching herein spoken in brief.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa21.6"></a>The Buddha said to the monk: “It is well, it is well, that you understand in full the meaning of the teaching I herein spoke in brief. Why is that? At the time of being agitated by form, one is bound by Māra. If one is not agitated, one is free from the Evil One. In the same way, at the time of being agitated by feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, one is bound by Māra. If one is not agitated, one is free from the Evil One.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa21.7"></a>… up to … he himself knew that there will be no receiving of any further existence … attaining liberation of the mind he became an arahant.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa22.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time there was a monk by the name of Kappa who approached the Buddha, paid homage with his head at the <span class="supplied">Buddha’s</span> feet, withdrew to stand at one side and said to the Buddha:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa22.2"></a>“As the Blessed One has spoken about the mind of a monk attaining being well liberated Blessed One, how does the mind of a monk attain being well liberated?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa22.3"></a>At that time the Blessed One said to that monk: “It is well, it is well, that you are able to ask the Tathāgata about the mind being well liberated. It is well, Kappa. Listen, listen and pay careful attention to what I will tell you.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa22.4"></a>“Kappa, you should contemplate with understanding that whatever form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all <span class="supplied">form</span>, every instance of it, is impermanent. Having rightly contemplated it as impermanent, you will remove craving for form. Having removed craving for form, your mind will be well liberated.<a class="t" id="t5a"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa22.5"></a>“In the same way contemplating <span class="supplied">whatever</span> feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all <span class="supplied">consciousness</span>, every instance of it, is impermanent. Having rightly contemplated it as impermanent, you will remove craving for consciousness. Having removed craving for consciousness, I say, your mind will be well liberated.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa22.6"></a>“Kappa, a monk who in this way has well liberated the mind is reckoned by the Tathāgata to have well liberated the mind. Why is that? Because of having eradicated craving and desire. One who has eradicated craving and desire is reckoned by the Tathāgata to have well liberated the mind.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa22.7"></a>Then, on hearing what the Buddha had said, the mind of the monk Kappa was greatly delighted. He paid homage to the Buddha and withdrew. At that time the monk Kappa, having received the Buddha’s instruction, reflecting on it alone in a quiet place with diligence and being established in it without negligence … up to … he himself knew that there will be no receiving of any further existence. Having well liberated the mind he became an arahant.</p>
