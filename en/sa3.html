<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa3.2"></a>“Not understanding form, not having knowledge regarding it, not eradicating <span class="supplied">desire for</span> it,<a class="t" id="t1b"></a> not being free from desire for it, one is unable to eradicate <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>. In the same way not understanding feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, not having knowledge regarding it, not eradicating <span class="supplied">desire for</span> it, not being free from desire for it, one is unable to eradicate <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa3.3"></a>“Monks, understanding form, having knowledge regarding it, eradicating <span class="supplied">desire for</span> it, being free from desire for it, one is able to eradicate <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>.
