<h1>The Discourse about Mocking</h1>
</hgroup>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ud5.9.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was walking on walking tour amongst the Kosalans, together with a great Community of monks. Then at that time a great many young brāhmaṇas were passing by not far from the Gracious One in a mocking manner. The Gracious One saw those many young brāhmaṇas passing by not far away in a mocking manner.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ud5.9.2"></a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ud5.9.3"></a>“The forgetful, speaking unsuitable words, <span class="supplied">though</span> appearing to be wise,<br>
Stretching their mouths as much as they want, are led on by what they don't understand.”</p>
