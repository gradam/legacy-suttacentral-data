<h3>Connected Discourses on the Truths</h3>
<h1>18. True Knowledge</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: “Venerable sir, it is said, ‘true knowledge, true knowledge.’ What is true knowledge, venerable sir, and in what way has one arrived at true knowledge?” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.430"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Bhikkhu, knowledge of suffering, knowledge of the origin of suffering, knowledge of the cessation of suffering, knowledge of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: this is called true knowledge, bhikkhu, and it is in this way that one has arrived at true knowledge.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Therefore, bhikkhu, an exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is suffering.’… An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’”</p>
