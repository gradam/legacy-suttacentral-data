<h3>Connected Discourses on the Establishments of Mindfulness</h3>
<h1>25. A Certain Brahmin</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapiṇḍika’s Park. Then a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Master Gotama, what is the cause and reason why the true Dhamma does not endure long after a Tathagata has attained final Nibbana? And what is the cause and reason why the true Dhamma endures long after a Tathagata has attained final Nibbana?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“It is, brahmin, because the four establishments of mindfulness are not developed and cultivated that the true Dhamma does not endure long after a Tathagata has attained final Nibbana. And it is because the four establishments of mindfulness are developed and cultivated that the true Dhamma endures long after a Tathagata has attained final Nibbana. What four? … <span class="add">as in §22</span> … It is because these four establishments of mindfulness are not developed and cultivated … are developed and cultivated that the true Dhamma endures long after a Tathagata has attained final Nibbana.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>When this was said, that brahmin said to the Blessed One: ‘Magnificent, Master Gotama!… From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>
