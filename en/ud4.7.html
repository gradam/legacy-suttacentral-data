<h1>The Discourse about Sāriputta</h1>
</hgroup>

<p><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta's Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Then at that time venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far away from the Gracious One, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, with few longings, satisfied, completely secluded, unattached, with energy aroused, applying <span class="supplied">himself</span> to the higher mind.</p>

<p>The Gracious One saw venerable Sāriputta, who was sitting not far away, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, with few longings, satisfied, completely secluded, detached, with energy aroused, applying <span class="supplied">himself</span> to the higher mind.</p>

<p>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="verse">
<p>“For he with higher mind, for the heedful one, <br>
For the sage who is training in the path of sagacity, <br>
There are no griefs for such a one, <br>
For a peaceful one—he is one who is always mindful.”</p>

</blockquote>
