<h1>Sujāta is praised</h1>
</a></hgroup>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-1.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha stayed in a mango grove in the country of Mithilā.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-1.2"></a>At this time the Venerable Sujāta had just gone forth and shaved off his hair and beard. He came to the Buddha, paid homage by touching the Buddha’s feet and sat down to one side. The Buddha told the other monks: “This son of a good family, Sujāta, is splendid in two ways: First, his appearance is of extraordinary beauty, his features exceptionally handsome. Second, he was able to shave off his hair and beard and clothe his body with the Dharma robe. Feeling deeply that family life was all too ephemeral, he went forth and pursued the way. He ended all afflictions, is filled with purity, has liberated his mind <span class="supplied">from desire</span>, has attained liberation <span class="supplied">from ignorance</span> by wisdom.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-1.3"></a>In this very body he has attained the unconditioned, forever ended <span class="supplied">the cycle of</span> life and death. Established in the pure life, he will not have to endure another existence.”</p>
<p>Having said this, the Buddha spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-1.4"></a>“The monk, always calm and concentrated /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>cuts off desire and abandons life and death;<br>
he abides in his final body /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>he can defeat Māra’s armies,<br>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-2.2"></a>At that time the World-honored One was teaching surrounded by a huge crowd, when a monk approached him, his face gaunt, not in the least impressive. The monk paid homage to the Buddha’s feet, raised his hands with palms together <span class="supplied">in salutation</span> to the other monks and sat to one side. There the monks all had this thought: “How is it that this monk looks so wasted, not in the least impressive?” The World-honored One, now, knew what they were thinking and said to them: “Monks, have you seen the monk who just saluted me?” The monks answered the Buddha: “Yes, World-honored One, we have seen him.” Then the Buddha further said: “You must not think that he is inferior. Why? This monk has done what is to be done, attained Arahatship, cast off the heavy burden, ended all bonds of becoming <span class="supplied">that lead to rebirth</span>, found true liberation. You should not allow yourselves to think disparagingly of him. Once you have attained my level of insight, you may attempt to judge him. If you judge him presumptuously, you harm yourselves.”</p>
<p>Then the World-honored One spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-2.3"></a>“The peacock, though his body may be endowed with beautiful colors /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span> cannot soar as high as the swan.<br>

<h1>Devadatta and Ajātasattu</h1>
</a></hgroup>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-3.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying in Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove of Kalanda.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-3.2"></a>At that time Devadatta reached the fourth <i>jhāna</i> <span class="supplied">stage of meditation. After his experience</span> he had this thought: “Who in this country of Magadha is the most powerful?” And again he thought: “These days Ajātasattu has inherited the throne. How if I were to bring him under my influence—I could control everybody in the kingdom.” Devadatta having thought thus, went to Ajātasattu’s place, assumed the form of an elephant treasure, entered through the door and left without using the door. Next he assumed the form of a horse treasure and did likewise. Then he turned back into a monk, entered through the door and left flying through the air. Then he turned into a small child adorned with jewels, pearls and jade, his body beautiful and he sat on Ajātasattu’s knee. There Ajātasattu fondled him, crooned to him and kissed him, and <span class="supplied">it so happened that</span> some of his spittle drooled into Devadatta’s mouth. Because Devadatta desired gain and profit, he swallowed the spittle. Then Devadatta changed from his child form back to his own body. When Ajātasattu saw all this, he developed the wrong view that Devadatta’s magical skill in changing his form surpassed that of the World-honored One. He began to venerate Devadatta deeply. Every day he sent 500 chariots of food as a gift to him and Devadatta and his 500 followers all partook of these offerings.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-3.3"></a>A number of monks, having put on their robes and taken their begging-bowls, entered the town to beg for food. Having eaten, they went to the Buddha and told him: “World-honored One! When we entered the town to beg for food, we saw Devadatta gathering people from far and near and receiving great offerings.” The Buddha said to the monks: “You should not develop a covetous mind, as Devadatta has done. Why not? This Devadatta will harm himself for the sake of gain and profit. He is just like the banana plant which dies after bearing fruit, like the reed and the bamboo <span class="supplied">after flowering</span>, and the mule after getting pregnant. He is just like these. Devadatta receiving gain is not different from these. Devadatta is ignorant, without knowledge, does not know this rule, and will suffer because of this in the long night <span class="supplied">of rebirths in ignorance</span>. Therefore, seeing how Devadatta harms himself for the sake of gain, you should give up all greed and craving and reflect carefully. You should understand this: do not crave for gains.”</p>
<p>Then he spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-3.4"></a>“The banana plant dies after bringing forth fruit /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>it is the same with bamboo and with reeds.<br>
Likewise, those craving for gain /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>are bound to harm themselves.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-3.5"></a>Those who have attained gain /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>will find decrease and decline.<br>
Childishly busying themselves about gain /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>they harm the pure and good,<br>
like the palm tree <span class="supplied">when bearing too many fruits</span> /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>they break and become barren.”</p>

<h1>Monk “Elephant-head”</h1>
</a></hgroup>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-4.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, the Anāthapiṇḍika Park. At that time, when the hour to go on almsround had come, a number of monks put on their robes, took their begging bowls and entered the town to beg for food. There the monks heard that the monk “Elephant-head,” a member of the Sakya clan, had fallen ill in the town and died. Having finished the meal they returned, went to the Buddha, paid homage at his feet and sat to one side. They said to the Buddha: “World-honored One, this morning we put on our robes, took our begging bowls and entered the town to beg for food. There we heard that the monk “Elephant-head” had died. May the World-honored One explain to us where the monk “Elephant-head” will be reborn, what karmic fruit he will obtain.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-4.2"></a>The Buddha said to the monks: “Those that cause the three negative factors to increase must, after the body fails and life comes to an end, fall into hell. What are the three negative factors? They are known as the increase of greed, of ignorance and of hate. Now this monk was guilty of the three negative factors. Understand, monks, that he will fall into hell.”</p>
<p>At that time the Buddha spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-4.3"></a>“If one gives rise to an unwholesome mind /<br>

Therefore, one should cut off /<br>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-5.2"></a>At that time the elder Nanda was <span class="supplied">always</span> wearing new and spotless robes and carrying the best alms bowls. He gave himself airs and with an arrogant attitude thought himself superior to others. Trying to advance himself, he was saying haughtily: “I am a younger brother of the Buddha, the son of his maternal aunt.” Thereupon a number of monks went to the Buddha, paid homage at his feet, sat to one side and said to the Buddha: “World-honored One! The monk Nanda is always wearing new and spotless robes, is carrying the best bowls. Calling himself “younger brother of the Buddha” and saying he is “the son of the maternal aunt,” he is giving himself airs and treating others haughtily.” When the Buddha heard this, he sent a monk to fetch Nanda. As ordered by the Buddha, the monk went to Nanda and said to him: “The World-honored One calls you!” When Nanda heard this he went to the Buddha, paid homage at his feet and stood to one side. The Buddha said to him: “Is it true that you are wearing new and spotless robes, carrying the best bowls, saying you are my younger brother, the son of my maternal aunt, and behaving haughtily towards others? Is this the case?” Nanda said: “It is true, World-honored One!” The Buddha said to him: “You should not do this. From now on, enjoy living in the forest, among graves, under trees, in worn-out robes, begging for food. If you are my younger brother, born of my maternal aunt, you should practice in these ways, work in this way.”</p>

<h1>Nanda 2 - Nanda is praised</h1>
</a></hgroup>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-6.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-6.2"></a>At that time the venerable Nanda went to the Buddha, paid homage at his feet and sat to one side. There the World-honored One said to the monks: “Among those teaching the <i>Dhamma</i>, Nanda is the best. Among those of good family, upright, endowed with pleasant appearance, he is the best. When it comes to cut off strong desire, Nanda is the best. When it comes to harnessing the senses, to knowing when one has had one’s fill, to practicing the path diligently throughout the night, striving for enlightenment, constantly aware of the present, in these Nanda is the best.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-6.3"></a>What is meant by saying Nanda harnesses the senses? He does not get attached to any visible form, sound, scent, taste, touch, or any mental phenomena, this is what is meant by sayinghe harnesses his senses.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-6.4"></a>What is meant by saying Nanda knows when one has had one’s fill? He eats merely to stop hunger, not because he wants to be attractive or strong. In order to practice the path, he restrains himself and is contented. <span class="supplied">Eating is but</span> like greasing a chariot. It is also like treating a skin disease; one does not do it because one wants to be attractive, to look glossy and strong. This is what is meant by saying Nanda knows when one has had one’s fill.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-6.5"></a>What is meant by saying Nanda practices the way diligently throughout the night? By day he wanders about calmly, by night he sits in meditation, dispelling the hindrances in his mind. In the first part of the night, having washed his feet, he sits upright, his mind focused in front of him, he enters the stages of concentrative meditation (<i>jhāna</i>). In the middle part of the night he lies down on his right side, leg resting on leg. His mind is focused on clarity, practicing mindfulness. When the last part of the night begins, he again sits upright, his mind focused in front of him. This is how Nanda, with firm mind practices evenly throughout the night. Sons of good family, Nanda has attained highest enlightenment. The mind of the monk Nanda is focused, not distracted, like seeing clearly in every direction: east, south, west, and north. With focused mind he practices insight, does not allow himself to become distracted. Pleasant sensations, unpleasant sensations, or sensations neither pleasant or unpleasant, he knows they are all dependently arisen. He knows the arising and passing away of all these sensations sometimes takes longer, sometimes happens sooner. He also knows that the arising and passing away of all thoughts is according to this or that reason or circumstance, that all mental states are based on this or that reason or circumstance.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-6.6"></a>May all you monks practice like this, may you harness your senses, know your fill with eating and drinking, throughout the night practice diligently and strive for enlightenment like Nanda.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-6.7"></a>The Buddha said to the monks: “I now instruct you to emulate Nanda’s way of practice. <span class="supplied">And</span> if there should be a monk whose way of practice is just like Nanda’s, then I now instruct you to emulate that also.”</p>
<p>Then the World-honored One spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-6.8"></a>“If one can harness one’s senses well /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>concentrate one’s mind and eat and drink with restraint,<br>
then I call this person a wise person /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>knowing well the nature of the arising of the mind;<br>
for this I commend Nanda /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>you <span class="supplied">too</span> should train like this.”</p>

Relying on his kinship with the Buddha, he often harbored arrogance, did not respect the elder and virtuous monks, and behaved without conscience and shame. He often talked a lot, but when the other monks said little in return, he became angry. Some monks having observed this a few times, went to the Buddha, holding their hands with palms together <span class="supplied">in salutation</span> paid homage at his feet and sat to one side. They told the Buddha: “World-honored One! Tissa often harbors arrogance, says of himself: ‘I am the son of the Buddha’s paternal aunt.’ He thinks little of the elder monks.

When he received the summons, he went to the Buddha, and having paid homage at his feet, sat to one side. The <i>Tathāgata</i> then said to Tissa: “Is it true that when meeting the elder monks, your mind is without respect, without conscience and shame? Is it true that you are talking a lot and when the other monks say little in return, you become angry?” Tissa answered: “It is true, World-honored One!” The Buddha told Tissa: “Especially since you are the son of my paternal aunt, you should generate deep respect towards the venerable and virtuous elders and all monks, and your demeanor should be conscientious and with a sense of shame. You should speak less, listen to what others say, and be tolerant.”</p>

The Buddha asked Visākha: “Is it true that you assemble the monks and preach <i>Dhamma</i> to them and that they listen whole-heartedly?

The monks, once finished with the robes, went to the Buddha, paid homage at his feet and sat to one side. They told the Buddha: “World-honored One! We monks were sitting in the <i>Dhamma</i> hall, stitching our robes and this young monk sat between us, not doing anything to make robes for the community.” The Buddha said to the young monk: “Is it true that you did not help with the robes?” The monk answered the Buddha: “World-honored One!

This monk has done what is to be done, attained Arahatship, ended all defilements, cast off the heavy burden, and found right knowledge. His mind is liberated.”</p>
<p>At that time the Buddha spoke a verse:</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-10.2"></a>At that time there was a monk called Thera, who lived alone, and praised living alone. At one time some monks went to the Buddha, paid homage at his feet, sat to one side, and told the Buddha: “World-honored One! This monk Thera praises living alone, wandering alone, sitting alone.” The Buddha told the monks: “Summon this monk Thera.” Then one monk went to Thera’s place and said to him: “The World-honored One calls you!” Having received the summons, monk Thera went to the Buddha, paid homage at his feet, and stood to one side. The Buddha said to Thera: “Is it true that you live alone and praise sitting alone to practise the <i>Dhamma?”</i> Thera answered the Buddha: “It is true, World-honored One.” The Buddha said: “How, now, do you enjoy living alone, how do you praise it?” And Thera said: “World-honored One! Alone I enter the villages <span class="supplied">for the alms-round</span>, alone I leave them, alone I sit <span class="supplied">in meditation</span>.” The Buddha said to him: “There is a way of living alone, which is superior to yours.

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-11.2"></a>At that time the elder Saṅgāmaji had travelled to Sāvatthī from Kosala and gone to the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park. At that time Saṅgāmaji’s former wife learned that he had come to Sāvatthī. She got dressed, put on her jewelery, took their son with her and went to Saṅgāmaji’s place. When Saṅgāmaji came out to walk about in the open, she approached him and said: “Our son is too small to sustain himself, therefore I have come to see the venerable one.” Although he saw her, he did not speak with her. She addressed him a second and a third time, but though the Venerable Saṅgāmaji stood facing her, he did not look at her nor speak. His former wife then said to him: “I came to see you, but you will not speak with me. Here is your son, raise him yourself!” Placing the son in his father’s path, she left him there and went back. Some distance away she stopped and looked back. The venerable still did not speak to his son. There the former wife thought to herself: “This renunciant has well attained liberation, he has been able to cut off the fetter of attachment. The cutting off, which the seer <span class="supplied">the Buddha, has accomplished</span>, he too has attained completely.” Her wish unfulfilled, she went back, took the child, and carried him back home.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-11.3"></a>At that time the World-honored One, with his pure divine hearing surpassing human hearing, heard what Saṅgāmaji’s former wife had said and spoke this verse:</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-12.2"></a>At that time the Venerable Ānanda was in silent seclusion, when this thought came to him: “Once the World-honored One spoke about three kinds of scent: The scents of roots, stalks and blossoms; and about how there are no better scents than these. However <span class="supplied">he said</span> these three can <span class="supplied">only</span> be sensed with the wind, and cannot be sensed against the wind.” Having had this thought, Ānanda rose from his seat, went to the Buddha, and having paid homage at his feet stood to one side. He said to the Buddha: “World-honored One! Just now, while I was in silent seclusion, this thought came to me: ‘Once the World-honored One has spoken about three kinds of scent: The scents of roots, stalks and blossoms; and about how these are the best among all scents. However<span class="supplied">, he said,</span> these could <span class="supplied">only</span> be sensed with the wind and not against the wind.’ World-honored One, is there a scent that can be sensed both with and against the wind?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-12.3"></a>The Buddha said to Ānanda: “There is, there is. In this world there is a good scent that can be sensed both with and against the wind. And what scent? If there is, in a village or town, a man or woman who practices restraint, does not kill, does not steal, does not engage in sexual misconduct, does not lie, and does not drink alcohol, then all <i>deva</i>s and all those who have attained divine sight will praise this person. Thus, if in a town or village a man or a woman keeps the five precepts, the scent of the precepts is sensed with and against the wind.”</p>
<p>At that time the Buddha spoke this verse:</p>

<h1>Uruvela Kassapa performs miracles</h1>
</a></hgroup>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-13.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was wandering in Magadha accompanied by a thousand monks who had formerly been virtuous elders among the <i>brāhmaṇa</i>s, but who had attained Arahatship, stopped all defilements, ended all bonds of becoming <span class="supplied">that lead to rebirth</span>, done what was to be done, cast off the heavy burden, reaped their reward. The <i>Tathāgata</i> went to the Suppatiṭṭha <i>deva</i>-shrine in the Laṭṭhivana forest.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-13.2"></a>When king Bimbisāra heard that the Buddha was staying in the Laṭṭhivana he immediately set out with 18,000 cavalry, 12,000 palanquins and chariots, surrounded on all sides by a huge number of <i>brāhmaṇa</i>s and lay-men. When he arrived, he left the elephants, horses and chariots behind and took off his jewelry. On approaching the Buddha, he knelt and holding his hands with palms together <span class="supplied">in salutation</span> addressed the Buddha: “World-honored One! I am Bimbisāra, king of Magadha!” Three times he said this. The Buddha replied: “Very well, Bimbisāra, king of Magadha.” Bimbisāra paid homage to the Buddha’s feet and sat to one side and the <i>brāhmaṇa</i>s and elders of Magadha <span class="supplied">too</span> paid homage to the Buddha’s feet and one by one came before him and sat down. Sitting down, some raised their hands <span class="supplied">in greeting</span>, some sat down in silence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-13.3"></a>At that time Uruvela Kassapa was present and the people of Magadha began wondering: “Is the Buddha the teacher here, or Uruvela Kassapa?” The Buddha knew what the people of Magadha were thinking deep inside and he asked Kassapa with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-13.4"></a>“At Uruvela you /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>for a long time practiced the fire sacrifice;<br>
for what reason now /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>have you ceased, given up this practice?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Uruvela Kassapa answered with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-13.5"></a>“I once practiced fire sacrifice /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>desiring a taste of beauty<br>
and the objects of the five sensual pleasures. /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>However these are all impure,<br>
therefore I have given up /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>fire sacrifices, the way of offerings to fire.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the Buddha spoke another verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-13.6"></a>“We know you do not find happiness /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>in the five sensual pleasures, <span class="supplied">their</span> form and taste;<br>
what you do treasure now /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>make it known to men and gods.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-13.7"></a>And the venerable Uruvela Kassapa spoke another verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-13.8"></a>“Once I was ignorant /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>did not know the most true Dhamma,<br>
made fire offerings, practiced asceticism /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>and held this to be the cause of liberation.<br>
I was like someone born blind /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>not seeing the path to liberation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-13.9"></a>Now I have met the great dragon among men /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>who has taught me the correct view of the Dhamma.<br>
Now I have started to perceive /<br>

he leads sentient beings of every kind /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>so they may all perceive the light of wisdom.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the Buddha spoke another verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-13.11"></a>“Now you have well arrived /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>have obtained what you longed for,<br>

</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-13.13"></a>At this the venerable Uruvela Kassapa at once entered concentration and using his magical powers, rose up into the air, <span class="supplied">in various postures</span> sitting, then lying, then walking about.

Having displayed his magical powers in the east, he did the same in the south, the west and the north. When he was finished, he went before the Buddha, paid homage at his feet and said holding his hands with palms together <span class="supplied">in salutation</span>: “The great sage, the World-honored One is my teacher, from now on I am a student of the Buddha.” The Buddha said: “Very well, you shall learn from me, be my student.” And he ordered him: “Return to your seat now.”</p>

<h1>Mettiya and Mettiyā slander Dabba</h1>
</a></hgroup>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-14.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying in Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove of Kalanda.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-14.2"></a>At that time there was the monk Dabba Mallaputta. When the World-honored One put him in charge of provisions and lodgings, Dabba, having received the order, served as manager. One time, later, it was the turn of a monk called Mettiya to receive an invitation <span class="supplied">from a donor</span>, according to the order among the monks. According to the order among the monks, Dabba sent Mettiya to partake of the food at the donor’s place. When Mettiya went there, however, the food was extremely unpalatable. After this had happened three times, Mettiya felt extremely sorry for himself and consequently was greatly distressed. He told his sister, the nun Mettiyā: “Whenever Dabba sends me <span class="supplied">to a meal</span>, every time I get extremely unpalatable food! What misery!” And he said to the nun Mettiyā: “Sister, Dabba has afflicted me three times with bad food. Couldn’t you now use some “skillful means” to revenge my anger?” Mettiyā said: “But how could I help you?” The monk Mettiya: “I have a plan. Go to the Buddha and say: ‘Dabba once sexually harassed me.’ And I will bear witness and say: ‘It is true, it is true.’” The nun Mettiyā said: “But wouldn’t it be slander to accuse someone who has been pure in keeping the precepts?” Thereupon Mettiya said: “Sister! If you don’t do this for me, then from now on I won’t speak to you again any more.” The nun said: “If you insist, I will do as you say.” The monk Mettiya: “Sister, let me go first, you follow later.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-14.3"></a>Mettiya went to the Buddha and, having paid homage at his feet, sat to one side. Then the nun Mettiyā came to the Buddha and, having paid homage at his feet, stood to one side and said: “World-honored One! How comes it that Dabba Mallaputta has sexually harassed me?” And the monk Mettiya: “It is true! World-honored One!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-14.4"></a>At that time the monk Dabba was among those present. The Buddha asked him: “Did you hear this?” And Dabba answered: “World-honored One! The Buddha knows me.” The Buddha said: “In this case you cannot say it like this. If you have done it you should say: ‘I remember;’ if you have not done it, you should say: ‘I do not remember.’” He answered the Buddha: “World-honored One! I truly do not remember this.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-14.5"></a>Here Rāhula said: “World-honored One! This monk Dabba has sexually harassed the nun Mettiyā and the monk Mettiya has borne witness saying “I have seen how Dabba sexually harassed Mettiyā.” What <span class="supplied">else</span> is Dabba supposed to say?” The Buddha said to Rahula: “If you were slandered by the nun Mettiyā, if she were to say: ‘Rāhula has sexually harassed me’ and the monk Mettiya had also testified: ‘I have seen how Rāhula sexually harassed Mettiyā.’ What would you say?” Rāhula answered: “World-honored One! Slandered, I would only say: ‘The <i>Bhagavant</i> knows me, he himself is witness <span class="supplied">to my innocence</span>.’” The Buddha said: “Even you know this. How could Dabba, pure and innocent, fail to say it.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-14.6"></a>The Buddha told the monks: “You can recite the <i>Vinaya</i> together with Dabba. The nun Mettiyā has been undone by her own words.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-14.7"></a>The monks having received the Buddha’s order, sternly interrogated Mettiya: “Where did you see Dabba harassing Mettiyā? Did you alone see it, or were others with you?” When questioned in this way, Mettiya could not reply. Only then did he concede his slander: “When Dabba sent me to accept donors” invitations, three times I have received spoiled food! Out of greed, hatred and ignorance I have slandered him.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-14.8"></a>When <span class="supplied">later</span> the World-honored One emerged from his silent abode and sat on the prepared seat in front of the assembled monks, the monks told him: “World-honored One! We have recited the <i>Vinaya</i> with Dabba and expelled Mettiyā. Through interrogating Mettiya we have learned that Dabba was falsely accused.”</p>
<p>Then the Buddha spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-14.9"></a>“If all one has accomplished /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>is merely lies<br>

I do not hinder you.” Then the monk Dabba displayed the eighteen kinds of miraculous transformation. He rose up in the air, appeared in the east in all four postures, and turning various colours: green, yellow, red, white etc. One moment he appeared like water, then like a mass of fire. <span class="supplied">He made</span> his upper body emit water and his lower body fire, <span class="supplied">then he made</span> his upper body emit fire and his lower body water.

This happened three times, and the Buddha said: “This evil person will not harm me!” When he had entered the forest, Aṅgulimāla saw him coming from afar and, scabbard in the left hand, sword in the right, charged forward. But though he was running quickly and the Buddha calmly walked along, he could not catch him. When Aṅgulimāla became exhausted<i>,</i> he called to the Buddha: “Stop!

<h1>A deva tempts a monk and is granted an interview with the Buddha</h1>
</a></hgroup>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-17.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying in Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove of Kalanda.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-17.2"></a>At that time a monk, in the last light of the day, went to the riverbank, folded his clothes, put them aside and entered the river to bathe. He came naked out of the water and let his body dry on the riverside. There a <i>deva</i>, emitting rays and illuminating the riverbank, addressed him: “You have not long gone forth. Your body is strong and your hair is lovely. Why don’t you enjoy the five sensual pleasures? Haven’t you gone forth at the wrong time?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-17.3"></a>The monk answered: “I have gone forth at the right time, to attain the timeless.” The <i>deva</i> said: “What does it mean to ‘have gone forth at the right time, to attain the timeless’?” The monk replied: “The Buddha, the World-honored One, has explained how the five sensual pleasures are bound to time, the <i>Buddhadhamma</i>, however, is not bound to time. The five sensual pleasures bring very little pleasure, but multiply our sufferings, accumulate our worries. In the <i>Buddhadhamma</i> I have found certainty within this very body, with no more troubling passions. In everything we do, regardless of the time, when we sow even a little karmic seed, we will obtain the full fruit of its results.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-17.4"></a>Again the <i>deva</i> asked: “Why does the Buddha say the five sensual pleasures are bound to time, why does he say the <i>Buddhadhamma</i> is not bound to time?” The monk said: “I am still young and have not long gone forth. My learning is still shallow. How could I expound the wide and deep aspects of the utmost truth of the <i>Tathāgata</i>? The <i>Bhagavant</i> is staying near here in the Bamboo Grove of Kalanda. You can go and put your questions to him yourself.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-17.5"></a>The <i>deva</i> replied: “The Buddha is served by many powerful and virtuous <i>deva</i>s gathered around him left and right. I, weak and lowly as I am, will not be allowed to see him. Go and speak to the World-honored One on my behalf. If the <i>Tathāgata</i> out of compassion graciously agrees to listen, I will go and seek his counsel to dispel my doubts.” The monk: “Come along then, I will inform the World-honored One that you seek counsel.” The <i>deva</i> said: “I will follow you to the World-honored One.” There the monk went to where the Buddha was staying, and having paid homage at his feet, stood to one side and put the <i>deva’s</i> questions to the World-honored One.</p>
<p>There the World-honored One spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-17.6"></a>“Whoever says that the signs /<br>

</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-17.8"></a>The Buddha asked the <i>deva</i>: “Did you understand that?” The <i>deva</i> replied: “Not yet, World-honored One.” Then the Buddha spoke another verse:</p>

</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-17.10"></a>And the Buddha asked the <i>deva</i>: “Did you understand that?” The <i>deva</i> replied: “Not yet, World-honored One.” Then the Buddha spoke another verse:</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-17.11"></a>“By cutting off attachment to name-and-form /<br>

<h3>Bhikkhu Saṃyutta</h3>
<h1>The parable of the smoking burrow</h1>
</a></hgroup>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-18.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying in Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove of Kalanda.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-18.2"></a>At that time a monk went to the river in the early morning hours, undressed, and bathed. When he came out to dry his body on the riverside, there was a <i>deva</i> there, emitting rays and illuminating the riverbank. The <i>deva</i> addressed him <span class="supplied">with a riddle</span> saying: “Monk! There is a burrow, from which smoke arises at night, but which is ablaze with fire during the day. A <i>brāhmaṇa</i> having seen this, <span class="supplied">had it</span> broken open and dug up. There was a clever man <span class="supplied">doing the digging</span>, who told the <i>brāhmaṇa</i>: ‘Digging with the blade I found a tortoise’ And the <i>brāhmaṇa</i> said: ‘Bring this tortoise out!’ Again he said: ‘Digging up the ground I found a viper,’and <span class="supplied">the <i>brāhmaṇa</i></span> ordered him to catch it. Again he said: ‘Digging up the ground I found a piece of meat,’ and <span class="supplied">the <i>brāhmaṇa</i></span> ordered him to pull it out. Again he said: ‘Digging up the ground I found a slaughter-house.’ The <i>brāhmaṇa</i> said: ‘This is a slaughter-house’ and ordered him to take it out. Again he said: ‘Digging up the ground I found the <i>laṅgiman</i> poisonous insects,’ and <span class="supplied">the <i>brāhmaṇa</i></span> ordered him to dig them out. Again he said: ‘Digging up the ground I found a forked path,’ and <span class="supplied">the <i>brāhmaṇa</i> said:</span> ‘Out with it!’. Again he said: ‘Further digging up the ground I found a heap of stones’ and <span class="supplied">the <i>brāhmaṇa</i></span> ordered him to take out the stones. Again he said: ‘Digging up the ground I found a cobra.’ The <i>brāhmaṇa</i> said: ‘Do not disturb it’ and knelt before the cobra.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-18.3"></a>The <i>deva</i> said to the monk: “Don’t forget my words! Ask the Buddha <span class="supplied">about this</span> and remember all he says! Why? Because I see no-one, whether <i>deva</i>, demon, or <i>brahmā</i> with the ability to analyse this, no-one who could explain this riddle, but the Buddha and his disciples, the monks.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-18.4"></a>Then the monk went to the Buddha, paid homage at his feet and stood to one side. He told the Buddha what the <i>deva</i> had said <span class="supplied">and asked:</span> “World-honored One! What is this burrow that emits smoke at night and is on fire at day? Who is the <i>brāhmaṇa</i>? Who is the clever person? What is the blade? What does it mean ‘to dig’? What is the tortoise? What is the viper? What the piece of meat? What the slaughter-house? What the <i>laṅgiman</i> poisonous insects? What the forked path? What the heap of stones? What is the cobra?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-18.5"></a>The Buddha replied: “Listen carefully! Listen carefully! I will tell you. The burrow is the body. Conceived through the essences of father and mother, made up from the four elements, sustained by clothing and food: by these a body comes to be. But in the end the body will fail, swell up, become worm-eaten and break up. The smoke that arises at night is the various kinds of thoughts. The fire of the day is the karma engendered by body and speech. The <i>brāhmaṇa</i> is the <i>Tathāgata</i>. The clever man is the disciple (<i>sāvaka</i>). The blade is a metaphor for wisdom, and digging means diligent effort. The tortoise stands for the five hindrances, the viper for hatred and harming. The piece of meat means stinginess, greed and jealousy. The slaughter-house is the five sensual pleasures. The <i>laṅgiman</i> poisonous insects are a metaphor for ignorance, and the forked path stands for doubt. The stones are for arrogance, and the cobra is the <i>Arahat</i>, who has ended all bonds of becoming <span class="supplied">that lead to rebirth</span>.”</p>
<p>Then the Buddha spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-18.6"></a>“A burrow is the body /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>coarse and subtle thought is the smoke,<br>
deeds are like the fire /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>the brāhmaṇa is the <i>Tathāgata</i>,<br>

To answer these questions well /<br>

You are planting the seeds of suffering, extremely vulgar and defiled, your senses stained with evil. Where there are juice stains, flies are bound to gather.” At that time the monk heard what the Buddha said and understood that the Buddha, the World-honored One, had read his thoughts. Fear arose in him and he hurried away, his hairs standing on end.</p>

When he came out again he took his seat in front of the assembled monks. The Buddha addressed them: “Today, when I went into the town on my alms-round, I saw a monk next to a <i>deva</i> shrine, his thoughts filled with evil, his mind desiring sensuality. So I said: “Monk, monk! You are planting seeds of suffering, extremely vulgar and defiled, your senses stained with evil.

What is called ‘the seeds of suffering,’ what is ‘vulgar and defiled,’ what is ‘stained with evil,’ what is meant with ‘flies gathering?’” The Buddha answered: “Listen carefully, listen carefully! I will explain this: Anger and hatred is called ‘to plant seeds of suffering,’ the mind indulging in the five sensual pleasures is called ‘vulgar and defiled.’ When the six senses are not controlled in moral practice, this is called ‘stained with evil.’ That which causes the persistence of affliction and the arising of ignorance, arrogance, brazenness and shamelessness; that which causes the arising of the fetters is called ‘flies gathering.’”</p>

<h1>A monk makes an untimely visit to a village</h1>
<h4>Parable of the elephant and the lotus roots</h4>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-22.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-22.2"></a>At that time a large group of monks put on their robes, took their begging-bowls and entered the town to beg for food. There was a young, newly ordained monk who entered the village at an inappropriate time. The monks noticed this young, newly ordained monk in several places and said to him: “You have just begun training and do not yet know the discipline. What are you doing among the families?” The newly ordained monk said to the other monks: “The venerable Elders all visit the families. Why should I be denied this and not visit the families?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-22.3"></a>Then the monks, having eaten what they had received on their alms-round, put away their robes and begging-bowls, washed their feet, and went to the Buddha. Having paid homage at his feet, they sat to one side and said. Then they said to the Buddha: “World-honored One! When we entered the town to beg for food, we saw a young, newly ordained monk, who did not visit the families at the appropriate time. We said to him: ‘You have just begun training and do not yet know the discipline. Why do you visit the families at an inappropriate time?’ He answered us: ‘The elder monks as well have come to the families. Why should I alone be denied this?’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-22.4"></a>At that time the Buddha said to the monks: “In a vast wilderness there was a large lake. A number of full-grown elephants used to enter the lake and with their trunks pull out the lotus roots that were growing there. After giving them a shake, they cleaned them in the water and ate them. Their bodies became fat and full, and they grew extremely strong. Some juvenile elephants also ate of the lotus roots, but did not know how to shake them and clean them in the water. They ate them together with the mud and became weak and thin, they did not grow strong. Some died, some almost died.”</p>
<p>At that time the World-honored One spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-22.5"></a>“When full-grown elephants enter a lake /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>and pull out lotus roots with their trunks,<br>
they shake them and wash off the mud /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>and only then eat them.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-22.6"></a>Those monks who /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>practice the unsullied <i>Dhamma</i>,<br>
when receiving alms /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>are not tainted by any fault.<br>
Them I call practitioners /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>who are like the full-grown elephants.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-22.7"></a><span class="supplied">Those</span> who do not well understand skillful means /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>suffer later for their faults,<br>
they suffer later pain and distress /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>like the juvenile elephants.”</p>
