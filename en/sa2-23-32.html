<h3>Māra Saṃyutta</h3>
<h1>Māra disturbs a teaching on impermanence</h1>
</a></hgroup>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-23.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying <span class="insertion">north of</span> Rājagaha in the Sītavana forest. At that time the Buddha told the monks: “Human life is short, it is bound to end. You should make an effort to follow the path and practice in purity and celibacy. Therefore do not be lazy; practice right conduct. You should train yourselves in the <span class="insertion">right</span> meaning of the <i>Dhamma</i> and true conduct.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-23.2"></a>At that time the Demon King Māra, having heard what was said, thought: “The renunciant Gotama is expounding the principles of the <i>Dhamma</i> for his disciples in the Sītavana forest at Rājagaha. I should go there and disturb them.” Having thought thus, he transformed himself into a young man and went to the Buddha. He paid homage at his feet and stood to one side. Then he spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-23.3"></a>“Human life is long /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>without any cares or worries.<br>
<span class="insertion">For those</span> always at ease /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>there is no path for death.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-23.4"></a>The Buddha thought: “Māra the Bad has come to confuse and disturb us.” And he spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-23.5"></a>“Human life hurries quickly away /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>filled with confusion and trouble;<br>
make haste to practice the good /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>as if your head were on fire,<br>
and know the Bad One /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>has come to disturb.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-23.6"></a>Then King Māra, having heard the verse, thought: “The renunciant Gotama knows my intentions.” And he became depressed and dispirited and felt deep regret. He made himself invisible and returned to his heavenly palace.</p>

You should make haste and leave the realms <span class="insertion">of <i>saṃsāric</i> existence</span> to follow the path of liberation.” At that time the Demon King Māra, having heard what was said, thought: “The renunciant Gotama is expounding such a <i>Dhamma</i> for his disciples in the Sītavana forest at Rājagaha.

</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-25.3"></a>The Buddha thought: “Māra has come to disturb me,” and spoke a verse:</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-30.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on Vebhāra Mountain, in the Sattapaṇṇi Cave.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-30.2"></a>At that time, there was a monk called Godhika who lived alone in a cave on Isigili mountain, at the Black Rock. Living in the wilderness, he made diligent efforts, and through his tenacity cut through the view of self and attained temporary liberation, having experienced <span class="insertion">all</span> stages of <i>jhāna</i> meditation. Then he regressed and lost <span class="insertion">the experience of liberation</span>. <span class="insertion">This happened</span> a second time, a third time … altogether six times. Always he regressed. Then the monk thought: “Now, living alone and making diligent efforts, I have regressed six times. If I regress again, I will kill myself with a knife.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-30.3"></a>King Māra the Bad knew that the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on Gijjhakūṭa Mountain in the Sattapaṇṇi Cave. He also knew that a disciple of the Buddha called Godhika was staying near Rājagaha, on Isigili Mountain, at the Black Rock. There, making diligent efforts with tenacious mind, Godhika had attained temporary liberation, had personally witnessed <span class="insertion">the truth</span>, but after each of the six attainments had regressed. At that time King Māra had this thought: “When the monk Godhika attains <span class="insertion">temporary liberation</span> for the seventh time, he will certainly kill himself, and leave the world of Māra.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-30.4"></a>Having thought thus, he took his harp of beryl and went before the Buddha. Plucking his harp he composed this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-30.5"></a>“You endowed with great wisdom and great strength /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>with great magical powers,<br>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-30.6"></a>Now your <i>sāvaka</i> disciple /<br>

You, best among men /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>should restrain him.<br>
How could he who rejoices in your teaching /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>die while still learning it?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-30.7"></a>When King Māra had spoken this verse, the Buddha said to him: “Bad One, you have always been a great friend of the slothful. What you said just now was spoken for your own sake, not for the sake of that monk.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-30.8"></a>At that time the World-honored One spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-30.10"></a><span class="insertion">Godhika</span> has ended the propensity for lust and desire /<br>

<span class="insertion">He</span> has now cast off his final body /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span><span class="insertion">and</span> entered <i>Nirvāṇa</i> forever.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-30.11"></a>There King Māra became sad and dispirited, dropped his harp of beryl and sadly and regretfully returned to his palace.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-30.12"></a>The Buddha ordered the monks to <span class="insertion">follow him to</span> Godhika’s place at Isigili. <span class="insertion">There</span> they saw something like smoke gathering to the east of Godhika’s corpse. The Buddha said to the monks: “Do you see the smoke gathering?” The monks said: “Yes, World-honored One, we see it.” <span class="insertion">Then the smoke</span> gathered likewise towards the south, the west and the north <span class="insertion">of Godhika’s body</span>. The Buddha said to the monks: “This is the Bad One; his form is hidden and he is surrounding Godhika looking for his consciousness.” The Buddha said to the monks: “The monk Godhika has entered <i>Nirvāṇa</i>; there is no consciousness <span class="insertion">to be found</span>; there is no destination.” At that time, King Māra changed into a young man and spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-30.13"></a>“Above and below and in the four directions /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>I have searched for Godhika’s consciousness.<br>
Does no one know his destination /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>where his consciousness abides?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-30.14"></a>At that time the Buddha said to the Bad One: “Thus the wise and steadfast one has vanquished your armies and entered <i>Nirvāṇa</i>.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-30.15"></a>When the Buddha had finished speaking, the monks, having heard what he said, were happy and remembered it well.</p>

<span class="indent">​</span>and do not desire status and profit,<br>
why do you not with others /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>form close friendships?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.4"></a>At that time the World-honored One answered with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.5"></a>“For a long time I have attained meditative concentration /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>where the mind is always still.<br>
I have defeated your armies of desire /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span><span class="insertion">and</span> attained the highest fortune.<br>
My senses are always quiet and happy /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>In my mind I have attained silent extinction.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.6"></a>Defeating your armies of desire /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>practicing the way I feel joy,<br>
<span class="insertion">I live</span> alone, apart from the hustle and bustle <span class="insertion">of others</span> /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>What use have I for close friends?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At that time King Māra spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.7"></a>“Now, since you have attained the true way /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>you can rest in <i>Nirvāṇa</i>.<br>
Since you have reached the wonderful <i>Dhamma</i> /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>you should keep it forever in your bosom.<br>
Uprightly face and understand it alone; /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>why should you teach the manyfolk?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.8"></a>At that time the World-honored One answered with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.9"></a>“Humankind does not belong to you. /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>If someone asks me about the teaching that leads to the other shore,<br>
I will correctly explain /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>the truth to let them attain extinction.<br>
Stopping their mind without giving up; /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>Māra will not overpower them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At that time King Māra spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.10"></a>“It is as if there were a largewhite boulder /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>its color like that of fat.<br>
A flock of crows cannot distinguish <span class="insertion">the two</span> /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>they perch on it and peck away,<br>
but do not get the taste <span class="insertion">they wanted</span> /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>and with bruised beaks take off again into the air.<br>
I myself am like this /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>having come in vain, there is nothing more to do.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.11"></a>Then King Māra, having spoken this verse, became depressed and dispirited and felt deep regret. He went to an empty place where he crouched alone and, drawing <span class="insertion">figures</span> on the ground with an arrow, tried to think of a way <span class="insertion">to prevent the Buddha from teaching</span>. Māra had three daughters; the first was called Desire, the second Passion, and the third Pleasure<i>.</i> Māra’s daughters came to his side and addressed their father with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.12"></a>“Father, you are called “Great Lord,” /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>why are you so depressed?<br>
We will with the snare of desire /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>bind him <span class="insertion">the Buddha</span> as one catches a bird,<br>
and bring him to you, father, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>to make you feel at ease.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>King Māra answered with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.13"></a>“This man is good in cutting off desire /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>he is not moved by it.<br>
He has left the world of Māra already /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>this is why I am sad.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.14"></a>Then, Māra’s three daughters changed their appearance, becoming extraordinarily beautiful. They went to the Buddha, paid homage to his feet and sat to one side. The three daughters said together with one voice: “We have come to worship you and be at your service.” But the World-honored One <span class="insertion">had already attained</span> the final cutting-off of desires and did not even look at them. They addressed him like this a second and a third time. The Buddha did not look at them. Then, Māra’s three daughters retreated and discussed the matter: “It is in the nature of men that they like different types <span class="insertion">of women</span>. Some like <span class="insertion">their women</span> young, some like them middle-aged and some mature.” Upon <span class="insertion">saying</span> that, each daughter changed into six hundred women, some of them small girls, some teenagers, some of them already married women, and some not yet married, some of them had given birth already and some had not yet given birth. Having thus transformed themselves into a multitude of women, they all went to the Buddha and said to him: “World-honored One! We have come to worship the World-honored One and be at his service. We will serve <span class="insertion">the World-honored One</span> in every way.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.15"></a>The Buddha did not look at them. They addressed him like this a second and a third time. The Buddha did not look at them at all. Then, Māra’s daughters retreated and conferred again: “He must have attained the final cutting-off of desire, the supreme liberation. Otherwise he would have looked at us and become mad, spitting blood. It might even have torn his heart apart. Let us go to him and debate with him in verse.”</p>
<p>Māra’s daughter Desire asked in a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.16"></a>“The body upright, one hand cupped within another, you sit under the tree /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>alone in complete solitude, contemplating.<br>
Like someone who has lost a fortune /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>and desires to find a great treasure.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.17"></a>In the cities and villages /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>your mind is without passion or attachment.<br>
Why is it that among all those people /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>you have made no close friends?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.18"></a>At that time the World-honored One answered in a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.19"></a>“I have already attained the great treasure /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>attained quiet extinction in the mind.<br>
I have destroyed the host of passion and desire /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>am not attached to wonderful forms.<br>
I dwell alone sitting in meditation /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>experiencing the ultimate joy.<br>
For this reason /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>I do not desire close friends.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Māra’s daughter Passion spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.20"></a>“Dwelling in which state, oh monk, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>have you crossed the five currents <span class="insertion">of sense-pleasures</span>,<br>
as well as the sixth <span class="insertion">i.e. The mind</span> /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>in what meditation do you abide?<br>
That you attained the crossing from the shore of great desire /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>forever free from the bondage of becoming?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At that time the World-honored One spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.21"></a>“The body has obtained subtle, gentle joy /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>the mind has attained good liberation.<br>
The mind abstains from action /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>consciousness will never again regress.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.22"></a>Having attained the method of cutting off discursive thought /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>having achieved total abandoning of hatred and desire;<br>
if one can abide in this state /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span><span class="insertion">one</span> can cross the five currents,<br>
and the sixth as well /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>If one can sit in meditation like this,<br>
one can cross from the great fetter of desire /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>and leave the relentless flow of becoming.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Māra’s daughter Pleasure said in a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.23"></a>“Having cut off the fetter of desire /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>having abandoned what most people are attached to,<br>
crossing over the currents of many desires /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>crossing from the fatal shore of many desires;<br>
only the wise /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>can cross against these difficulties.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.24"></a>At that time the World-honored One spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.25"></a>“By great effort the <i>Tathāgata</i> extracts himself /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span><span class="insertion">and</span> crosses with the help of the true <i>Dhamma</i>.<br>
Liberated by the <i>Dhamma</i> /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>the wise have no reason to be unhappy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.26"></a>The three daughters, their wish unfulfilled, returned to their father. King Māra scolded them by speaking a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.27"></a>“My three daughters, you thought you could destroy him /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>with your appearance <span class="insertion">stunning</span> as lightning.<br>
Advancing on the <span class="insertion">one of</span>great energy /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span><span class="insertion">you were scattered by him</span> like tufts of grass in the wind;</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.28"></a><span class="insertion">You acted as if you could</span> tear down a mountain with your fingernails /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>and bite through iron pellets with your teeth;<br>
foolish children <span class="insertion">trying</span> with lotus fibers/ to suspend a great mountain.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.29"></a>The Buddha has already crossed beyond all attachment /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>desiring to argue with him<br>
<span class="insertion">is like wanting to</span> catch the wind with a net /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>like wanting to take down the moon from the sky,<br>
<span class="insertion">or like wanting</span> to scoop the ocean with one’s hands /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>in the hope of bailing it dry.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.30"></a>The Buddha has already left all attachment behind; /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>desiring to go and argue with him<br>
<span class="insertion">is like</span> lifting one’s foot to stride over Mount Sumeru /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span><span class="insertion">or</span> to find solid earth <span class="insertion">to step on</span> in the great ocean.<br>
The Buddha has already abandoned all attachment, /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>yet you go and argue with him!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-31.31"></a>King Māra, sad and regretful, vanished and returned to his heavenly palace.</p>

</a></hgroup>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-32.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on Gijjhakūṭa Mountain. At that time the Buddha was extolling the teaching of <i>Nirvāṇa</i> for the monks. King Māra thought: “The Buddha is staying near Rājagaha extolling the teaching of <i>Nirvāṇa</i> for the monks. I should go and disturb them.” Having thought this, he changed into a hundred people, of whom fifty were extremely beautiful and fifty extremely ugly. At that time the monks were all surprised and astonished. “What is happening now? Such beauty, and again, such ugliness?” The Buddha knew that Māra had come to disturb the gathering. At that time the World-honored One addressed the Bad one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-32.2"></a>‘In the long night of <span class="insertion"><i>saṃsāric</i></span> birth and rebirth,<br>
<span class="indent">​</span> you assume all these forms, beautiful and ugly.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-32.3"></a>How now do you attain deliverance from the shore of suffering?<br>
<span class="indent">​</span> What is the use of all these shape-changes?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-32.4"></a>If someone is attached to <span class="insertion">the characteristics of a</span> man or woman,<br>
<span class="indent">​</span> you might <span class="insertion">with benefit</span>change into these forms.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-32.5"></a>I, however, do not <span class="insertion">give significance to</span> the characteristics of a man or woman.<br>
<span class="indent">​</span> What use is it changing into these shapes?’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa2-32.6"></a>When the Buddha had finished, the monks, having listened to what he had said, were happy and practiced accordingly.</p>
