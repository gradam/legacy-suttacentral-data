<h1>Somā</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.215.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.215.2"></a>At that time the nun Somā took her robes and her begging bowl and entered Sāvatthī to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she cleaned her bowl, gathered her seat <span class="supplied">for meditation</span> and went to the Andhavana forest <span class="supplied">to meditate</span>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.215.3"></a>King Māra the Bad thought: “The nun Somā took her robes and her begging bowl and entered Sāvatthī to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she has cleaned her bowl, and gathered her seat <span class="supplied">for meditation</span> and is now on her way to the Andhavana forest <span class="supplied">to meditate</span>.” Thereupon the Bad One transformed himself into a <i>brāhmaṇa</i>, stood by the wayside, and said: “My lady, where are you going?” The nun answered: “I am going to a secluded place.” Then the Bad One spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.215.4"></a>“The stage which seers attain, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>that state is difficult to reach.<br>
With your inferior intelligence /<br><span class="indent">​</span>you cannot attain that state.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.215.5"></a>Thereupon the nun thought: “Is this a human or a non-human being, who wants to disturb me?” She entered <span class="supplied">a state of meditative</span> concentration and, using her insight, she recognized that it was the Bad One. She spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.215.6"></a>“The mark of womanhood has nothing to do with it /<br><span class="indent">​</span>if only the mind practices meditative concentration<br>
And perceives the highest <i>Dhamma</i>; /<br><span class="indent">​</span>as long as there are the marks of man—and womanhood,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.215.7"></a>One can say that women /<br><span class="indent">​</span>are not apt for the <i>Dhamma.</i><br>
Once the marks of man—and womanhood are no more /<br><span class="indent">​</span>from where should distinctions arise?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.215.8"></a><span class="supplied">I have</span> cut off all craving, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the darkness of ignorance is destroyed.<br>
Having reached complete cessation, /<br><span class="indent">​</span><span class="supplied">I</span> dwell in a state of purity.<br>
Therefore understand: /<br><span class="indent">​</span>Bad One you are defeated.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.215.9"></a>At that time the Bad One thought: “The nun Somā knows my mind well!” Depressed, dispirited, and ashamed he returned to his palace.</p>
