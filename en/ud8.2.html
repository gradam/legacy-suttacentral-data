<h1>The Second Discourse about Nibbāna</h1>
</hgroup>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ud8.2.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta's Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Then at that time the Gracious One was instructing, rousing, enthusing, and cheering the monks with a Dhamma talk connected with Emancipation. Those monks, after making it their goal, applying their minds, considering it with all their mind, were listening to Dhamma with an attentive ear.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ud8.2.2"></a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="verse">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ud8.2.3"></a>“What is called ‘the uninclined’ <span class="supplied">Emancipation</span> is hard to see,<br>
for it is not easy to see the truth,<br>
For the one who knows, who has penetrated craving,<br>
for the one who sees there is nothing <span class="supplied">no defilements</span>.”</p>
