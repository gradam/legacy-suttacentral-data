<h3>Bhikkhu Saṃyutta</h3>
<h1>The conversion of Aṅgulimāla</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was traveling in the Tao-he forest in Magadha.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.2"></a><span class="supplied">On his way there</span> he met a herdsman who said: “In this forest lives the bandit Aṅgulimāla, who might harm you.” The Buddha told the herdsman: “The bandit is unlikely to harm me,” and went along. He met another herdsman who told him the same and the Buddha answered as before. This happened three times, and the Buddha said: “This evil person will not harm me!” When he had entered the forest, Aṅgulimāla saw him coming from afar and, scabbard in the left hand, sword in the right, charged forward. But though he was running quickly and the Buddha calmly walked along, he could not catch him. When Aṅgulimāla became exhausted<i>,</i> he called to the Buddha: “Stop! Renunciant, stop!” The Buddha replied: “I have already stopped, it is you who have not stopped.”</p>
<p>Then Aṅgulimāla spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.3"></a>“This renunciant keeps on walking /<br><span class="indent">​</span>but says: ‘I have already stopped.’<br>
I now have stopped /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and he says I have not.<br>
Why does he say he has stopped /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and I have not?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the Buddha spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.4"></a>“For long have I abstained /<br><span class="indent">​</span>from treating others with violence.<br>
You trouble them /<br><span class="indent">​</span>persist in your evil ways.<br>
Therefore I say I have stopped /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and you have not.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.5"></a>I have abandoned causing, out of spite and evil /<br><span class="indent">​</span>harm to all endowed with form.<br>
It is you who do not cease your evil ways /<br><span class="indent">​</span>always doing unwholesome deeds.<br>
Therefore I say I have stopped /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and you have not.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.6"></a>I have abandoned all forms of harm /<br><span class="indent">​</span>towards living beings.<br>
You harm the living /<br><span class="indent">​</span>have not abandoned the dark deeds.<br>
Therefore I say I have stopped /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and you have not.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.7"></a>I enjoy my state /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the mind concentrated tirelessly.<br>
You do not see the four truths /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and nowhere do you stop.<br>
Therefore I say I truly have stopped /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and you have not.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There Aṅgulimāla spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.8"></a>“Long have I dwelt in this wilderness /<br><span class="indent">​</span>never have I seen such a man;<br>
the Bhagavant has come here /<br><span class="indent">​</span>to teach me the good <i>Dhamma</i>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.9"></a>Long have I followed evil ways /<br><span class="indent">​</span>today I will abandon them.<br>
Now that I have heard you speak /<br><span class="indent">​</span>I follow the <i>Dhamma</i> and cut off all evil.<br><br><span class="supplied">Having spoken thus he</span> sheathed the sword /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and cast it into a deep pit<br>
and bowed his head to pay homage /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and took refuge in the World-honored One.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.10"></a>Filled with deep faith /<br><span class="indent">​</span>he set his mind on going forth.<br>
Then the Buddha let compassion arise /<br><span class="indent">​</span>for the benefit of all <span class="supplied">beings in the</span> world<br>
invited him: ‘Come!’/ so he became a renunciant.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.11"></a>There Aṅgulimāla, a son of good family, shaved off his hair and beard, put on the robes and went forth. <span class="supplied">From then on</span> he he dwelt in empty, silent places, his mind striving tirelessly, focused on his practice, diligent in his efforts, by concentration he focused his mind in true insight. He practiced supreme abstinence, reached the end of suffering and attained realization within this present world, within his own very body. He clearly understood his nature. He knew: for me birth is ended, the holy abode is established, done is what had to be done, there will be no further rebirth <span class="supplied">for me</span>. When the venerable Ahiṃsaka became an <i>Arahat</i> and attained the joy of liberation he spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.12"></a>“My name is Ahiṃsaka <span class="supplied">one who does no harm</span> /<br><span class="indent">​</span>but later I committed great cruelties.<br>
Now however my name has come true /<br><span class="indent">​</span>truth is not to harm.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.13"></a>Now I abstain from doing harm with body /<br><span class="indent">​</span>speech and mind.<br>
Who never harms others /<br><span class="indent">​</span>is truly called Ahiṃsaka.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.14"></a>I was steeped in blood /<br><span class="indent">​</span>so they called me Aṅgulimāla.<br><span class="supplied">I was like one</span> carried away by a strong current. /<br><span class="indent">​</span>Therefore I have taken refuge in the Buddha.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.15"></a>I received ordination /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and attained the three knowledges;<br>
fully understanding the teachings of the Buddha /<br><span class="indent">​</span>I respect and practice it.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.16"></a>In this world, <span class="supplied">usually,</span> those who tame /<br><span class="indent">​</span>or control, do so with violence,<br>
with iron hooks and whips and bridles /<br><span class="indent">​</span>dealing out cuffs and blows.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.17"></a>The World-honored One, the great tamer /<br><span class="indent">​</span>has done away with evil methods,<br>
has abandoned violence. /<br><span class="indent">​</span>This is the true way of taming.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.18"></a>To cross water, one needs a bridge or a boat; /<br><span class="indent">​</span>to straighten arrows, one needs a fire;<br>
the carpenter needs an adze, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the wise develop themselves by wisdom.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.19"></a>A person who at first committed evil /<br><span class="indent">​</span>then stops, doing so no more:<br>
he shines upon the world /<br><span class="indent">​</span>like the moon when the clouds have disappeared.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.20"></a>A person who was slothful at first /<br><span class="indent">​</span>then stops being lazy:<br>
whole-heartedly he abandons thorns and poison /<br><span class="indent">​</span>focusing on crossing to the other shore.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.21"></a>Once evil deeds are done /<br><span class="indent">​</span>one is bound to be reborn in evil realms.<br>
Meeting the Buddha purged my guilt /<br><span class="indent">​</span>I escaped <span class="supplied">the fruit of</span> my evil actions.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.16.22"></a>All those who grasp what I say /<br><span class="indent">​</span>will liberate their minds from the bonds of hatred,<br>
through patience will attain pure vision. /<br><span class="indent">​</span>Victory without fighting is the teaching of the Buddha.”</p>
