<h3>Sakka Saṃyutta</h3>
<h1>Nestlings</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.49.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.49.2"></a>At that time the World-honored One said to the monks: “Once, long ago, Sakka did battle with the <i>asura</i>s. At that time the <i>deva</i>s were inferior and the <i>asura</i>s were winning. Sakka, having seen <span class="supplied">that the <i>deva</i>s were</span> inferior, had his charioteer turn around, and wanted to return to his heavenly palace. On the way he noticed a withered <i>sāla</i> tree, where a <i>suparṇa</i> bird had built its nest. Sakka said to his charioteer Mātali: ‘In this nest there are two bird’s eggs. Let’s avoid damaging them. Make a turn and avoid that tree.’ Sakka addressed Mātali in verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.49.3"></a>“Do you see the nest in this tree? /<br><span class="indent">​</span>It contains two eggs.<br>
If the chariot continues its course /<br><span class="indent">​</span>it will strike the tree and break the eggs.<br>
I would rather throw my body /<br><span class="indent">​</span>against the host of the asuras<br>
and lose my life /<br><span class="indent">​</span>than harm these eggs.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.49.4"></a>Having spoken this verse, he promptly turned the chariot. When the <i>asura</i>s saw Sakka turning around, they all became afraid and said: ‘Sakka was just faking a retreat! Now that he has turned, he will certainly destroy our army!’ Then the <i>asura</i>s were routed and the <i>deva</i>s pursued them all the way back to their city.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.49.5"></a>The Buddha told the monks: “Sakka Devānaṃ Inda dwells as king among the gods. Just as he is always practicing loving-kindness and patience, so you, monks, should train yourselves likewise.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa-2.49.6"></a>The monks heard what the Buddha said, were happy and remembered it well.</p>
