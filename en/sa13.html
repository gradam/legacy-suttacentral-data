<h1 class="supplied">First Discourse on Gratification</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa13.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the Blessed One said to the monks:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa13.2"></a>“If living beings did not find gratification in form, they would not get defiled by form. Because living beings find gratification in form, they are defiled <span class="supplied">by form</span> and attached <span class="supplied">to it</span>. In the same way, if living beings did not find gratification in feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, they would not get defiled by consciousness. Because living beings find gratification in feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, they are defiled by consciousness and attached <span class="supplied">to it</span>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa13.3"></a>“Monks, if living beings did not experience the danger in form, those living beings would not become disenchanted with form. Because living beings <span class="supplied">experience</span> the danger in form, those living beings become disenchanted with form. In the same way, if they did not experience the danger in feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, those living beings would not become disenchanted with consciousness. Because living beings <span class="supplied">experience</span> the danger in feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, those living beings become disenchanted with consciousness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa13.4"></a>“Monks, if for living beings there were no escape from form, those living beings would not escape from form. Because for living beings there is an escape from form, those living beings escape from form. In the same way, if for living beings there were no escape from feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, those living beings would not escape from consciousness. Because for living beings there is an escape from feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, those living beings escape from consciousness.<a class="t" id="t2c"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa13.5"></a>“Monks, as <span class="supplied">long as</span> I had not understood as it really is the gratification in relation to the five aggregates of clinging as gratification, the danger as danger and the escape as escape, among gods, Māra, Brahmā, recluses, brahmins and the assemblies of gods and men I was not liberated, had not gone beyond, was not released, was forever dwelling in <span class="supplied">mental</span> distortion and was unable to declare of myself to have attained supreme and right awakening.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa13.6"></a>“Monks, because I had understood as it really is the gratification in relation to the five aggregates of clinging as gratification, the danger as danger and the escape as escape, among gods, Māra, Brahmā, recluses, brahmins and the assemblies of gods and men I was able to declare to have attained liberation, to have attained the going beyond, to have attained escape and to have attained liberation from the fetters, to be forever not dwelling in <span class="supplied">mental</span> distortion and I was able to declare of myself to have attained supreme and right awakening.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa13.7"></a>Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
