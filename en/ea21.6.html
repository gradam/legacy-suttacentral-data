</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="ea21.6.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then the Exalted One said to the bhikṣus:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="ea21.6.2"></a>“If a bhikṣu is possessed of three qualities (<i lang="pi">dharma</i>), he will well experience happiness in this life (<i lang="pi">dṛṣṭe dharme</i>) and realise, through great perseverance and energy, the end of the existential constituents under the sway of the malign influences (<i lang="pi">sāsravadharma</i>). Which are the three? There is a bhikṣu who a) is composed (<i lang="pi">samāhita</i>) with respect to the sense faculties (<i lang="pi">indriya</i>), b) moderate in eating and c) who does not neglect his walking exercises (<i lang="pi">caṅkrama</i>).</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="ea21.6.3"></a>“How is a bhikṣu composed with respect to the sense faculties? In this regard, when seeing a form with the eye, he neither starts indulging in notions (<i lang="pi">samjñā</i>) <span class="supplied">concerning that form</span> nor does he recall <span class="supplied">any notions</span>. <span class="supplied">Thus, by seeing with perfect mindfulness,</span> he realises purification (<i lang="pi">viśuddhi</i>) regarding the faculty of the eye. By means <span class="supplied">of achievement</span> he aspires to <span class="supplied">ultimate</span> freedom (<i lang="pi">vimukti</i>), always guarding the faculty of the eye.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="ea21.6.4"></a>“When hearing a sound with the ear, smelling a scent with the nose, recognising a flavour with the tongue, feeling tangibles with the body, or being aware of mental objects with his mind, he neither starts indulging in notions nor does he recall <span class="supplied">any notions</span>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="ea21.6.5"></a>“<span class="supplied">Thus, by … being aware with perfect mindfulness,</span> he realises purification regarding the faculty of … the mind, and by means <span class="supplied">of this achievement</span> he aspires to <span class="supplied">ultimate</span> freedom, always guarding the faculty of … the mind.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="ea21.6.6"></a>“Thus a bhikṣu is composed with regard to the sense faculties.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="ea21.6.7"></a>“How is a bhikṣu moderate in eating? In this regard <span class="supplied">he takes his food,</span> thinking where it has come from, and not in order to become plump (<i lang="pi">sthūla</i>) and beautiful (<i lang="pi">gaura</i>). <span class="supplied">He eats</span> only with a view to supporting<a class="t" id="tT2_604a"></a> the body and keeping the four physical elements (<i lang="pi">caturmahābhūta</i>) in shape (<i lang="pi">sakala</i>), <span class="supplied">reflecting:</span> ‘Now I should check former pangs <span class="supplied">of hunger</span> and prevent new ones from arising, letting the body have <span class="supplied">enough</span> strength to practice the <span class="supplied">Noble</span> Path and lest the holy life (<i lang="pi">brahmacarya</i>) be impeded.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="ea21.6.8"></a>“<span class="supplied">Take</span> for example a bad abscess that has developed on a man’s or woman’s body. Someone applies a salve to that abscess, and his <span class="supplied">salve</span> is applied for the <span class="supplied">sole</span> purpose of occasioning a cure.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="ea21.6.9"></a>“Similarly, O bhikṣus, a bhikṣu is moderate in eating, thinking where the food <span class="supplied">that he is taking</span> has come from; he does not <span class="supplied">take it</span> in order to become stout … and <span class="supplied">he eats</span> only with a view to supporting the body … lest the holy life be impeded.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="ea21.6.10"></a>“<span class="supplied">Take again</span> for example a cart <span class="supplied">carrying</span> heavy loads. Its wheels are greased for the <span class="supplied">sole</span> purpose of delivering heavy <span class="supplied">loads</span> at their destinations.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="ea21.6.11"></a>“Similarly, a bhikṣu is moderate in eating, thinking … he does not <span class="supplied">take food</span> in order to become stout … Thus a bhikṣu is moderate in eating.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="ea21.6.12"></a>“How does a bhikṣu not neglect his walking-exercises? In this regard, in the first and last <span class="supplied">watches of</span> the night he diligently and mindfully takes his walking-exercises without being mistaken about the periods <span class="supplied">of day and night</span>. Continually he directs his attention to making use of the aids to enlightenment (<i lang="pi">bodhipakṣa</i>).</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="ea21.6.13"></a>“During daytime, whether he is walking of sitting, he wisely reflects on the eminent Teaching (<i lang="pi">praṇītadharma</i>) <span class="supplied">and thus</span> rids himself of the hindrances (<i lang="pi">nivaraṇa</i>) diminishing <span class="supplied">all his efforts</span>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="ea21.6.14"></a>“Again, in the first <span class="supplied">watch of</span> the night, whether he is walking or sitting, he wisely reflects … and rids himself…; in the middle <span class="supplied">watch of</span> the night, lying on his right side, he directs his attention to waking up <span class="supplied">again</span>; in the last <span class="supplied">watch of</span> the night he rises <span class="supplied">and starts</span> walking; he wisely reflects on the profound Teaching, ridding himself of the hindrances diminishing <span class="supplied">his efforts</span>. Thus a bhikṣu does not neglect his walking-exercises.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="ea21.6.15"></a>“If a bhikṣu is composed with respect to the sense faculties, moderate in eating and if he does not neglect his walking-exercises, always mindful and directing his attention to making use of the aids to enlightenment, he will surely reap two results: in this life he will realise the <span class="supplied">state of</span> a non-returner (<i lang="pi">anāgāmin</i>).</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="ea21.6.16"></a>“Just as a skilled charioteer drives his chariot <span class="supplied">pulled</span> by four horses, keeping to the smooth surface of the middle of the road, and <span class="supplied">thus</span> definitely <span class="supplied">proceeds</span> without delay wherever he wishes to go; even so this bhikṣu will definitely <span class="supplied">reap excellent results</span>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="ea21.6.17"></a>“If he is composed … making use of the aids to enlightenment, he will surely reap two results: in this life he will be rid of the malign influences (<i lang="pi">kṣīnasrava</i>) and becomes a non-returner.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="ea21.6.18"></a>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the bhikṣus were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
