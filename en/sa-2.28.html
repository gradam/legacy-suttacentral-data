<h3>Māra Saṃyutta</h3>
<h1>Māra transforms himself into a snake to frighten the Buddha</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.28.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on Gijjhakūṭa Mountain.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.28.2"></a>At that time, in the middle of the night, the World-honored One was practicing walking meditation in the open. Having washed his feet, he entered his silent abode, sat upright and focused his attention in front of him. Then, King Māra the Bad had this thought: “The renunciant Gotama <span class="supplied">staying</span> in Rājagaha on Gijjhakūṭa Mountain is practicing walking meditation in the open. I should go and disturb him.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.28.3"></a>At that time King Māra changed into a huge snake that was long and thick like a large boat. With a pair of eyes glittering brightly like a <span class="supplied">bronze</span> bowl from the land of Kosala, tongue flicking in and out like lightning and breath heaving like thunder, it stood before the Buddha and coiled its body around him. Then, it bent its neck forward, and lowered its head on to the head of the Buddha. The Buddha, who knew that this was Māra <span class="supplied">trying</span> to disturb him, spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.28.4"></a>“I live in complete solitude /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the mind focused in true liberation,<br>
in quiet meditation and physical cultivation /<br><span class="indent">​</span>according to the teaching of the former Buddhas.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.28.5"></a>Poisonous snakes, fierce and violent /<br><span class="indent">​</span>of terrifying appearance,<br>
constrictor snakes and vermin: /<br><span class="indent">​</span>all these disturbances /<br>
cannot stir even one hair <span class="supplied">on my body</span> /<br><span class="indent">​</span>much less frighten me.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.28.6"></a>If the sky broke apart /<br><span class="indent">​</span>or the great earth shook,<br>
all beings /<br><span class="indent">​</span>would feel great terror;<br><span class="supplied">but</span> to frighten me /<br><span class="indent">​</span>is not possible.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.28.7"></a>Even if you aimed a poisoned arrow /<br><span class="indent">​</span>at my heart,<br>
the moment the arrow struck /<br><span class="indent">​</span>I would not seek protection;<br>
nevertheless the poisoned arrow /<br><span class="indent">​</span>cannot penetrate.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sa-2.28.8"></a>When King Māra heard the Buddha speak this verse he thought: “The Gotama renunciant knows my mind!” and he became deeply afraid. Depressed and dispirited, he made himself invisible and returned to his heavenly palace.</p>
