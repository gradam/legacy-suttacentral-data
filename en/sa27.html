<h1 class="supplied">Discourse on Proceeding in the Dharma</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa27.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time a certain monk approached the Buddha, paid homage with his head at the <span class="supplied">Buddha’s</span> feet and withdrew to stand at one side. He said to the Buddha: “As the Blessed One has spoken about proceeding in the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma how does one proceed in the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa27.2"></a>The Buddha said to the monk: “It is well, it is well. You now wish to know how to proceed in the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma. Is it like this?” The monk said to the Buddha: “Indeed, Blessed One.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa27.3"></a>The Buddha said to the monk: “Listen and pay careful attention to what I will tell you. Monk, proceeding towards disenchantment in regard to form, towards being free from desire for it, towards its cessation, this is reckoned proceeding in the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma. In the same way proceeding towards disenchantment in regard to feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, towards being free from desire for it, towards its cessation, this is reckoned proceeding in the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa27.4"></a>Then that monk, hearing what the Buddha had said, was thrilled with delight, paid homage and left.</p>
