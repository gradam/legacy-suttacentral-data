</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then the Exalted One said to the bhikṣus:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“There are three bad practices. Which are the three?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Bad practices of body, speech and mind. These, O bhikṣus, are the three bad practices.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“One should aspire to skill in means to cultivate three good practices. Which are the three?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Somebody whose practice of body, speech and mind is bad, should cultivate good practice of body, speech, and mind.</p>
<p>Then the Exalted One uttered the following verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“One should guard against bad practice of body and<br>
Cultivate good practice of body; it <span class="supplied">should always</span> be<br>
Kept in mind to give up bad practice of body,<br>
And good practice of body should be learnt.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“One should guard against bad practice of speech and<br>
Cultivate good practice of speech; it <span class="supplied">should always</span> be<br>
Kept in mind to give up bad practice of speech,<br>
And good practice of speech should be learnt.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“One should guard against bad practice of mind and<br>
Cultivate good practice of mind; it <span class="supplied">should always</span> be<br>
Kept in mind to give up bad practice of mind,<br>
And good practice of mind should be learnt.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“<span class="supplied">Good</span> practice of body is excellent, and<br><span class="supplied">Good</span> practice of speech likewise, to be sure,<br><span class="supplied">Good</span> practice of mind is excellent, and the same<br>
Holds true of <span class="supplied">good practice</span> in every respect.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>“Restraint in speech, purity of mind and no bad practice<br>
Of body—by realising purity in these three practices<br>
One will reach the <span class="supplied">Great</span> Sage’s state of the Unconditioned (<i lang="pi">asaṃskṛtasthāna</i>).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>“Thus, bhikṣus, one should give up the three bad practices and cultivate the three good practices, and thus, O bhikṣus, you should train.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the bhikṣus were pleased … to practice.</p>
