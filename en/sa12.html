<h1 class="supplied">Second Discourse on Causes and Conditions</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa12.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the Blessed One said to the monks:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa12.2"></a>“Form is impermanent. The causes and conditions for the arising of any form are also impermanent. Any form that has arisen from impermanent causes and impermanent conditions, how could it be permanent?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa12.3"></a>“Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is impermanent. The causes and conditions for the arising of any consciousness are also impermanent. Any consciousness that has arisen from impermanent causes and impermanent conditions, how could it be permanent?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa12.4"></a>“In the same way, monks, form is impermanent, feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is impermanent, what is impermanent is <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>, what is <i lang="pi">dukkha</i> is not self, what is not self is not mine. One who contemplates like this is reckoned to be contemplating truly and rightly.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa12.5"></a>“A noble disciple who contemplates like this becomes liberated from form, liberated from feeling … perception … formations … consciousness. I say he becomes equally liberated from birth, old age, disease, death, worry, sorrow, pain and vexation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.sa12.6"></a>Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
