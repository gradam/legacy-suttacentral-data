<h1>The Discourse about Visākhā</h1>
</hgroup>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ud2.9.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, at the Eastern Monastery in Migāra's mother's mansion. Then at that time Migāra's mother Visākhā was bound up in some matter or other with the Kosalan King Pasenadi, <span class="supplied">but</span> the Kosalan King Pasenadi would not conclude it according to <span class="supplied">her</span> desire.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ud2.9.2"></a>Then Migāra's mother Visākhā in the middle of the day went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, she sat down on one side. While sat on one side the Gracious One said this to Migāra's mother Visākhā: “Well now, Visākhā, where have you come from in the middle of the day?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ud2.9.3"></a>“Here, reverend Sir, I am bound up in some affair or other with the Kosalan King Pasenadi, <span class="supplied">but</span> the Kosalan King Pasenadi does not conclude it according to <span class="supplied">my</span> desire.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ud2.9.4"></a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ud2.9.5"></a>“All that is in another's power is painful, all that is mastered is pleasing,<br>
What is shared is troubling, for yokes are difficult to transcend.”</p>
