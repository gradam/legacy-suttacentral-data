<h1>Ekottarāgama 20.4</h1>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea20.4.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then the Exalted One said to the bhikṣus:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea20.4.2"></a>“Now it is apposite for me to say <span class="insertion">the following</span>—there are persons who are like lions and those who are like sheep. Listen attentively and take heed (<i lang="pi">śṛṇuta ca suṣṭhu ca manasi-kuruta</i>) of what <span class="insertion">I am going to say</span>.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea20.4.3"></a>“We shall, Exalted One,” replied the bhikṣus. <span class="insertion">In order to</span> instruct them, the Exalted One went on:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea20.4.4"></a>“How does a person resemble a lion? There is<span class="insertion">, for example,</span> a bhikṣu, someone who receives what is respectfully offered (<i lang="pi">satkāra</i>): robes, alms-food (<i lang="pi">piṇḍapāta</i>), lodging (<i lang="pi">śayanāsana</i>) and medicine for treating the sick. Having received and then enjoying (<i lang="pi">pari-</i>√<i lang="pi">bhuj</i>) them, attachment does not arise in his mind; neither thoughts of desire arise in him nor any <span class="insertion">wrong</span> perception. Not <span class="insertion">entertaining</span> any <span class="insertion">wrong</span> ideas whatsoever, he is absolutely certain about the Teaching (<i lang="pi">dharma</i>) conducive to emancipation (<i lang="pi">nairyāṇika</i>). Even if he has to go without gains and favours (<i lang="pi">lābhasatkāra</i>), he is neither distracted (<i lang="pi">vikṣipta</i>) nor does he experience elation and dejection.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea20.4.5"></a>“<span class="insertion">He is</span> like the royal lion <span class="insertion">whenever the latter has</span> to make do with a small domestic animal <span class="insertion">as prey</span>. At that time the king of beasts, too, does not think like this: ‘This is good, that is bad.’ Attachment does not arise in his mind: neither thoughts of desire arise in him nor <span class="insertion">wrong</span> perception. Similar is <span class="insertion">the behaviour of</span> this person: Whenever he receives respectful offerings … attachment does not arise in his mind. Even if he does not receive anything, he does not entertain any <span class="insertion">wrong</span> ideas.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea20.4.6"></a>“Take for example someone who receives what people respectfully offer him: robes, alms-food, lodging, help and medicine for the sick. Having received and then enjoying them, attachment arises in his mind; thoughts of sensuous desire (<i lang="pi">kāmarāga</i>) arise in him and he is absolutely oblivious of the path leading to emancipation. Should he receive nothing, he does not stop fretting. Having received respectful offerings, however, he boasts of himself and insults the other bhikṣus <span class="insertion">by saying</span>: ‘It is me who is fit (<i lang="pi">samartha</i>) to receive robes … medicine for the sick, whereas these bhikṣus are not.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea20.4.7"></a>“<span class="insertion">Let us take</span> the simile of that single sheep in the midst of a large flock of sheep. Having separated itself from the flock, that sheep went to a large heap of dung. Having feasted on the faeces at a distance from the flock, it returned to it and, boasting of itself, <span class="insertion">it insulted the other sheep by saying</span>: ‘I am fit to receive excellent food, these sheep are not.’ Similarly, whenever the <span class="insertion">second type of</span> person receives gains and favours, robes … medicine for the sick, he loses his composure and attachment arises in his mind; then he boasts of himself <span class="insertion">while insulting</span> the <span class="insertion">other</span> bhikṣus <span class="insertion">by saying</span>: ‘I am fit to receive<a class="t" id="tT2_600a"></a> respectful offerings, these bhikṣus are not.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea20.4.8"></a>“Therefore, bhikṣus, you should train <span class="insertion">to be</span> like the royal lion and not like the sheep. Thus, O bhikṣus, you should train.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc.ea20.4.9"></a>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the bhikṣus were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
