<h3>Connected Discourses with Kassapa</h3>
<h1>4. A Visitor of Families</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthı̄. “Bhikkhus, what do you think, what kind of bhikkhu is worthy to be a visitor of families, and what kind of bhikkhu is not worthy to be a visitor of families?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One….”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>The Blessed One said this: “Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu might approach families with the thought: ‘May they give to me, not hold back! May they give me much, not a little! May they give me fine things, not shabby things! May they give me promptly, not slowly! May they give me considerately, not casually!’ When a bhikkhu approaches families with such a thought, if they do not give, he thereby becomes hurt; on that account he experiences pain and displeasure. If they give little rather than much ... If they give shabby things rather than fine things ... If they give slowly rather than promptly … If they give casually rather than considerately, he thereby becomes hurt; <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.201"></a> on that account he experiences pain and displeasure. Such a bhikkhu is not worthy to be a visitor of families.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu might approach families with the thought: ‘When among others’ families, how could I possibly think: “May they give to me, not hold back!… May they give me respectfully, not casually!”?’ When a bhikkhu approaches families with such a thought, if they do not give ... if they give casually rather than considerately, he does not thereby become hurt; he does not on that account experience pain and displeasure. Such a bhikkhu is worthy to be a visitor of families.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Bhikkhus, Kassapa approaches families with such a thought…. Thus if they do not give … if they give casually rather than considerately, he does not thereby become hurt; <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.202"></a> he does not on that account experience pain and displeasure.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Bhikkhus, I will exhort you by the example of Kassapa or one who is similar to Kassapa. Being exhorted, you should practise accordingly.”</p>
