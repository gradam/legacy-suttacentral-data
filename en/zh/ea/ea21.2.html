</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard. <span>At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anthāpiṇḍada’s Park. Then the Exalted One said to the bhikṣus:</span></span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“There are three <span class="supplied">kinds of</span> meritorious actions (<i lang="pi">puṇyakriyā</i>). Which are the three? A) The meritorious action consisting in generosity (<i lang="pi">dāna</i>), b) equilibrium (<i lang="pi">samatā</i>) and in c) <span class="supplied">wise</span> reflection (<i lang="pi">manasikāra</i>).</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“What does meritorious action consisting in generosity mean? When there is someone, happily making donations to ascetics and brahmins, to the poorest of the poor, to the bereaved and uprooted; who, when food is needed, provides food, and when encouragement is needed, gives encouragement; who <span class="supplied">offers</span> robes alms-food, lodging, medicine for treating the sick, fragrant substances, flowers (<i lang="pi">gandhapuṣpa</i>) and temporary accommodation unstintingly, contenting himself with what he has on the body—this is what is called the meritorious action of generosity.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“What does meritorious action consisting in equilibrium mean? When there is someone who does not deprive of life, does not steal and is always possessed of modesty and conscientiousness (<i lang="pi">hrīvyapatrāpya</i>); who does not take delight in evil thoughts, is not a thief, much given to generosity towards people and who is no miser; whose speech is conciliatory, refined and not offending anybody; who, living the holy life (<i lang="pi">brahmacarya</i>), does not practise sexual intercourse; who is content with <span class="supplied">just keeping</span> his own frame <span class="supplied">going</span>; who does not tell lies, always paying attention to being absolutely honest, without cheating and lying; who is neither elated nor dejected <span class="supplied">becouse of</span> that which the worldling esteems; who, not taking intoxicants, never fails to avoid stupefaction; who, futhermore, suffuses one quarter <span class="supplied">of the cardinal points</span> with friendliness (<i lang="pi">maitrī</i>), two quarters, three, four quarters, and also the quarters of the intermediate points of the compass, the zenith and nadir, who suffuses the whole <span class="supplied">world</span>, boundlessly, without limits and absolutely beyond measure; who causes with a heart <span class="supplied">full</span> of friendliness everything to be enveloped and <span class="supplied">thus</span> realises peace of mind (<i lang="pi">kṣema</i>); who, moreover, suffuses one quarter <span class="supplied">of the cardinal points</span> with a heart <span class="supplied">full</span> of compassion (<i lang="pi">karuṇā</i>), sympathetic joy (<i lang="pi">muditā</i>), and equanimity, two quarters…; who suffuses the whole <span class="supplied">world</span> with a heart <span class="supplied">full</span> of compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity—this is what is called the meritorious action of equilibrium.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“What does the existential constituent “meritorious action consisting in <span class="supplied">wise</span> reflection” mean? When there is a bhikṣu who, given to practice, is intent on recollection (<i lang="pi">smṛti)</i> and perfect awakening (<i lang="pi">sambodhi</i>); who does not succumb to attachment and with whom deliberation has ceased; who relies on giving up (<i lang="pi">prahāṇa</i>) and on what necessarily leads to <span class="supplied">ultimate</span> release (<i lang="pi">nairyāṇika</i>); who, practising the dharma “being intent on perfect awakening”, is intent on recollection and perfect awakening, on perfect awakening <span class="supplied">by means of</span> an exclamation, on perfect awakening <span class="supplied">by means of</span> the absorptions (<i lang="pi">dhyāna</i>) and <span class="supplied">by means of</span> restraint (<i lang="pi">saṃvara</i>); who does not succumb to attachment … relies on … what necessarily leads to <span class="supplied">ultimate</span> release—this is what is called the meritorious action of <span class="supplied">wise</span> reflection. These are, bhikṣus, the three <span class="supplied">kinds of</span> meritorious action.”</p>
<p>Then the Exalted One uttered the following verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Generosity and equilibrium/friendliness, and<br>
Nurturing <span class="supplied">wise</span> reflection—these are the three basics;<br>
The wise set great store by them; here and now they<br>
Reap the rewards which, of course, <span class="supplied">ensure</span> heavenly existence.<br>
By means of these three basics one will,<br>
Beyond any doubt, be born among the gods.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“Therefore, bhikṣus, one should be intent on skill in means as a <span class="supplied">guide</span>—rope to these three basics. Thus, bhikṣus, you should train.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the bhikṣus were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
