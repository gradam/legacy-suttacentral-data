<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“There are two modes of behaviour (<i lang="pi">vṛtti</i>) which a person in quest of the <span class="supplied">highest</span> truth should avoid. Which are the two? Desiring, craving for objects of sensual pleasure which by its very nature (<i lang="pi">dharma</i>) is low, vulgar and unprofitable. On the other hand, all <span class="supplied">sorts of</span> mortification (<i lang="pi">pīḍana</i>), many acts of harming (<i lang="pi">vihiṃsana</i>) and endless <span class="supplied">tormenting</span> thoughts. These are the two modes of behaviour which a person in quest of the <span class="supplied">highest</span> truth should avoid. Having given up these two modes of behaviour, on my own I gained the highest truth and became fully enlightened. Vision arose, superknowledge (<i lang="pi">abhijñā</i>) arose, my mind became <span class="supplied">truly</span> calm. I obtained all the supernormal powers (<i lang="pi">ṛddhi</i>) and realised the fruition of recluseship—Nirvāṇa.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Now what is the supreme path leading to Full Enlightenment, making for vision, for superknowledge, for one’s mind to become <span class="supplied">truly</span> calm, for obtaining all supernormal powers and for realising the fruition of recluseship—Nirvāṇa? It is this very noble eightfold path, viz. extraordinary (<i lang="pi">adhika</i>) views, extraordinary prevention (<i lang="pi">pratikāra</i>), extraordinary speech, extraordinary bodily action, extraordinary livelihood, extraordinary skill in means (<i lang="pi">upāya-kauśalya</i>), extraordinary mindfulness, extraordinary concentration. This is what is called the supreme path.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“At this time I have become fully enlightened, vision has arisen, superknowledge has arisen, my mind has become <span class="supplied">truly</span> calm, I have obtained all supernormal powers and realised the fruition of recluseship—Nirvana. Therefore, O bhikṣus, one should train to give up the above<span class="supplied">-mentioned</span> two modes of behaviour and practice in accordance with the supreme path.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the bhikṣus were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
