<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“There are these two modes of behaviour (<i lang="pi">dharma</i>) which do not allow of a person’s being wise. Which are the two? (1) To have an aversion to consulting experienced and capable persons and (2) to be much given to slothness (<i lang="pi">middha</i>) and lethargy (<i lang="pi">avīrya-citta</i>). These are, monks, the two modes of behaviour that do not allow of a person’s being wise.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“There are, therefore, two modes of behaviour which allow of a person’s obtaining perfect wisdom. Which two? (1) To be eager in asking others to clarify something and (2) to be full of vivacity rather than sloth. It is, O bhikṣus, these two modes of behaviour which allow of a person’s being wise.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“One should train to overcome these modes of karmically unwholesome behaviour. Thus, O monks, one should actually train.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the bhikṣus were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
