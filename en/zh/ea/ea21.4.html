</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="small-caps">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then the Exalted One said to the bhikṣus:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“If there are persons <span class="supplied">towards whom you</span> cultivate friendliness (<i>maitrī</i>) in your hearts, <span class="supplied">who</span> think <span class="supplied">they can</span> really trust <span class="supplied">in you</span> and who listen <span class="supplied">to you</span> respectfully, <span class="supplied">viz.</span> father and mother, brothers, family members, relatives, friends or inmates, <span class="supplied">you should</span> establish <span class="supplied">them</span> in three bases (<i>sthāna</i>) <span class="supplied">on which they should take their stand</span> unwaveringly. Which are the three?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“They should be encouraged (<i>sam-ut-thā</i>, √<i>sthā</i>) unwaveringly to take delight (<i>prīti</i>) in the Tathāgata <span class="supplied">thus</span>: He is the Tathāgata who has realized absolute truth (<i>paramārthāgata</i>), the Fully and Completely Enlightened One, perfect in knowledge and conduct, the Blessed One, Knower of the universe, the Incomparable One (<i>anuttarapuruṣa</i>), the Teaching Guide <span class="supplied">to show sentient beings</span> the Way (<i>mārgadharmasārathi</i>), the Teacher of Gods and Men, the Buddha, the Exalted One.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Again, they should be encouraged to direct their attention to the Teachings <span class="supplied">thus</span>: The Tathāgata’s Dharma is well proclaimed, inviting (<i>aihipaśyika</i>), in the highest degree (<i>paramataḥ</i>) making for exquisiteness (<i>sūkṣmatā</i>), yielding immediate results (<i>sāṃdṛṣṭika</i>) and thus to be understood by the wise (<i>vedanīyo vijñaiḥ</i>).</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Similarly, they should be encouraged to contemplate and honour (√<i>man</i>) this Order of the Disciples, the Tathāgata’s Śrāvakasaṃgha, <span class="supplied">thus</span>: <span class="supplied">Among them</span> prevails absolute concord (<i>sāmagrī),</i> they walk in the right path (<i>nyāyapratipanna</i>), are endowed with all virtues and have achieved perfection in moral training, concentration and wisdom, in <span class="supplied">ultimate</span> freedom (<i>vimukti</i>) and insight-knowledge of this freedom, that is to say the Order of Disciples, the four pairs <span class="supplied">of noble persons</span> and the eight <span class="supplied">kinds of <i>āryas</i></span>. This is the Tathāgata’s Śrāvakasaṃgha, worthy of respect (<i>gauravārha</i>) and worthy of veneration; this is the world’s incomparable field of merit (<i>puṇyakṣetra</i>). Whoever, bhikṣus, trains in these three bases will achieve great results (<i>phalavipaka</i>). Thus, bhikṣus, you should train.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the bhikṣus were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
