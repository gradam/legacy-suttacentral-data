<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time, the Buddha was in Śrāvastī, in the Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s park. At that time, the Bhagavān said to the bhikṣus, “There are five dharmas that bring many abundant benefits for the cultivation of Ānāpānasmṛti. What are these five?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“[1] One should abide in the pure precepts of the Prātimokṣa rules and practices, abiding and progressing perfectly with majestic deportment, with fear and concern arising for even minor transgressions. Accepting, maintaining, and studying the precepts is called the first practice that brings many abundant benefits for the cultivation of Ānāpānasmṛti. [2] Moreover, bhikṣus, one should have few desires, few possessions, and few affairs to attend to. This is called the second dharma which brings many abundant benefits for the cultivation of Ānāpānasmṛti. [3] Moreover, bhikṣus, one should know moderation in food and drink, having neither too much nor too little, to not give rise to thoughts seeking and desiring food and drink, and consider only essential matters. This is called the third dharma which brings many abundant benefits for the cultivation of Ānāpānasmṛti. [4] Moreover, bhikṣus, one should not slumber at the beginning of the night or at the end of the night, considering only the essential matters. This is called the fourth dharma which brings many abundant benefits for the cultivation of Ānāpānasmṛti. [5] Moreover, bhikṣus, one should spend leisure time within the forest, apart from various troubles and conflicts. This is called the fifth dharma which brings many abundant benefits for the cultivation of Ānāpānasmṛti.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>After the Buddha had spoken this sūtra, then the bhikṣus heard what the Buddha had said, and blissfully practiced in accordance.</p>
