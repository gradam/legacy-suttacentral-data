<h1>13 Striving</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these four right strivings. What four? (1) Here, a bhikkhu generates desire for the non-arising of unarisen bad unwholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. (2) He generates desire for the abandoning of arisen bad unwholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. (3) He generates desire for the arising of unarisen wholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. (4) He generates desire for the persistence of arisen wholesome states, for their non-decline, increase, expansion, and fulfillment by development; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. These are the four right strivings.”</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Those who strive rightly<br>
overcome the realm of Māra;<br>
they are unattached,<br>
gone beyond fear of birth and death.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>They are contented and unstirred,<br>
having conquered Māra and his mount;<br>
those happy ones have overcome<br>
all Namuci’s armies. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.ii.16"></a><br></p>
