At that time the venerable Sāriputta was on Mount Vulture Peak.</p> 
<p>Then a householder’s son by the name of Soṇa, who every day used to roam around, reached Mount Vulture Peak and approached the venerable Sāriputta. He paid homage with his head at <span class="insertion">Sāriputta’s feet</span> and withdrew to sit at one side.</p> 
<p>Then Sāriputta said: “Soṇa, if recluses and brahmins do not know form as it really is, do not know the arising of form as it really is, do not know the cessation of form as it really is, do not know the path to the cessation of form as it really is, then, Soṇa, you should know that for this reason these recluses and brahmins are not able to eradicate form.</p> 
<p>“In the same way recluses and brahmins who do not know feeling … perception … formations … consciousness as it really is, do not know the arising of consciousness as it really is, do not know the cessation of consciousness as it really is, do not know the path to the cessation of consciousness as it really is, then for this reason they are not able to eradicate consciousness.</p>

<p><span class="insertion">Sāriputta asked</span>: “Soṇa, what do you think, is form permanent or is it impermanent?” <span class="insertion">Soṇa</span> replied: “It is impermanent.”</p> 
<p><span class="insertion">Sāriputta</span> asked again: “What is impermanent, is it <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>?” <span class="insertion">Soṇa</span> replied: “It is <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>.”</p> 
<p>Sāriputta said: “Form that is impermanent, <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>, of a nature to change, would a noble disciple herein regard such form as self, as distinct from the self <span class="insertion">in the sense of being owned by it</span>, as existing <span class="insertion">within the self, or the self</span> as existing <span class="insertion">within it</span>?” <span class="insertion">Soṇa</span> replied: “No.”</p>

<p><span class="insertion">Sāriputta said</span>: “Soṇa, you should know that <span class="insertion">whatever</span> form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all such form is not self,<a class="t" id="t7a"></a> is not distinct from the self <span class="insertion">in the sense of being owned by it</span>, does not exist <span class="insertion">within the self nor does a self</span> exist <span class="insertion">within it</span>. This is reckoned knowing it as it really is.</p> 
<p>“Soṇa, a noble disciple arouses disenchantment in regard to form, is free from desire for it and becomes liberated. He becomes liberated from birth, old age, disease, death, sorrow, sadness, pain and vexation.</p>

<p>“Soṇa <span class="insertion">whatever</span> feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all such consciousness is not self, is not distinct from the self <span class="insertion">in the sense of being owned by it</span>, does not exist <span class="insertion">within the self nor does a self</span> exist <span class="insertion">within it</span>.

<p>“Soṇa, a noble disciple rightly contemplates these five aggregates of clinging as not self and not mine. Rightly contemplating in this way he does not grasp at anything in the world. One who does not grasp is not attached to anything. One who is not attached to anything attains Nirvāṇa himself, <span class="insertion">knowing</span>: ‘Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of any further existence.’”</p> 
<p>Then Soṇa, hearing what Sāriputta had said, was thrilled with delight, paid homage and left.</p>
