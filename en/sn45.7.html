<h3>Connected Discourses on the Path</h3>
<h1>7. A Certain Bhikkhu (2)</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Venerable sir, it is said, ‘the removal of lust, the removal of hatred, the removal of delusion.’ Of what now, venerable sir, is this the designation?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“This, bhikkhu, is a designation for the element of Nibbana: the removal of lust, the removal of hatred, the removal of delusion. The destruction of the taints is spoken of in that way.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>When this was said, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, it is said, ‘the Deathless, the Deathless.’ What now, venerable sir, is the Deathless? What is the path leading to the Deathless?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“The destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of delusion: this is called the Deathless. This Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the Deathless; that is, right view … right concentration.”</p>
