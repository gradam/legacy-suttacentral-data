<h1>154. The Spike</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, suppose a spike of rice or a spike of barley were rightly directed and were pressed upon by the hand or the foot. That it could pierce the hand or the foot and draw blood: this is possible. For what reason? Because the spike is rightly directed. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.49"></a> So too, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu with a rightly directed view, with a rightly directed development of the path, could pierce ignorance, arouse true knowledge, and realize Nibbana: this is possible. For what reason? Because his view is rightly directed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And how does a bhikkhu do so? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view … right concentration, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu with a rightly directed view, with a rightly directed development of the path, pierces ignorance, arouses true knowledge, and realizes Nibbana.”</p>
