<p>“There are three bad practices. Which are the three?</p>
<p>“Bad practices of body, speech and mind. These, O bhikṣus, are the three bad practices.</p>
<p>“One should aspire to skill in means to cultivate three good practices. Which are the three?</p>
<p>“Somebody whose practice of body, speech and mind is bad, should cultivate good practice of body, speech, and mind.</p>
<p>Then the Exalted One uttered the following verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha"><p>“One should guard against bad practice of body and<br> Cultivate good practice of body; it 
<span class="insertion">should always</span> be<br> Kept in mind to give up bad practice of body,<br>
And good practice of body should be learnt.
</p>
<p>“One should guard against bad practice of speech and<br> Cultivate good practice of speech; it 
<span class="insertion">should always</span> be<br> Kept in mind to give up bad practice of speech,<br>
And good practice of speech should be learnt.
</p>
<p>“One should guard against bad practice of mind and<br> Cultivate good practice of mind; it 
<span class="insertion">should always</span> be<br> Kept in mind to give up bad practice of mind,<br>
And good practice of mind should be learnt.
</p>
<p>“<span class="insertion">Good</span> practice of body is excellent, and<br><span class="insertion">Good</span> practice of speech likewise, to be sure, <br><span class="insertion">Good</span> practice of mind is excellent, and the same<br> Holds true of 
<span class="insertion">good practice</span> in every respect.</p>
<p>“Restraint in speech, purity of mind and no bad practice<br> Of body—by realising purity in these three practices<br>
One will reach the 
<span class="insertion">Great</span> Sage’s state of the Unconditioned (<i lang="pi">asaṃskṛtasthāna</i>).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Thus, bhikṣus, one should give up the three bad practices and cultivate the three good practices, and thus, O bhikṣus, you should train.”</p>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the bhikṣus were pleased … to practice.</p>
