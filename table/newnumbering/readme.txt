The csv files in this directory are csv files used for creation of the json file. All links have been checked using the new numbering.
This is a dump of the parallels on SC, adjusted for the new numbering system.
The UID list are full parallels of each other, unless they are preceded by a "~", which means they are partial parallels of the main UIDs.
Entries preceded by a "?" are parallels to a text we do not have in SC and these are usually explained in the REMARKS.
mention: the first entry is being mentioned in the second, third, etc text.
So for instance, "mention": ["dhp#183", "ne10#11", "pe12#10"], means that dhp183 is mentioned in Netti 10#11 AND in pe12#10
Same with "retold", where the first entry is being retold in the second.

For new numbering, see:
