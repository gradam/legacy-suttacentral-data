<h1>22.48. Les agrégats</h1>
</div>
<p>At Savatthi. There the Blessed One said, «Monks, I will teach you the five aggregates &amp; the five clinging-aggregates. Listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak.»</p>
<p>«As you say, lord,» the monks responded.</p>
<p>The Blessed One said, «Now what, monks, are the five aggregates?</p>
<p>«Whatever form is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: that is called the aggregate of form.</p>
<p>«Whatever feeling is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: that is called the aggregate of feeling.</p>
<p>«Whatever perception is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: that is called the aggregate of perception.</p>
<p>«Whatever (mental) fabrications are past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: those are called the aggregate of fabrications.</p>
<p>«Whatever consciousness is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: that is called the aggregate of consciousness.</p>
<p>«These are called the five aggregates.</p>
<p>«And what are the five clinging-aggregates?</p>
<p>«Whatever form—past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near—is clingable, offers sustenance, and is accompanied with mental fermentation: that is called form as a clinging-aggregate.</p>
<p>«Whatever feeling—past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near—is clingable, offers sustenance, and is accompanied with mental fermentation: that is called feeling as a clinging-aggregate.</p>
<p>«Whatever perception—past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near—is clingable, offers sustenance, and is accompanied with mental fermentation: that is called perception as a clinging-aggregate.</p>
<p>«Whatever (mental) fabrications—past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near—are clingable, offer sustenance, and are accompanied with mental fermentation: those are called fabrications as a clinging-aggregate.</p>
<p>«Whatever consciousness—past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near—is clingable, offers sustenance, and is accompanied with mental fermentation: that is called consciousness as a clinging-aggregate.</p>
<p>«These are called the five clinging-aggregates.»</p>
