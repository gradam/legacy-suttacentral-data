<h3>Eulogy on the Prātimokṣasūtra</h3>
<p class="namo">
Obeisance to the Omniscient One</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>
I bow down my head to the Foremost of Beings<br>
who was a flag of glory renowned in the three worlds,<br>
who proclaimed in a lion’s roar the message of the Sacred Faith,<br>
who obtained the precious treasure of omniscience,<br>
whose feet were touched by the crest-gems of Brahma and Indra<br>
and who crossed the bottomless and boundless ocean of miseries.
<span class="gatha-number">1</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
The Prātimokṣasūtra is the basis of training in omniscience,<br>
it is a casket of jewels kept apart in the community of monks,<br>
it is a vast lake filled with the rules of Buddhist discipline,<br>
and it is the essence of all things existing in the fathomless and
limitless universe. <span class="gatha-number">2</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
It is the great leader of all holy doctrines<br>
taught by the Lord of Faith;<br>
and it is the emporium of all articles of study<br>
for the community of monks who are comparable to traders.
<span class="gatha-number">3</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
It is the medicine for curing the maladies<br>
of those who are distressed through the transgression of moral laws;<br>
and it is the ironwhip for young men who are deluded by their age.
<span class="gatha-number">4</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
It is the means of crossing the wide ocean of rotatory existence,<br>
and it is the firm embankment and a bridge<br>
to those who move towards the good spheres of life.
<span class="gatha-number">5</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
It is the way which leads to the conquest of troubles,<br>
it is an excellent guide to the king,<br>
and it exists as a ladder<br>
for entering the city of emancipation. <span class="gatha-number">6</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>
“When I enter Nirvāṇa the Prātimokṣasūtra will be your Teacher.”<br>
Remembering those words you should, O community of monks,<br>
assemble together to recite it with reverence due to Buddha himself.<br>
lt is the very name of Buddha—so rare in all the worlds.
<span class="gatha-number">7</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>
It is very difficult to acquire birth as man,<br>
still very rare it is to be a monk,<br>
and rarer yet is the monk’s perfect code of moral laws;<br>
and though the code of laws may be absolutely pure,<br>
it is very difficult to get a good spiritual guide.
<span class="gatha-number">8</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>
Finding that it is very rare for a Buddha to appear on this earth<br>
and for a being to be born as a man,<br>
or to become a monk,<br>
or to obtain a perfect code of moral laws,<br>
or to get a good spiritual guide—<br>
the sages desirous of doing good to their selves,<br>
and wishing to attain the two paths with their fruits should endeavour,<br>
with earnestness, to hear the Prātimokṣasūtra.
<span class="gatha-number">9</span> <span class="gatha-number">10</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>
The Buddhas, steady in renunciation,<br>
who were the chiefs of monks and masters of disciplinary laws,<br>
desirous of attaining the true emancipation,<br>
perpetually guarded the Prātimokṣasūtra. <span class="gatha-number">11</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>
Even in millions of ages it is difficult<br>
to hear, receive and grasp the Prātimokṣasūtra—<br>
to follow it up is much more difficult. <span class="gatha-number">12</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>
Blessed is the birth of Buddhas,<br>
blessed too is the exposition of dharma,<br>
harmony in the community of monks is a bliss<br>
and blissful is the devotion of those who are in harmony.
<span class="gatha-number">13</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>
Blessed is the sight of a Noble One,<br>
blessed too is the association with a holy spirit<br>
and absence of the sight of sinful persons<br>
is indeed a perpetual bliss. <span class="gatha-number">14</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a>
Blessed is the sight of one who observes moral laws,<br>
blessed too is the sight of a learned person,<br>
the sight of Arhats is a bliss for getting rid of rebirths.
<span class="gatha-number">15</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a>
Blessed is the river which has pleasant banks<br>
and blessed is the person who meditates on Dharma;<br>
the attainment of wisdom is a bliss<br>
and so is the destruction of arrogance. <span class="gatha-number">16</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a>
Blessed is the existence of persons<br>
who have perfectly subdued their senses,<br>
have grown old in peaceful monasteries<br>
and have screened their youthful age<br>
in the forest of learned men. <span class="gatha-number">17</span></p>

<h2>Speech of the monk who recites the Prātimokṣasūtra.</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a>
Brethren, some seasons of the year are over and some are to come. How many?
So many. Brethren, since old age and death are fast approaching, and since
the doctrine of the Teacher is about to perish, it behoves the community of
monks to practise discipline. The Tathāgata, the Arhat attained full
enlightenment. Some others too following him achieved with earnestness the
blessed dharma leaning to the side of enlightenment. Our community of monks,
devotees of Lord Buddha, are engaged here in petty concerns. Our acts being
sordid we should consider what should be the foremost duty of our community.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a>
Let us ask the approval, and enquire about the purity, of the monks who are
not come. After that I should repeat the following:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a>
Bowing down to Sakya Simha with folded palms<br>
you hear from me for the sake of your discipline<br>
the Prātimokṣasūtra which is recited. <span class="gatha-number">18</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a>
Having heard what has been said by the Great Sage,<br>
you must act according to the same,<br>
and must apply yourselves diligently<br>
to avoid the smallest transgressions. <span class="gatha-number">19</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a>
This Prātimokṣasūtra is indeed a bridle<br>
to the person who moves on with perpetual exertions<br>
and who striking his horselike mind with a sharp whip<br>
makes it follow the commandments fallen from the mouth of Buddha.
<span class="gatha-number">20</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="22"></a>
Those great persons who do not turn away<br>
even by their speech from the proper course,<br>
are comparable to noble horses<br>
that gain sure victory in the war of troubles.
<span class="gatha-number">21</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="23"></a>
Those, to whom this is not a bridle<br>
or who do not desire it in their heart,<br>
are confounded by the war of troubles<br>
and wander away in a disconcerted state. <span class="gatha-number">22</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Nidāna</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="24"></a>
Brethren, listen to me, I pray. Today is the 14th or 15th day of the lunar
month for the celebration of <i>Poṣadha</i> by the community of monks. If it
is convenient to the community, let us celebrate <i>Poṣadha</i> and recite
the Prātimokṣasūtra. O brethren, we do perform the ceremony of <i>Poṣadha</i>
and recite the Prātimokṣasūtra.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="25"></a>
Whosoever among you has committed any fault, let him confess it. If there is
no fault, say nothing whatsoever. If nothing is said I am to understand that
the brethren are perfectly pure. As a monk gives an answer if a question is
put to him separately, so each monk is to give an answer when a question is
repeated three times in a community of monks like this. Whatsoever monk in
such a community, thus interrogated three times, does not confess a fault of
which there is recollection is guilty of uttering a deliberate lie. The
uttering of a deliberate lie has, brethren, been declared by Lord Buddha be
an obstacle on the way. Therefore a monk who has committed a fault and
desires to be cleansed therefrom should confess it if he remembers the same.
Having made confession he will reside in happiness. But if he does not
confess or declare his fault, he will not be happy.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="26"></a>
O brethren, I have recited the Introduction to the Prātimokṣasūtra. I now
ask you whether you are perfectly pure in this matter. I ask you a second
time and a third time. In this matter the brethren are perfectly pure,
therefore they say nothing, so do I understand.</p>
<h2><a id="pj">Four Rules regarding Defeat</a></h2>
<p class="uddana">
<a class="sc" id="27"></a>
Summary:<br>
Impure conduct, theft, murder and falsehood these are the four
(transgressions) regarding which rules are given here.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="28"></a>
Here are, brethren, four rules regarding Defeat as known from the
Prātimokṣasūtra recited each half-month.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="pj1">Pārājika 1</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="29"></a>
Whatsoever monk, who has received the monk’s system of training and has not
abandoned or injured it, indulges himself in impure intercourse down even
with a brute beast, incurs Defeat and must not live in the community of
monks.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="pj2">Pārājika 2</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="30"></a>
Whatsoever monk living in a village or monastery takes a thing not
given—which is counted as theft—in such a manner that a king or a minister
would seize him and kill, imprison or banish him saying “You are a thief,
you are stupid, you are dishonest”—the monk, who thus takes a thing not
given, incurs Defeat and must not live in the community of monks.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="pj3">Pārājika 3</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="31"></a>
Whatsoever monk deliberately takes away the life of a human being, or
procures a weapon for his death, or seeks out an assassin against him, or
instigates him to self-destruction or eulogises death saying, “man, what
good do you get from this sinful, impure and wretched life; it is better for
you to die than to live”—that is, willingly and intentionally instigates a
human being to commit suicide or celebrates to him the praises of death in
such a way that in consequence thereof he diesthe monk who thus causes the
death of a human being incurs Defeat and must not live in the community of
monks.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="pj4">Pārājika 4</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="32"></a>
Whatsoever monk without possessing a clear and perfect knowledge speaks of
himself, “I possess superhuman knowledge, I am an elect, I am a specialist,
I know this, I see this, without such practice something is not known and
something is not seen; and finding that transgression has arisen from such
profession and being desirous of cleansing himself therefrom, the monk at
another time, whether asked or unasked, speaks thus, “O brethren, when I
knew not I said that I knew, when I saw not I said that I saw, it was but
vain, wild and false language”—the monk who speaks in this way, except
through excessive confidence, incurs Defeat and must not live in the
community of monks.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="sc" id="33"></a>
I have, O brethren, recited the four rules regarding Defeat. If a monk has
committed transgression arising from the breach of any of the rules, he
incurs Defeat and must not afterwards live in the community of monks
deprived as he is of their privileges.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="34"></a>
In this respect I ask, “O brethren, are you perfectly pure?” A second time
and a third time I ask, “O brethren, are you perfectly pure?” In this
respect the brethren are perfectly pure, therefore they say nothing, so do I
understand.</p>
<h2><a id="ss">Thirteen Rules regarding Suspension from Monkhood</a></h2>
<p class="uddana">
<a class="sc" id="35"></a>
Summary:<br>
Emission of semen, contact, discourse, bodily service, intermediation,
house, monastery, groundless, a mere trifle, causing dissension, siding,
corrupting family, and harsh speech.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="36"></a>
Here are, brethren, thirteen rules regarding Suspension from monkhood as
known from the Prātimokṣasūtra recited each half-month.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="ss1">Saṅghādhiśeṣa 1</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="37"></a>
A conscious emission of semen, except in a dream, is a transgression which
causes Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="ss2">Saṅghādhiśeṣa 2</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="38"></a>
Whatsoever monk comes, with a perverted mind, into bodily contact with a
woman or takes hold of her hand or shoulder or braid of hair, or touches any
other parts of her body for enjoyment, commits a transgression which causes
Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="ss3">Saṅghādhiśeṣa 3</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="39"></a>
Whatsoever monk holds, with a perverted mind, a vicious discourse with a
woman regarding sexual intercourse, such as a youth would hold with a
damsel, commits a transgression which causes Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="ss4">Saṅghādhiśeṣa 4</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="40"></a>
Whatsoever monk, in order to secure the bodily service of a woman to
himself, says, with a perverted mind, in her presence, that “the service
rendered by one’s own body, through an act of intercourse, to a monk of such
character, conduct, and purity as myself, is the best of all services”—(he)
extolling the woman’s bodilv service, commits a transgression which causes
suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="ss5">Saṅghādhiśeṣa 5</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="41"></a>
Whatsoever monk by conveying the words of a man to woman or those of a woman
to a man acts as an intermediary for a wife, a paramour or even for a
harlot, commits a transgression which causes Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="ss6">Saṅghādhiśeṣa 6</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="42"></a>
If a monk bringing materials together causes a house to be built up for
himself, independent of a layman, he must take care to observe the proper
measurements. And herein this is the measurement: the house inside must be
twelve of Buddha’s spans in length and seven of those spans in breadth. For
the inspection of the site he must bring a community of monks who should see
that the site is suitable, is not exposed to danger and is easy of access If
the monk, in spite of the site being unsuitable or exposed to danger or not
being easy of access, brings materials on his own account and causes a house
to be built up for himself independent of a layman without taking the
community of monks for the inspection or without showing them the site and
also deviating from the proper measurements—(he) commits a transgression
which causes Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="ss7">Saṅghādhiśeṣa 7</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="43"></a>
If a monk seeks to build for monks a large monastery in which there shall be
a resident layman, he must bring for the inspection of the site a community
of monks who ought to see that the site is suitable, is not exposed to
danger and is easy of access. If the monk, in spite of the site being
unsuitable, exposed to danger and not being easy of access, builds for monks
the monastery in which there shall be a resident layman, without bringing
the community of monks for the inspection or without showing them the
site—(he) commits a transgression which causes Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="ss8">Saṅghādhiśeṣa 8</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="44"></a>
Whatsoever monk being angry prefers, out of malice, against an innocent monk
the charge of Defeat, which is groundless, thinking “I may thus remove him
anyhow from the course of purity”; and then at another time being asked or
unasked says that the charge is groundless and that it was preferred out of
malice—(he) commits a transgression which causes Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="ss9">Saṅghādhiśeṣa 9</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="45"></a>
If a monk being angry prefers, out of malice, against an innocent monk a
charge of Defeat which is unreal but accords with apart of another dispute,
thinking “I may thus remove him anyhow from the course of purity”; and then
at another time being asked or unasked says that the charge is unreal and
that it was brought on account of its having accorded with a part of another
dispute, the monk who out of malice and through imagination alone prefers
the charge based thus on a mere trifle commits a transgression which causes
Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="ss10">Saṅghādhiśeṣa 10</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="46"></a>
Whatsoever monk endeavours to cause dissension in a community of monks that
is in harmony or persists in emphasising the points calculated to cause
dissension, should be addressed by other monks thus: “O brother, do not
endeavour to cause dissension in the community of monks that is in harmony,
do not persist in emphasising the points calculated to cause dissension,
live in harmony with the community of monks, the community being in harmony
there will be no innovations and they being in peace there will be no
disputation: combining with one another, as milk combines with water, they
do brighten the doctrine of Buddha and live in happiness. Brother, you
abandon your expedients to cause dissension in the community of monks.” If
the monk being thus addressed by other monks abandons his expedients it is
well. But if he abandons them not, he should be admonished a second time and
a third time. Being thus formally admonished if he gives up his expedients,
it is well; but if he does not, he commits a transgression which causes
Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="ss11">Saṅghādhiśeṣa 11</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="47"></a>
If certain monks—one, two or more—do, out of friendship, side with a monk
who speaks out dissension, and address a community of monks thus: “O
brethren, do not say anything good or bad to this dissentient monk. Why so?
Because, brethren, the monk speaks according to the law, he speaks according
to the precepts, receiving well the law and precepts he holds them carefully
and observes them, and he speaks with knowledge and not without it. Since he
speaks only when he is so desired, it is our desire that he should speak.”
Then the community of monks should answer the monks thus: “Say not, sirs,
that the dissentient monk speaks according to the law; that he speaks
according to the precepts; that he receiving well the law and precepts,
holds them carefully and observes them; that he speaks with knowledge and
not without it and that since he speaks only when he is so desired, it is
our desire that he should speak.” Why so? “O sirs, this dissentient monk
speaks not according to the law, he speaks not according to the precepts, he
has not received well the law and precepts to hold them carefully or observe
them. He speaks without knowledge and not with it. Since he speaks only when
he is so desired, do not, sirs, desire him to speak. Do not, sirs, desire
that there should be dissension in the community of monks: on the contrary
desire, sirs, that there should be harmony in the community. The community
of monks being in harmony there will be no innovations, they being in peace
there will be no disputation: combining with one another, as milk combines
with water, they do brighten the doctrine of Buddha and live in happiness.
Do not, sirs, side with this monk who speaks out dissension in the
community.” If the monks being thus answered by the community abandon their
course, it is well. If they abandon it not, they should be formally
admonished a second time and a third time. Being thus formally admonished if
they abandon their course it is well. But if they abandon it not they commit
a transgression which causes Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="ss12">Saṅghādhiśeṣa 12</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="48"></a>
If many monks dwelling near a village or a town corrupt familes and
perpetrate evil deeds and the families corrupted by them are seen, heard and
known, and the evil deeds perpetrated are also seen, heard and known, those
monks should be addressed by a community of monks thus: “O brethren, you are
corrupters of families and perpetrators of evil deeds; the families
corrupted by you are seen, heard and known; and your evil deeds too are
seen, heard and known: brethren, you have dwelt here long enough, go away
now from this place.” Being so addressed if they should answer the community
of monks thus: “O brethren, some of you here are walking in lust, some in
malice, some in delusion and some in fear; and for a fault of a like nature
you do remove some monks while others you do not remove”—the community
should in return answer thus: “O brethren, do not say that some of us walk
in lust, some in malice, some in delusion and some in fear; and for a fault
of a like nature we remove some monks while others we do not remove. Why so?
We monks do not walk in lust, we do not walk in malice, we do not walk in
delusion and we do not walk in fear. Brethren, you are corrupters of
families and perpetrators of evil deeds; and you yourselves have seen, heard
and known the corrupters of families and perpetrators of evil deeds: give up
your talk that we monks walk in lust, in malice, in delusion and in fear.”
If those monks being thus addressed by the community of monks abandon their
evil course it is well. But if they abandon it not, they should be formally
admonished a second time and a third time. If they then abandon their evil
course, it is well; but if they do not, they commit a transgression which
causes Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="ss13">Saṅghādhiśeṣa 13</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="49"></a>
If a monk of harsh speech, when spoken to by a community of monks about
matters of training in accordance with the law and precepts delivered by
Buddha, says: “Brethren, do not say anything, good or bad, to me; I too
shall say nothing, good or bad, to you; brethren, refrain from speaking to
me, I too shall refrain from speaking to you. There is in fact nothing to be
spoken about”—he should be addressed by the community of monks thus: “O
brother, when you are spoken to by the community of monks about matters of
training in accordance with the law and precepts delivered by Buddha, do not
make yourself a person who cannot be spoken to, make yourself rather a
person to whom we can speak. brother, when the monks speak to you in
accordance with the law and precepts, you too should speak to them in
accordance with the same. By mutual conversation and mutual instruction you
do save one another from falling into transgression. Thus grows up the
monkhood established by our fully Enlightened Lord, the Blessed Tathāgata,
the Vanquisher of enemies. Brother, abandon your resolution of not being
spoken to.” If the monk thus addressed by the community of monks abandons
his resolution, it is good. But if he does not, he should be formally
admonished a second time and a third time. If he then abandons his
resolution, it is good; but if he does not, he commits a transgression which
causes Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="sc" id="50"></a>
Brethren, I have recited the thirteen rules regarding transgressions which
cause Suspension from monkhood. Of these the first nine become
transgressions at once, while the remaining four do not become
transgressions until the end of the third admonition. If a monk commits any
of these transgressions, he must, even against his wish, live in a separate
residence for as many days as he knowingly concealed his transgressions.
After this has been done he must, for six further days, cultivate reverence
for monkhood. Thereupon He should, while acting according to the law, be
reinstated in some place where there is a community of at least twenty
monks. If the community being a body of less than twenty, even by one,
should reinstate that monk he is not reinstated and that community deserves
censure. This is the prescribed course in the matter.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="51"></a>
In this respect I ask, “O brethren, are you perfectly pure?” A second time
and a third time I ask, “O brethren, are you perfectly pure?” In this
respect the brethren are perfectly pure, therefore they say nothing, so do I
understand.</p>
<h2><a id="an">Two Rules regarding Undetermined Matters</a></h2>
<p class="uddana">
Summary:<br>
Sitting in a solitary protected place.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="52"></a>
Here are, O brethren, two rules regarding Undetermined Matters as known from
the Prātimokṣasūtra recited each half-month.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="an1">Aniyata 1</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="53"></a>
If a monk sits together with a woman in a solitary protected place sultable
for tlie carrying out of lustful desires; and if a female devotee of
undoubted veracity charges him with one or other of the three offences,
viz., that which causes Defeat or Suspension or requires Expiation, then the
monk, if he acknowledges that he so sat, should be held guilty of the
offence which he has committed or with which he has been charged. This is an
Undetermined Matter.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="an2">Aniyata 2</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="54"></a>
If a monk sits together with a woman in a solitary protected place, which is
however not suitable for the carrying out of lustful desires; and if a
female devotee of undoubted veracity charges him with one or other of the
two offences, viz., that which causes Suspension or requires Expiation, then
the monk, if he acknowledges that he so sat, should be held guilty of the
offence which he has committed or with which he has been charged. This is an
Undetermined Matter.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="sc" id="55"></a>
O brethren, I have recited the two Undetermined Matters. I ask you whether
you are perfectly pure in this respect. A second time and a third time I ask
you whether you are perfectly pure in this respect. In this respect the
brethren are perfectly pure. Therefore they do not say anything. So do I
understand.</p>

<h4><span class="add">
<a id="np1">Nissaggiya 1</a>

After a set of Kathina robes has been obtained and made ready for a monk, if
another set of robes be offered to him out of season it may be accepted by
him should he so wish. After it has been accepted any deficiency thereof (in
point of length, etc.) should be made up at once. Being unable to make up
the deficiency, if he entertains a hope to do the same soon, he may keep the
set for a month. If he keeps it beyond that time he commits a transgression

If a monk has been robbed of his robe, or if his robe has been destroyed,
burnt or carried away by wind or water, he should go to a layman or a
laywoman not related to him, for the same. If the faithful layman offers him
a choice from among the materials for many robes that monk should take
materials sufficient to make an upper and a lower garment of due
measurement. If he takes materials beyond the limit, he commits a

something fine says: “O gentle one, the price which you have set apart for a

before the offer has been made to him, goes to the layman and his wife and
expressing a desire for getting something fine says: “O gentle ones, the
price which each of you has set apart for a set of robes for me, with that
let each of you purchase such and such a set and folding the two sets
together make them one and clothe me with the same”—if the sets are thus

If a king or a minister or a brāhmaṇa or a householder or a townsman or a
villager or a rich man or a trader sends through a messenger the price of a
set of robes for a particular monk, and if the messenger going to the monk
gently says: “O sir, the price of a set of robes has been sent to you
through me, graciously accept it.” Then the monk should answer the messenger
thus: “O friend, it is not appropriate for us to accept the price of robes,
but we can accept a set of robes of the suitable kind at the right time.” If
then that messenger answers thus: “Sir, have you got any agent to look to
your requisites?” Then the monks desirous of getting the set should poitnt
out to him the guard of the monastery or any other devotee as the agent who
looks to his requisites. The messenger taking the price of the set should go
to the agent and address him thus: “O agent, my friend, attend to me. With
this price of a set of robes may you purchase such and such a set of robes
and clothe with the same the monk of such and such a name when he arrives.”
Having spoken everything elegantly and shown everything accurately, the
messenger should approach the monk and address him thus: “O sir, I have
given a clear instruction to the agent pointed out, that when your reverence
arrives there, he will clothe you with the set of robes at that time.’ The
monk desirous of getting the set should then go to the agent and tell him:
“O friend, I want a set of robes.” The agent should thus be persuaded twice
or three times and he should be reminded of the set of robes. If by
persuading and reminding the agent twice or three times he succeeds in
getting the set of robes, it is well. If he does not succeed in getting it,
let then the monk go to the agent the fourth, fifth or sixth time and wait
without speaking a word. If while silently waiting up to the fifth or sixth
time, he succeeds in getting the set, it is well. But if waiting even up to
the sixth time he does not succeed in getting the set, and then exerts
himself beyond the sixth time and succeeds in getting it, he commits a
transgression which involves Forfeiture.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="69"></a>
In case of failure to get the set of robes, let him go himself or send a
messenger to the place, whence the price came, to say: “O gentle one, be it
known to you that the price which you sent for the robes of a monk has been
of no use to him. O sir, take care that your money is not wasted.” This is
the proper course in the matter.</p>

from the Prātimokṣa-sūtra recited each half-month.</p>
<h4><span class="add">

<p><a class="sc" id="214"></a>
Whatsoever monk, when a nun not related to him is on the highway during her
visit to a village for alms, accepts from her with his own hand food, either
soft or hard, and drinks or eats it, should go to a grove outside and make a
confession to the monks thus: “O brethren, I have perpetrated a low and
unbecoming act which ought to be confessed and so do I confess it.” This is
a matter which ought to be Confessed.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="pd2">Pātidesanīya 2</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="215"></a>
When many monks invited to a layman’s house are eating, if a certain nun
staying there says: “Here give soup, here give rice, here give pulses, here
give again”, she should be exhorted by the monks thus: “Stand aside, sister,
for a while until the monks should finish eating.” If even a single monk
does not dare to exhort the nun in the above way, then all those monks going
to an outside grove should make a confession to the monks thus: “O brethren,
we have committed a low and unbecoming act which ought to be confessed and
so do we confess it.” This is a matter which ought to be Confessed.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="pd3">Pātidesanīya 3</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="216"></a>
Whatsoever monk accepts with his own hand food, either soft or hard, in a
learner’s household which has been declared by the monkhood to be under
learner’s regulations, without having been previously invited, and drinks or
eats it, should go to an outside grove and make a confession to the monks
thus: “O brethren, I have committed a low and unbecoming act which ought to
be confessed and so do I confess it.” This is a matter which ought to be
Confessed.</p>
<h4><span class="add">
<a id="pd4">Pātidesanīya 4</a>
</span></h4>
<p><a class="sc" id="217"></a>
Whatsoever monk, while he is dwelling in a hermitage situated in a region
which is solitary, insecure and beset with various dangers, accepts food,
soft or hard, of which he was not previously informed, in the outside grove
<span class="add">the life of the man who offers food being thus exposed to danger</span>
, and drinks or eats it, should go to the outside grove and make a
confession to the monks thus: “O brethren, I have committed a low and
unbecoming act which ought to be confessed and so do I confess it.” This is
a matter which ought to be Confessed.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="sc" id="218"></a>
O brethren, I have recited the four rules regarding matters which ought to
be Confessed. In this respect do I ask my brethren: “Are you perfectly pure
therein?” A second time and a third time do I ask my brethren “Are you
perfectly pure therein?” The brethren are perfectly pure therein. Therefore
they do not say anything. So do I understand.</p>

O brethren, I have recited the many rules which must be Learnt. In respect

In respect of them I ask my brethren: “Are you perfectly pure therein?” A

therein?" In this respect the brethren are perfectly pure. Therefore they do
not say anything. So do I understand.</p>

<h2><a id="conc-verse">Concluding Verses</a></h2>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="329"></a>
The Buddhas say that patience is the excellent penance<br>
and that it is the best Nirvana:<br>
he is not one gone forth who injures others,<br>
and he is not an ascetic who insults others.
<span class="gatha-number">23</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="330"></a>
Just as a person who possesses eyes<br>
and locomotion escapes all dangers,<br>
so do you avoid all transgressions in this world<br>
by leading the life of a wise man. <span class="gatha-number">24</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="331"></a>
Not to blame, not to injure,<br>
to live restrained under the law,<br>
to be moderate in eating,<br>
to sleep and sit alone<br>
and to dwell on the highest thoughts—<br>
this is indeed the teaching of the Buddhas.
<span class="gatha-number">25</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="332"></a>
Just as a bee alights on a flower<br>
and destroys not its colour nor its scent,<br>
but taking a sip departs,<br>
so let a sage dwell in his village. <span class="gatha-number">26</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="333"></a>
A sage notices neither the perversities of others<br>
nor what others do or leave undone,<br>
but he should look only to his own conduct,<br>
whether that be right or not. <span class="gatha-number">27</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="334"></a>
A person who conceives the highest thoughts,<br>
studies the fundamental characteristics of a saint,<br>
and thinks continuously of peace,<br>
attains Nirvāṇa the final repose. <span class="gatha-number">28</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="335"></a>
Merit greatly increases in one who is charitable,<br>
there is no enemy to one who is well restrained,<br>
a pious person shuns all transgressions<br>
and one whose troubles are over attains Nirvāṇa.
<span class="gatha-number">29</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="336"></a>
Not to commit any transgression,<br>
to practise virtue and to cleanse one’s mind,<br>
that is the teaching of the Buddhas. <span class="gatha-number">30</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="337"></a>
Good is the restraint of the body,<br>
the restraint in speech is good,<br>
so good is the restraint of the mind,<br>
restraint in all things is good.<br>
A monk restrained in all things is freed from sorrows.
<span class="gatha-number">31</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="338"></a>
He who guards his speech, restrains his mind<br>
and lets not these his body practice any evil—<br>
being cleansed in his activity in these three directions—<br>
attains the road preached by the sages. <span class="gatha-number">32</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="339"></a>
Vipassī the perfect seer,<br>
Sikhī the holder of a charming crest,<br>
Viśvabhu the protector of all,<br>
Krakucchanda the breaker of the chain of transmigration,<br>
Kanakamuni the golden sage,<br>
Kāśyapa the keeper of light<br>
and Śākya-muni Gautama the god of gods—<br>
these seven celebrated Lords of the universe,<br>
great Protectors and wise Heroes,<br>
taught and spread the Prātimokṣasūtra in full details.
<span class="gatha-number">33</span> <span class="gatha-number">34</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="340"></a>
It is revered by all the Buddhas and Śrāvakas.<br>
By showing reverence to it do you<br>
attain Nirvāṇa which is uncaused. <span class="gatha-number">35</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="341"></a>
Arise, commence a new course of life,<br>
turn to the religion of Buddha<br>
and subdue the army of the lord of death<br>
just as an elephant demolishes a house of reeds.
<span class="gatha-number">36</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="342"></a>
One who conscientiously practises this disciplinary doctrine,<br>
will put an end to all sufferings<br>
by avoiding the cycle of births. <span class="gatha-number">37</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="343"></a>
To help one another in keeping the moral laws<br>
and to disseminate the doctrine,<br>
this Sutra of Prātimokṣa should be recited<br>
and the cleansing of transgressions should be effected<br>
by the community of monks. <span class="gatha-number">38</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="344"></a>
Those for whom the Sutra has been recited<br>
and for whom the cleansing of transgressions has been prescribed<br>
should keep these moral laws,<br>
just as a gaur preserves its tail. <span class="gatha-number">39</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="345"></a>
Whatever merit I have achieved<br>
by reciting the Prātimokṣasūtra,<br>
by that may the entire world<br>
attain the position of the Great Sage. <span class="gatha-number">40</span></p>
