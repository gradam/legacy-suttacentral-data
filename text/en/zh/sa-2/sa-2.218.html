<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At that time one morning the nun Selā took her robes and her begging bowl and entered Sāvatthī to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she cleaned her bowl, gathered her seat <span class="supplied">for meditation</span> and went to the Andhavana forest <span class="supplied">to meditate</span>. At that time King Māra thought: “The renunciant Gotama is staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park. And there is the nun Selā who took her robes and her begging bowl and entered Sāvatthī to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she cleaned her bowl, gathered her seat and has gone to the Andhavana forest. I shall disturb her!” Having thought this he changed into a young man, approached her and spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Who is it that created beings, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>by whom were they made?<br>
Why are they called beings, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>from where do they arise?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>That time the nun Selā, having heard the verse thought: “Who is this? What a cheat! Is he a human or a non-human being?” She entered concentration and recognized he was King Māra. She answered with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Māra, you have a wrong view of ‘beings’, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>saying and believing they actually exist <span class="supplied">as substantial entities</span>.<br>
Conventional, empty they are but compounded <span class="supplied">entities</span> /<br><span class="indent">​</span>there are in fact no ‘beings.’<br>
Like when causes and various conditions /<br><span class="indent">​</span>converge and yield the use of a ‘chariot’.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>The same with aggregates (<i>khandha</i>s), elements (<i>dhātu</i>s) and spheres (<i>āyatana</i>s): /<br><span class="indent">​</span><span class="supplied">because of</span> the convergence of <span class="supplied">such</span> causes and conditions there are beings.<br>
Because of karmic conditions they assemble /<br><span class="indent">​</span>because of karmic conditions they disperse.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><span class="supplied">I have</span> cut off all craving, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the darkness of ignorance is destroyed.<br>
Having reached complete cessation. /<br><span class="indent">​</span><span class="supplied">I</span> peacefully dwell in a state of purity.<br>
Therefore understand: /<br><span class="indent">​</span>Bad One, you are defeated.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>At that time King Māra thought: “This nun knows my mind well!” Depressed, dispirited, and ashamed he returned to his palace.</p>
