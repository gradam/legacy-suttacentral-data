<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At that time the nun Kisāgotamī took her robes and her begging bowl and entered the town <span class="supplied">Sāvatthī</span> to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she cleaned her bowl, gathered her seat <span class="supplied">for meditation</span>, went into the Andhavana forest for the day’s abiding, and sat under a tree.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>At that time King Māra the Bad thought: “The renunciant Gotama is staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park, and here is this nun called Kisāgotamī. She took her robes and her begging bowl and entered Sāvatthī to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she cleaned her bowl, gathered her seat <span class="supplied">for meditation</span>, and went into the Andhavana forest, <span class="supplied">now</span> she has sat down under a tree for the day’s abiding.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Having thought this, he changed into a young man, and with the intention of disturbing her, spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“What are you doing there now /<br><span class="indent">​</span>sitting sadly under a tree,<br>
Sighing and sobbing; /<br><span class="indent">​</span>haven’t you lost a child?<br>
Dwelling alone in the forest /<br><span class="indent">​</span>aren’t you looking for a man?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>Then the nun thought: “Who is this? What a deceiver! Is he, who wants to cause confusion in me, a human or a non-human being?” She entered concentration and recognized that it was King Māra. She spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“I have cut off craving, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>I am without desire, <span class="supplied">and</span> do not think about children.<br>
Sitting upright among the trees, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>no worries, no agitations trouble me.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><span class="supplied">I have</span> cut off all craving, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the darkness of ignorance destroyed.<br>
Having reached complete cessation, /<br><span class="indent">​</span><span class="supplied">I</span> peacefully dwell in a state of purity.<br>
Therefore understand: /<br><span class="indent">​</span>Bad One you are defeated.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>At that time the Bad One thought: “The nun Kisāgotamī knows my mind well!” Depressed, dispirited, and ashamed he returned to his palace.</p>
