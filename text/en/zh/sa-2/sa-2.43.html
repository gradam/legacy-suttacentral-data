<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At that time the World-honored One said to the monks: “Once the <i>asura</i>s were gathering the four <span class="supplied">kinds of</span> armies: elephants, cavalry, chariots and infantry, all well equipped with arms. They desired to march on the palaces of the Tusita heaven, and do battle with the gods. At that time Sakka heard that the <i>asura</i>s had equipped the four armies and he told the Suvīra Devaputta: ‘I hear the <i>asura</i>s have equipped the four armies. You too now equip the four armies, march and meet them in battle!’ Suvīra answered: ‘Very well!’ Having said that, he dawdled around, had some fun, and forgot about it. When Sakka heard that the <i>asura</i>s had left their city, he ordered Suvīra again: ‘The <i>asura</i>s have left their city already. You should array the four armies and march to meet them in battle.’ Suvīra said: ‘Very well, Kosiya.’ But still Suvīra was having fun and did not prepare for battle. When the four armies of the <i>asura</i>s, in splendid formation, had arrived at Mount Sumeru and were preparing to approach <span class="supplied">the city of gods</span>, Sakka said again: ‘I hear the <i>asura</i>s are approaching. You command the four armies, go and attack them!’ Suvīra said in verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“If there is a nice and easy place without duties /<br><span class="indent">​</span>I wish to be granted this place.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Sakka replied in a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“If there were such an easy and happy place /<br><span class="indent">​</span>I would wish you to take me there with you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suvīra then spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“I am lazy, and do not want to rise; /<br><span class="indent">​</span>though I have heard and understood you, I did not equip <span class="supplied">the armies</span>.<br>
Let the splendor of the heavenly maidens and the five pleasures be all around me /<br><span class="indent">​</span>Sakka, grant me this wish.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sakka answered with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“If there were such a place of idleness /<br><span class="indent">​</span>where, surrounded by a hundred thousand heavenly maidens,<br>
One could enjoy oneself with the five pleasures: /<br><span class="indent">​</span>if you are going there, take me with you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suvīra then spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“If the king of gods has such a place without duties, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>please permit me to enjoy its happiness without suffering.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sakka answered with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“Suvīra, if you had such a place /<br><span class="indent">​</span>I would like to share its happiness with you.<br>
Have you ever seen or heard of someone who, without effort, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>attains happiness in life?<br>
If you attain such a state /<br><span class="indent">​</span>go there quickly and I will follow you.<br>
If you <span class="supplied">really</span> fear work and prefer a state of ease /<br><span class="indent">​</span>you should go and quickly attain <i>Nirvāṇa</i>!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>On hearing these words, Suvīra gathered the four armies and set out to meet the <i>asura</i>s in battle. At that time the <i>deva</i>s were victorious and the <i>asura</i>s retreated. Having repelled the <i>asura</i>s, <span class="supplied">the <i>deva</i>s</span> returned to their palaces in splendid formation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>The Buddha said to the monks: “Sakka is the king of <i>deva</i>s and has attained great power. If even he makes efforts, and praises making efforts, how could you, who out of faith have left home and donned the robes, how could you not make diligent efforts and praise making efforts. To make efforts and to praise making efforts, this should be the way of those who have left home.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>When the Buddha had finished speaking, the monks, having heard what he had said, were happy and remembered it well.</p>
