<h3>Bhikkhu Saṃyutta</h3>
<h1>The parable of the smoking burrow</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying in Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove of Kalanda.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At that time a monk went to the river in the early morning hours, undressed, and bathed. When he came out to dry his body on the riverside, there was a <i>deva</i> there, emitting rays and illuminating the riverbank. The <i>deva</i> addressed him <span class="supplied">with a riddle</span> saying: “Monk! There is a burrow, from which smoke arises at night, but which is ablaze with fire during the day. A <i>brāhmaṇa</i> having seen this, <span class="supplied">had it</span> broken open and dug up. There was a clever man <span class="supplied">doing the digging</span>, who told the <i>brāhmaṇa</i>: ‘Digging with the blade I found a tortoise’ And the <i>brāhmaṇa</i> said: ‘Bring this tortoise out!’ Again he said: ‘Digging up the ground I found a viper,’and <span class="supplied">the <i>brāhmaṇa</i></span> ordered him to catch it. Again he said: ‘Digging up the ground I found a piece of meat,’ and <span class="supplied">the <i>brāhmaṇa</i></span> ordered him to pull it out. Again he said: ‘Digging up the ground I found a slaughter-house.’ The <i>brāhmaṇa</i> said: ‘This is a slaughter-house’ and ordered him to take it out. Again he said: ‘Digging up the ground I found the <i>laṅgiman</i> poisonous insects,’ and <span class="supplied">the <i>brāhmaṇa</i></span> ordered him to dig them out. Again he said: ‘Digging up the ground I found a forked path,’ and <span class="supplied">the <i>brāhmaṇa</i> said:</span> ‘Out with it!’. Again he said: ‘Further digging up the ground I found a heap of stones’ and <span class="supplied">the <i>brāhmaṇa</i></span> ordered him to take out the stones. Again he said: ‘Digging up the ground I found a cobra.’ The <i>brāhmaṇa</i> said: ‘Do not disturb it’ and knelt before the cobra.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>The <i>deva</i> said to the monk: “Don’t forget my words! Ask the Buddha <span class="supplied">about this</span> and remember all he says! Why? Because I see no-one, whether <i>deva</i>, demon, or <i>brahmā</i> with the ability to analyse this, no-one who could explain this riddle, but the Buddha and his disciples, the monks.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Then the monk went to the Buddha, paid homage at his feet and stood to one side. He told the Buddha what the <i>deva</i> had said <span class="supplied">and asked:</span> “World-honored One! What is this burrow that emits smoke at night and is on fire at day? Who is the <i>brāhmaṇa</i>? Who is the clever person? What is the blade? What does it mean ‘to dig’? What is the tortoise? What is the viper? What the piece of meat? What the slaughter-house? What the <i>laṅgiman</i> poisonous insects? What the forked path? What the heap of stones? What is the cobra?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>The Buddha replied: “Listen carefully! Listen carefully! I will tell you. The burrow is the body. Conceived through the essences of father and mother, made up from the four elements, sustained by clothing and food: by these a body comes to be. But in the end the body will fail, swell up, become worm-eaten and break up. The smoke that arises at night is the various kinds of thoughts. The fire of the day is the karma engendered by body and speech. The <i>brāhmaṇa</i> is the <i>Tathāgata</i>. The clever man is the disciple (<i>sāvaka</i>). The blade is a metaphor for wisdom, and digging means diligent effort. The tortoise stands for the five hindrances, the viper for hatred and harming. The piece of meat means stinginess, greed and jealousy. The slaughter-house is the five sensual pleasures. The <i>laṅgiman</i> poisonous insects are a metaphor for ignorance, and the forked path stands for doubt. The stones are for arrogance, and the cobra is the <i>Arahat</i>, who has ended all bonds of becoming <span class="supplied">that lead to rebirth</span>.”</p>
<p>Then the Buddha spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“A burrow is the body /<br><span class="indent">​</span>coarse and subtle thought is the smoke,<br>
deeds are like the fire /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the brāhmaṇa is the <i>Tathāgata</i>,<br>
the clever person is the <i>sāvaka</i> /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the blade is wisdom,<br>
digging stands for diligent effort /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the five hindrances are like the tortoise,<br>
hatred is like the viper /<br><span class="indent">​</span>greed and jealousy are like the piece of meat,<br>
the five sensual pleasures are like the slaughter-house /<br><span class="indent">​</span>stupidity is like the bar,<br>
Doubt is like the forked path /<br><span class="indent">​</span>belief in a self like the heap of stones.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>But do not disturb the cobra /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the cobra is the true Arahat<br>
To answer these questions well /<br><span class="indent">​</span>is only for the Buddha, the World-honored One.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>When the Buddha had finished speaking, the monks, having listened to what he had said, were happy and remembered it well.</p>
