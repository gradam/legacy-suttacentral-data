<p>Sakka Saṃyutta</p>
<h1>Sakka is patient in the face of insult</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At that time the World-honored One told the monks: “A long time ago, Sakka Devānaṃ Inda was about to do battle with the <i>asura</i>s. When everything had been readied, he addressed the gods: “If we gods should attain victory, we will bind <span class="supplied">the king of the</span> <i>asura</i>s with five bonds, and bring him to our palace.” The <i>asura</i> <span class="supplied">king</span> also addressed his host: “If we win, we also will bind Sakka Devānaṃ Inda with five bonds and bring him to the <i>asura</i> palace.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>At that time, the gods won, and they bound Vepacitti with five bonds and brought him to their palace. When Vepacitti saw Sakka, he became angry and insulted him, using extremely foul language. When Sakka heard these insults, he stayed silent, did not react. His charioteer Mātali addressed him with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Sakka! Husband of Sujā! Maghavā! /<br><span class="indent">​</span>Are you afraid? Are you weak?<br>
Vepacitti insults you to your face: /<br><span class="indent">​</span>how can you suffer this foul language?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Sakka answered with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“I let patience arise not because I am afraid /<br><span class="indent">​</span>neither is it that I am weak<br>
And therefore suffer Vepacitti’s insults /<br><span class="indent">​</span>By my own superior wisdom I have practiced patience.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>The foolish person, being of shallow knowledge, lacking wisdom, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>constantly argues, quarreling without end.<br>
If I use force to control him, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>then I am not different from this fool.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again the charioteer said:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“If one loosens the bonds of the naïve and foolish /<br><span class="indent">​</span>they will just go on and on.<br><span class="supplied">They are</span> like a cow walking behind /<br><span class="indent">​</span><span class="supplied">that suddenly</span> tries to stampede over those in front of it<br>
A firm one will forcefully /<br><span class="indent">​</span>restrain the foolish.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again Sakka spoke in verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“I find that for restraining the foolish /<br><span class="indent">​</span>there is nothing better than patient silence.<br>
When someone has intense hatred and anger /<br><span class="indent">​</span>he is best restrained by patience alone.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>What the foolish call strength /<br><span class="indent">​</span>is really lack of strength.<br>
The foolish do not distinguish between good and bad; /<br><span class="indent">​</span>they have no way to restrain <span class="supplied">themselves</span>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>If I can find the courage in me /<br><span class="indent">​</span>to patiently endure the foolish and inferior,<br>
then this is called ‘foremost patience,’ /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and ‘skill in patience.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>A weak person when facing someone strong /<br><span class="indent">​</span>cannot but practice <span class="supplied">patience</span>:<br>
this is called ‘timid patience,’ /<br><span class="indent">​</span>it is not true patience.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>Those with great strength have the freedom /<br><span class="indent">​</span>to counter those who insult <span class="supplied">them</span><br>
with silence, not reacting: /<br><span class="indent">​</span>this is called ‘supreme patience.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>Weakness is afraid of power /<br><span class="indent">​</span>it is silent <span class="supplied">because</span> it cannot react.<br>
This is called ‘fear,’ /<br><span class="indent">​</span>not ‘practicing patience.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a>The naïve and foolish, those without wisdom /<br><span class="indent">​</span>afflict others by harming them.<br>
Seeing the other’s silent patience /<br><span class="indent">​</span>they believe they are victorious.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a>A wise and saintly person /<br><span class="indent">​</span>knows that patience is victorious.<br>
Thus, among the saintly /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the meritorious power of patience is always praised.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a>Not only for oneself but also for the other, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>one does away with hindrances and fears.<br>
Seeing the other full of hatred and anger, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>yet being able to practice silent patience,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a>the other’s hatred will vanish naturally, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>no need for the power of knife and cudgel.<br>
For the great benefit of both, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>benefiting oneself and benefiting others.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a>What the foolish deem patience out of fear /<br><span class="indent">​</span>is praised by the wise and saintly.<br>
We are patient with those superior to us /<br><span class="indent">​</span>because we are afraid of being harmed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a>Also when struggling with equals /<br><span class="indent">​</span>one is patient because one fears harm.<br>
The ability to be patient with those inferior to us /<br><span class="indent">​</span>is the highest form of patience.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a>The Buddha told the monks: “If Sakka in the heaven of the thirty-three, freely exercising his rulership, can practice and praise patience, how much more should you, monks, who have disfigured yourselves <span class="supplied">by shaving off your hair</span> and entered the teaching, how much more should you practice and praise patience! Practicing and praising patience is the way of <span class="supplied">those who have gone forth into</span> homelessness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a>When the Buddha had finished, the monks, having listened to what he had said, were happy and remembered it well.</p>
