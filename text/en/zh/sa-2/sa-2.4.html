<span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying
at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, the Anāthapiṇḍika Park. At that time, when
the hour to go on almsround had come, a number of monks put on their robes,
took their begging bowls and entered the town to beg for food. There the
monks heard that the monk “Elephant-head,” a member of the Sakya clan, had
fallen ill in the town and died. Having finished the meal they returned,
went to the Buddha, paid homage at his feet and sat to one side. They said
to the Buddha: “World-honored One, this morning we put on our robes, took
our begging bowls and entered the town to beg for food. There we heard that
the monk “Elephant-head” had died. May the World-honored One explain to us
where the monk “Elephant-head” will be reborn, what karmic fruit he will
obtain.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
The Buddha said to the monks: “Those that cause the three negative factors
to increase must, after the body fails and life comes to an end, fall into
hell. What are the three negative factors? They are known as the increase of
greed, of ignorance and of hate. Now this monk was guilty of the three
negative factors. Understand, monks, that he will fall into hell.”</p>
<p>At that time the Buddha spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“If one gives rise to an unwholesome mind / <br>
<span class="indent">​</span>developing greed, hatred, and ignorance, <br>
(and) does evil with one’s body /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>one will harm oneself, <br>
just as the banana plant when bearing fruit /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span> harms its own body <br>
The absence of greed, hatred and ignorance /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span> is called wisdom.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
Those who do not harm their own bodies / <br>
<span class="indent">​</span>are called victors. <br>
Therefore, one should cut off /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>the great suffering of greed, hatred, and
ignorance.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
There the monks, having listened to what the Buddha had said, were happy
and remembered it well.</p>
