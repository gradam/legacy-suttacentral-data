<h1>Seven Practices</h1>

<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At that time the Buddha told the monks: “Steadfastly maintaining the seven practices one is bound to be reborn as <span class="supplied">a</span> Sakka <span class="supplied">king of gods</span>. Why so? In former times, when <span class="supplied">any</span> Sakka was a human being, he set out to cultivate these beginner’s practices. He was obedient to his parents and respectful to the elders of the <span class="supplied">extended clan-</span>family. His speech was gentle. He did not slander others. He was generous, not stingy. He always told the truth, never betrayed others. He did not let anger arise, and whenever hatred arose in him, he strove to extinguish it quickly.”</p>
<p>At that time the World-honored One spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“<span class="supplied">Whoever</span> towards their parents /<br><span class="indent">​</span>displays filial obedience,<br>
towards their elders /<br><span class="indent">​</span>heartfelt deep respect,<br>
always speaks in a manner gentle and friendly, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>kindly and good,<br>
abandoning slander, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>greed, and hatred,<br><span class="supplied">of such a one</span> the thirty-three gods /<br><span class="indent">​</span>have this to say:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Such a practitioner /<br><span class="indent">​</span>is our better.<br>
He should dwell apart /<br><span class="indent">​</span>as king of the gods.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>When the Buddha had finished speaking, the monks, having heard what he had said, were happy and remembered it well.</p>
