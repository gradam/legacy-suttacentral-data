<h3>Māra Saṃyutta</h3>
<h1>Māra disturbs a teaching on impermanence</h1>

<span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying
<span class="supplied">north of</span> Rājagaha in the Sītavana forest. At
that time the Buddha told the monks: “Human life is short, it is bound to
end. You should make an effort to follow the path and practice in purity and
celibacy. Therefore do not be lazy; practice right conduct. You should train
yourselves in the <span class="supplied">right</span> meaning of the
<i>Dhamma</i> and true conduct.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
At that time the Demon King Māra, having heard what was said, thought: “The
renunciant Gotama is expounding the principles of the <i>Dhamma</i> for his
disciples in the Sītavana forest at Rājagaha. I should go there and disturb
them.” Having thought thus, he transformed himself into a young man and went
to the Buddha. He paid homage at his feet and stood to one side. Then he
spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“Human life is long / <br>
<span class="indent">​</span>without any cares or worries. <br>
<span class="supplied">For those</span> always at ease / <br>
<span class="indent">​</span>there is no path for death.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
The Buddha thought: “Māra the Bad has come to confuse and disturb us.” And
he spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
“Human life hurries quickly away / <br>
<span class="indent">​</span>filled with confusion and trouble; <br>
make haste to practice the good /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>as if your head were on fire, <br>
and know the Bad One /<br>
<span class="indent">​</span>has come to disturb.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
Then King Māra, having heard the verse, thought: “The renunciant Gotama
knows my intentions.” And he became depressed and dispirited and felt deep
regret. He made himself invisible and returned to his heavenly palace.</p>
