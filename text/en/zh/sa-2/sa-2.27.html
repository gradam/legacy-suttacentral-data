<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on Gijjhakūṭa Mountain. The sky was covered with clouds. It rained lightly and lightning flashed brightly everywhere. At that time the World-honored One was walking in the open at night. There King Māra the Bad had this thought: “The renunciant Gotama is staying in Rājagaha on Gijjhakūṭa Mountain; the sky is covered with clouds, it is raining lightly, and lightning is flashing brightly everywhere. While he is walking in the open at night, I should go and disturb him.” Having thought thus, King Māra went up that mountain and pushed a large boulder down to hit the Buddha. The boulder <span class="supplied">however</span> shattered by itself. At that time the World-honored One spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“You <span class="supplied">might</span> destroy Gijjhakūṭa Mountain /<br><span class="indent">​</span>turn it to dust;<br><span class="supplied">you might</span> break apart /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the vast continents and the immense ocean.<br><span class="supplied">However,</span> to inspire fear /<br><span class="indent">​</span>in someone who has attained true liberation,<br>
to make his hair stand on end /<br><span class="indent">​</span>will never be possible.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>At that time King Māra thought: “The renunciant Gotama knows my thoughts.” He became depressed and dispirited, made his body invisible and returned to his heavenly palace.</p>
