<h1>2.70 Long Bone</h1>
</div>
<p>The king asked Nāgasena again, “Your sramanas say that there are bones as long as four thousand li. What kind of animal would have bones four thousand li long?”</p>
<p>Nāgasena said, “Have you, O great king, heard that in the sea, there is a kind of large fish called a zhi, whose body is 28,000 li long?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have heard of such fish.”</p>
<p>“Yes, if there is a kind of fish whose body is about 28,000 li long, then its ribs are four thousand li long. Are you, great king, still surprised?”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
