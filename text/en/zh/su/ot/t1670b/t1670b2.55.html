<h1>2.55 Relation Between the Buddha and Brahman</h1>
</div>
<p>The king asked Nāgasena again, “Is the Buddha’s conduct similar to the Brahman, the king of the seventh heaven, having no intercourse with women (brahmacariya)?”</p>
<p>Nāgasena replied, “Yes, the Buddha keeps away from women, so he is pure without any defilement.”</p>
<p>“If the Buddha’s conduct is the same as that of the conduct of the Brahman, the king of the seventh heaven, then the Buddha is a follower of Brahman, the king of the seventh heaven.”</p>
<p>“But does Brahman, the king of the seventh heaven, have thoughts [buddhi]?”</p>
<p>“Yes Brahman, the king of the seventh heaven, has thoughts.”</p>
<p>“Then Brahman, the king of the seventh heaven, and the higher heavens all should be the followers of the Buddha.”</p>
<p>Nāgasena asked the king, “What is the cry of a bird like?”</p>
<p>“A bird’s cry is like the cry of a wild goose.”</p>
<p>Then Nāgasena said, “If so, birds are the disciples of wild geese. But in fact, they are of two different kinds. It is the same with regard to the Buddha, he is not the disciple of Brahman king of the seventh heaven.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
