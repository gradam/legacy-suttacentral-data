<h2><a id="ms0" href="#toc">Talk on Wanderers</a></h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> The Buddha once, when going on a tour through Magadha country with a great company of monks, with about one thousand and two hundred fifty monks, arrived at Veluvana. And there he put up at the royal rest-house to pass the night.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Now at the same time, there was a wanderer named Suppiya. The youth Brahmādatta was his pupil. Both teacher and pupil always went together, followed step by step after the Buddha and the company of monks. But, while the wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, his pupil, the youth Brahmādatta spoke in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. So do these two, teacher and pupil, follow step by step after the Buddha, making assertions in direct contradiction to one another. Why is it so? This is because that they have different views, follow different discipline, and have different association with different people.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>Now, a number of monks, after begging for alms, assembled in the hall and this was the trend of their talk: “It is wonderful and marvelous, how the Exalted One, he who has miraculous power and full of respect-inspiring virtue, has so thoroughly penetrated the diversity in the dispositions of beings. For this wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, while his pupil, the youth Brahmādatta spoke in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. So do these two, teacher and pupil, follow step by step after the Buddha and the company of monks, making assertions in direct contradiction to one another. This is because they have different views, follow different discipline, and have different association with different people.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Now the Blessed One in the abode of meditation, on hearing what was the drift of their talk through the divine ear which is superior to human ear, rose up from meditation, and went to the preaching hall; and there he took his seat in front of monks. Although, being aware of what those monks were talking, the Buddha deliberately asked: “O, monks. What was the reason that caused all of you to gather here in this hall? What was the subject of your conversation?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>Then the bhiksus replied: “After begging our alms, we assembled in this preaching hall. As we sat here, the following conversation sprang up among us: ‘It is wonderful and marvelous, how the Tathagata, who has miraculous power and full of respect-inspiring virtue, has so thoroughly penetrated the diversity in the dispositions of beings. For this wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, while his pupil, the youth Brahmādatta, spoke in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. So do these two, teacher and pupil, follow step by step after the Buddha and the company of monks, making assertions in direct contradiction to one another. Why is it so? This is because they have different views, different habits, and different association with different people.’ That is why we have gathered here in this preaching hall in order to discuss such a thing.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>Then the Buddha told bhiksus: “O, monks. If anyone, in as many ways, should speak in dispraise of me, of the Dharma, or of the Sangha, you should not give way to resentment, displeasure, or animosity against them in your heart. Why? For if you were to become angry or upset in such a situation, you would only be standing in the way of your self-conquest. Therefore, you should not give way to resentment, displeasure, or animosity against them in your heart.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><span class="dquo">“</span>And if, monks, others speak in praise of me, or in praise of the Dharma, or in praise of the Sangha, you should not give way to jubilation, joy, and exultation in your heart. Why? For if you were to become jubilant, joyful, and exultant in such a situation, you would only be standing in the way of your self-conquest. Therefore, you should not give way to jubilation, joy, and exultation in your heart. Why? It is only to trifling and insignificant matters, to the minor details of mere moral virtue, that the worldling who knows too little to comprehend their deep and subtle meanings would refer when speaking in accordance with what he has directly seen through his eyes in praise of the Tathagata.</p>

And what are these dharmas, deep, difficult to understand, peaceful and sublime, beyond the sphere of reasoning, subtle, comprehensible only to the wise, and about which the wise disciple would rightly praise the Tathagata in accordance with reality would speak?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="53"></a>There are some recluses and Brahmāns (who are speculators about the past and the future), who hold settled views about the past and the future, and who on sixty-two grounds assert various conceptual theorems referring to the past and the future.

And he says: ‘The self and the world are eternal, steadfast, barren. And though these beings roam and wander through the round of existence, pass away and re-arise, yet the self and the world remains the same just like eternity itself. Why so?

And though beings roam and wander through the round of existence, pass away and re-arise, yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself.

<p><a class="sc" id="61"></a>This, only the Tathagata understands: These viewpoints, thus grasped and such adhered to, lead to such a future destination, to such a state in the world beyond. He understands as well what transcends this, yet even that understanding he is not attached to. And being thus unattached he has realized within himself the state of perfect peace, and having understood as they really are the arising and passing away of feelings, their sweet taste, their danger, and the escape from them, the Tathagata is liberated through non-clinging.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="64"></a>There are some recluses and Brahmāns who are eternalists in regard to some things, and non-eternalists in regard to other things, and who on four grounds proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly non-eternal. It is in this way, the one of four grounds, that some recluses and Brahmāns who are eternalists in regard to some things, and non-eternalists in regard to other things, proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly non-eternal.</p>
<p class="P4"><a class="sc" id="65"></a>There comes a time, sooner or later after the lapse of a long period, when this world-system begins to expand, a certain being, due to the exhaustion of his blessing, the exhaustion of his life-span, or the exhaustion of his merit, passes away from the Heaven of Streaming Radiance and re-arises in the empty Palace of Brahmā. There he alone dwells.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="66"></a>Then, as a result of dwelling there all alone for so long a time, there arises in him, a dissatisfaction and a longing. So he makes a wish: ‘O! would that other beings might come to join me in this place!’ And just then, either because of their span of life had passed or their merit was exhausted, other beings pass away from the Heaven of Streaming Radiance and re-arise in the empty palace of Brahmā as companions to him. And then, the being who was first reborn thinks thus to himself: ‘I am Brahmā, the Great Brahmā here in this place. I came into existence without rhyme or reason. There is no one who can create me. I am the Universal Seer, the All-seeing, the Almighty. I am God, the Supreme One, the subtle Maker, the Creator, and the father of all that are and are to be. I am the one who came into existence first. All these beings re-arose here after me. And these beings who re-arose here later all have been created by me.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="67"></a>And the beings who re-arose there after him also think: ‘He is the Great Brahmā. He himself can create; and there is no one who can create him. He is the Universal Seer, the All-seeing, the Almighty. He is God, the Supreme Being, the subtle Maker and Creator. He is the father of all of us. He is the only one who came into existence first. We all came after him; and we all were created by him.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="68"></a>Now, this comes to pass, that a certain being, due to exhaustion of his life-span or the exhaustion of merit, passes away from that world and takes rebirth in this world. After growing up, he shaves his head and puts on robes, thus goes forth from household life into homelessness. When he has gone forth, by means of endeavour and diligence, etc., he attains to such a state of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life. He speaks thus: ‘The Great Brahmā who can create himself, and there is no one who can create him. He is the Almighty, the All-seeing, the Universal Seer, God, the Supreme Being, the Subtle Maker, the Creator, and the Father of all beings. He is permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change, and he will remain the same just like eternity itself. But we who have been created by him and have come hither as being impermanent, unstable, doomed to perish, short-lived.’ That’s why we know that the self and 
the world are partly eternal and partly non-eternal. This (the Great Brahmā) is permanent, eternal, stable, and all others are impermanent, unstable.’ This is the first case. It is in this way, on the one of four grounds, that some recluses and Brahmāns who hold a settled view about the past, proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly non-eternal.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="69"></a>There are certain gods called “corrupted by pleasures.” For ages they pass their time in the pursuit of laughter and sport of sensual lust. As a consequence they become weary in their body and then lose their self-control. When they lose their self-control, they pass away from that plane and take rebirth in this world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="70"></a>After growing up, he shaves his head and puts on robes, thus goes forth from the household life into homelessness. When he has gone forth, by means of endeavour and diligence, etc., he attains to such a state of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life. He speaks thus: ‘Those gods who are not corrupted by pleasures do not spend an excessive time indulging in the delights of laughter and play. As a consequence they do not pass away from that plane, but remain there for ever and ever. Those gods are permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change. But we were gods corrupted by play. Because we spent an excessive time indulging in the delights of laughter and play, and as a consequence we are now impermanent, unstable, short-lived, doomed to perish. Therefore, I know that the self and the world are partly eternal and partly non-eternal. This (those who are not corrupted by play) is permanent, stable, eternal, and others 
(as we were corrupted by play) are impermanent, unstable, non-eternal.’ This is the second case. It is in this way, on the one of four grounds, those recluses and Brahmāns who are eternalists in regard to some things, and non-eternalists in regard to other things, proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly non-eternal.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="71"></a>There are certain gods contemplate on each other with excessive envy. As a consequence they lose their self-control, and when they lose their self-control they pass away from that plane and take rebirth in this world. After growing up, he shaves his head and puts on robes, thus goes forth from the household life into homelessness. When he has gone forth, by means of endeavour and diligence, etc., he attains to such a state of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life. He speaks thus: ‘Those gods who are not corrupted by mind do not contemplate on each other with excessive envy. As a result, they do not lose their self-control, and they do not pass away from that plane, but remain there for ever and ever. Those gods are permanent, stable, not subject to change. But we contemplated on each other with excessive envy, and as a result we lose our self-control, and consequently we passed away from that plane. Coming to this 
world, now we are impermanent, unstable, short-lived, doomed to perish. Owing to this, I know that the self and the world are partly eternal and partly non-eternal. This is eternal permanent, stable, and others are impermanent, unstable.’ This is the third case. It is in this way, on the one of four grounds, those recluses and Brahmāns proclaim that the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly non-eternal.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="72"></a>Herein, some recluse or Brahmān who is sharp-witted, quick in thought and good at logic and reasoning. Hammering out by reason, deducing from his investigations, following his own flight of thought, he declares his view thus: ‘The self and the world are partly eternal and partly non-eternal. They are permanent, steadfast, eternal, not subject to change, and others are impermanent, unstable, not eternal, subject to change.’ This is the fourth case. It is in this way, on the one of four grounds, that those recluses and Brahmāns proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly non-eternal.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="73"></a>It is on these four grounds, that those recluses and Brahmāns who are partial-eternalists proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly non-eternal. Whatever recluses and Brahmāns there may be who proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly non-eternal, all of them do so on these four grounds, or on a certain one of them. Outside of these there is none.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="74"></a>Only the Tathagata understands: ‘These standpoints, thus grasped and thus adhered to, will lead to such a future destination, to such a state in the world beyond. Tathagata understands as well what transcends this, yet even that understanding he does not attach to. And because he is free from attachment, he has realized within himself the state of perfect peace.

And what are these dharmas?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="86"></a>There are some recluses and Brahmāns who wriggle like eels; and when a question is put to them on this or that they resort to equivocation, to eel-wriggling, and this in four ways. Therefore, some recluses and Brahmāns who wriggle like eels, resort to equivocation, to eel-wriggling on four grounds, when a question is put to them on this or that.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="87"></a>Therein, some recluse or Brahmāns makes thus a statement, holds thus a view: ‘I do neither see nor understand whether there will be a wholesome result after performing a wholesome action or there will be an unwholesome result after performing an unwholesome action. For I do neither see nor understand whether there will be a wholesome result after performing a wholesome action or there will be an unwholesome result after performing an unwholesome action, so that I thus say I do neither declare there will be a wholesome result after performing a wholesome action nor there will be an unwholesome result after performing an unwholesome action.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="88"></a>There are some recluse or Brahmān who is erudite and well-heard, wise, clever, experienced in controversy, and respected by the world. He is good at distinguishing any viewpoint. He thinks: ‘when I be questioned about the profundity of this or that point, I might not be able to reply. If I could not reply, that would distress me, and that distress would be an obstacle for me. Therefore, out of fear and loathing of being distressed, I have to answer in this way, as my refuge, as my island, as my house, as my path of deliverance. So when someone put a question to me on this or that, I should answer like this: “I do not take it thus, nor do I take it in that way, nor do I take it in some other way. I do not say that it is not, nor do I say that is neither this nor that.” This is the first case. It is in this way, on the one of four grounds, that those recluses and Brahmāns resort to evasive statement and to endless equivocation, when questioned about this or that.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="89"></a>Therein some recluse or Brahmān makes thus a statement, holds thus a view: ‘I do neither see nor understand whether there is a world beyond or there is no such a world beyond.’ There are some recluse or Brahmān who can see things far beyond with his divine eye and read others mind, when I come close to him, he is not seen by me. Such a person understands whether there is a world beyond or there is no such a world beyond. But I do neither see nor understand whether there is a world beyond or there is no such a world beyond. If, without understanding, I were to declare there is to be a world beyond or there is to be no world beyond, my declaration might be false, that would distress me. Therefore, out of fear and loathing of making a false statement, I take this as my refuge, as my island, as my house, and as my path of deliverance. So, when someone puts a question to me on this or that, I should answer like this: ‘I do not take it thus, nor do I take it in that way, nor do I take 
it in some other way. I do not say that it is not, nor do I say that it is neither this nor that.’ This is the second case. It is in this way, on the one of the four grounds, that those recluses and Brahmāns resort to evasive statement and to the endless equivocation, when questioned about this or that.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="90"></a>Herein, some recluse or Brahmān makes thus a statement, holds thus a view: ‘I do not see or understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesome. If without seeing or understanding, I were to declare something to be wholesome or unwholesome, desire and lust or hatred and aversion might arise in me. Under these circumstances, desire and lust or hatred and aversion might cause a rebirth. In order to eliminate the pain of remorse, I go forth from the household life into the homelessness. Therefore, out of fear and loathing of the falling into that state, (he does not declare anything to be wholesome or unwholesome), he takes this as his refuge, as his island, as his house, and as his path of deliverance. But when some one puts a question to him on this or that, he resort to evasive statements and to endless equivocation, and he answers like this: ‘I do not take it thus, nor do I take it in that way, nor do I take it in some other way. I do not say that it is not, nor 
do I say that it is neither this nor that.’ This is the third case. It is in this way, on the one of four grounds, that those recluses and Brahmāns resort to evasive statements and to endless equivocation, when questioned about this or that.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="91"></a>Herein, some recluse or Brahmān is dull and stupid. Due to his dullness and stupidity, when he is questioned about this or that point, he does the same as others do—resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation: ‘I do not take it thus, nor do I take it in that way, nor do I take it in some other way. I do not say that it is not, nor do I say that it is neither this nor that.’ This is the fourth case.

It is from these, namely, different believing, different desires, different hearings, different conditioning causes, different realizations, different perceptions, different concentrations, and different endurance, that those who get knowledge. Whatever opinion of theirs, is all based only on the personal sensations, feelings. … And when those recluses and Brahmāns who maintain a doctrine of nirvana here and now proclaim on five grounds nirvana here and now for a living being—that too is based only on the personal sensations, feelings.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="173"></a>Therein, when those recluses and Brahmāns who are eternalists proclaim on four grounds the self and the world to be eternal—that is only the feeling of those who do not know and do not see; that is only the agitation and vacillation of those who are immersed in craving. … And when those recluses and Brahmāns who maintain a doctrine of nirvana here and now proclaim on five grounds nirvana here and now for a living being—that too is only the feeling of those who do not know and do not see; that is only the agitation and vacillation of those who are immersed in craving.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="174"></a>Therein, when those recluses and brhmans who are eternalists about the past, and who hold settled views about the past proclaim on four grounds the self and the world to be eternal—that is conditioned by contact. That they can experience that feeling without contact—such a case is impossible. … And when those recluses and Brahmāns who maintain a doctrine of nirvana here and now proclaim on five grounds nirvana here and now for a living being—that too is conditioned by contact.

<p><a class="sc" id="175"></a>Whatever recluses or Brahmāns, bhiksus, are speculators about the past, speculators about the future, speculators about the past and the future together, hold settled views about the past and the future, and assert various conceptual theorems referring to the past and the future, all of them, are entrapped in the net of these sixty-two divisions. Whatever this way or that way they plunge about, they are in it. Whatever this way or that way they may flounder, they are included in it, caught in it.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="176"></a>Just as a skillful fisherman should drag a tiny pool of water with a fine-meshed net he might fairly think: ‘Whatever fish or size may be in this pond, every one will be in this net; flounder about as they may, they will be included in it, and caught’—just so is it with these recluses and Brahmāns who are speculators about the past and the future, hold settled views about the past and the future, and assert various conceptual theorems referring to the past and the future, all are entrapped in the net of these sixty-two divisions, flounder as they may, they are included and caught.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="177"></a><span class="dquo">“</span>When, monks, a bhiksu understands as they really are the origin and passing away of the six bases of contact, their satisfaction, unsatisfactoriness, and escape from them, then he understands what transcends all these views.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="178"></a>The Tathagata knows himself that the repeated birth and death is no more for him. The body of the Tathagata stands, just for the sake of teaching Dharma to those gods and men. If he stands without the outward form, those gods and men shall have nothing to behold. Just as, when the head of Tala tree has been cut, it can not grow any more—in the same way, having escaped from the cycle of birth and death, the Buddha will not be reborn any more.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="179"></a>As this discourse being spoken by the Buddha, the ten thousandfold world-system shook in six sorts of sake for three times.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="180"></a>When he had thus spoken, the venerable Ānanda, having held a fan fanning the Buddha behind him, coming to the front with one shoulder uncovered, putting his palms together on banded knees, said to the Buddha: “It is wonderful and marvelous! What is the title, Lord, of this exposition of the Dharma?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="181"></a>The Buddha told him: “ Ānanda, you may remember this exposition of the Dharma as the Atthacara, as the Dharmacara, as the Diṭṭhicara, as the Māracara, and as the Brahmācara.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="182"></a>On hearing thus, the Buddha spoke, the venerable Ānanda delighted and rejoiced greatly, believed and accepted the teachings.</p>
