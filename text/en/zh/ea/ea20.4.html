<span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was
staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then the
Exalted One said to the bhikṣus:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“Now it is apposite for me to say
<span class="supplied">the following</span>—there are persons who are like
lions and those who are like sheep. Listen attentively and take heed (
<i lang="pi">śṛṇuta ca suṣṭhu ca manasi-kuruta</i>) of what
<span class="supplied">I am going to say</span>.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“We shall, Exalted One,” replied the bhikṣus.
<span class="supplied">In order to</span> instruct them, the Exalted One
went on:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“How does a person resemble a lion? There is
<span class="supplied">, for example,</span> a bhikṣu, someone who receives
what is respectfully offered (<i lang="pi">satkāra</i>): robes, alms-food (
<i lang="pi">piṇḍapāta</i>), lodging (<i lang="pi">śayanāsana</i>) and
medicine for treating the sick. Having received and then enjoying (
<i lang="pi">pari-</i>√<i lang="pi">bhuj</i>) them, attachment does not
arise in his mind; neither thoughts of desire arise in him nor any
<span class="supplied">wrong</span> perception. Not
<span class="supplied">entertaining</span> any
<span class="supplied">wrong</span> ideas whatsoever, he is absolutely
certain about the Teaching (<i lang="pi">dharma</i>) conducive to
emancipation (<i lang="pi">nairyāṇika</i>). Even if he has to go without
gains and favours (<i lang="pi">lābhasatkāra</i>), he is neither distracted
( <i lang="pi">vikṣipta</i>) nor does he experience elation and dejection.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
“<span class="supplied">He is</span> like the royal lion
<span class="supplied">whenever the latter has</span> to make do with a
small domestic animal <span class="supplied">as prey</span>. At that time
the king of beasts, too, does not think like this: ‘This is good, that is
bad.’ Attachment does not arise in his mind: neither thoughts of desire
arise in him nor <span class="supplied">wrong</span> perception. Similar is
<span class="supplied">the behaviour of</span> this person: Whenever he
receives respectful offerings … attachment does not arise in his mind. Even
if he does not receive anything, he does not entertain any
<span class="supplied">wrong</span> ideas.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
“Take for example someone who receives what people respectfully offer him:
robes, alms-food, lodging, help and medicine for the sick. Having received
and then enjoying them, attachment arises in his mind; thoughts of sensuous
desire (<i lang="pi">kāmarāga</i>) arise in him and he is absolutely
oblivious of the path leading to emancipation. Should he receive nothing, he
does not stop fretting. Having received respectful offerings, however, he
boasts of himself and insults the other bhikṣus
<span class="supplied">by saying</span>: ‘It is me who is fit (
<i lang="pi">samartha</i>) to receive robes … medicine for the sick, whereas
these bhikṣus are not.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>
“<span class="supplied">Let us take</span> the simile of that single sheep
in the midst of a large flock of sheep. Having separated itself from the
flock, that sheep went to a large heap of dung. Having feasted on the faeces
at a distance from the flock, it returned to it and, boasting of itself,
<span class="supplied">it insulted the other sheep by saying</span>: ‘I am
fit to receive excellent food, these sheep are not.’ Similarly, whenever the
<span class="supplied">second type of</span> person receives gains and
favours, robes … medicine for the sick, he loses his composure and
attachment arises in his mind; then he boasts of himself
<span class="supplied">while insulting</span> the
<span class="supplied">other</span> bhikṣus
<span class="supplied">by saying</span>: ‘I am fit to receive
<a class="t" id="tT2_600a"></a>
respectful offerings, these bhikṣus are not.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>
“Therefore, bhikṣus, you should train <span class="supplied">to be</span>
like the royal lion and not like the sheep. Thus, O bhikṣus, you should
train.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>
After listening to the Buddha’s words, the bhikṣus were pleased and
respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
