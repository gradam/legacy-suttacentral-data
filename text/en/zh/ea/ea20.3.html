<span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was
staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anthāpiṇḍada’s Park. Then the
Exalted One was expounding the Teachings surrounded by an audience (
<i lang="pi">parṣad</i>) <span class="supplied">consisting of quasi-</span>
innumerable ( <i lang="pi">asaṃkhyeya</i>)
<span class="supplied">persons</span>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
Simultaneously Dharmaruci was alone in his quiet room, reflecting wisely (
<i lang="pi">manasi-</i>√<i lang="pi">kṛ</i>). Fully concentrated he entered
the absorption <span class="supplied">s and then</span> contemplated the
body
<span class="supplied">which he had to put up with in his) previous [life</span>
: In the middle of the Great Ocean it appeared in the shape of a fish that
measured seven hundred <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>. Just as a strong man
instantly bends and <span class="supplied">again</span> stretches his arm,
he immediately left his quiet room, proceeded to the middle of the Great
Ocean and passed by a floating rotten <span class="supplied">fish</span>
carcass.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
On this occasion Dharmaruci uttered the following verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“There are] birth and death for countless aeons and<br>
(The duration of one’s] wandering on in <i lang="pi">saṃsāra</i> is <br>
Incalculable. Everybody is in search of happiness, and<br>
What is obtained is endless misery. Having seen again<br>
One’s former] body, how much less ( <i lang="pi">kiṃ punar</i> ) is there
<br>
The need to create a <span class="supplied">new</span> frame (
<i lang="pi">gṛha</i>)!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
“Once all attachment (<i lang="pi">saṃdhi</i>) has ceased, no further <br>
Physical frame will be found ( <i lang="pi">upa‑</i>√ <i lang="pi">labh</i>
). <span class="supplied">Once</span> the heart <br>
Is not involved at all in any action <span class="supplied">pertaining to
<br>
Saṃsāra</span> , no more clinging (<i lang="pi">abhiṣvaṅga</i>) will be
left <br>
Behind ‑ to say nothing of this kind of frame;
<span class="supplied">for</span> <br>
In Nirvāṇa there is surpassing ( <i lang="pi">adhika</i>) happiness.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
Scarcely had Venerable Dharmaruci uttered these verses when he disappeared
<span class="supplied">at the site of encountering the carcass</span>,
shifted to Śrāvastī, to the Jetavanavihāra, and went to where the Exalted
One was. On seeing Dharmaruci coming near, the Exalted One said: “Excellent
( <i lang="pi">sādhu</i>)—Dharmaruci! Here after a long time.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>
“Indeed, Exalted One,” replied Dharmaruci, “here after a long time.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>
Now the venerable elders and all the <span class="supplied">other</span>
bhikṣus thought to themselves: “This Dharmaruci
<span class="supplied">must</span> have permanently been staying near the
Exalted One because just now the Exalted One has said, ‘Excellent ‑
Dharmaruci! Here for a long time’.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>
Since the Exalted One knew what the bhikṣus were thinking to themselves and
wishing to dispel <span class="supplied">any possible</span> uncertainty (
<i lang="pi">vicikitsā</i>) <span class="supplied">on their part</span>, he
said to them: “It is not because of Dharmaruci that I have made the remark
‘here after a long time
<span class="supplied">and not “for a long time”</span>’.
<span class="supplied">I have made it</span> for the following reasons:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>
“In the past, countless aeons ago, the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara had appeared in
the world, the Fully and Completely Enlightened One, the Blessed One,
perfect in insight-knowledge and good conduct, world-knowing, the supreme
Dharma-charioteer, teacher of gods and men, the Buddha, the Bhagavat.
<span class="supplied">He</span> was just on his way ( <i lang="pi">ā-</i>√
<i lang="pi">pad</i>) to the great kingdom
<span class="supplied">known as</span> Padma, accompanied by a huge number
of bhikṣus, viz. altogether 148,000 persons.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>
“In those days the four assemblies ( <i lang="pi">parṣad</i>) were so
numerous that they could neither be counted nor estimated. The country’s
king, his ministers, civil servants, people from all social strata
<span class="supplied"><i lang="pi">jāti</i></span> came forward
<span class="supplied">with their contributions towards a</span> sacrifice (
<i lang="pi">yajña</i>) in favour of those who are indispensable.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>
“At that time there was a brahmin by the name of Yajñada who lived in the
foothills (<i lang="pi">antika</i>) of the Himālayas. As far as secret
signs, astronomy, and geography were concerned, there was nothing he was not
an expert in. He was also a past master at explaining scriptures and at
scripts. Another speciality of his was the intonation of a sentence
<span class="supplied">consisting of</span> five hundred words and also
<span class="supplied">the science of describing</span> the marks of a great
being (<i lang="pi">mahāpuruṣalakṣaṇa</i>). He taught five hundred disciples
untiringly, day and night, the scriptures
<span class="supplied">dealing with</span> Agni, Sūrya, Soma and the
<span class="supplied">deities pertaining to other</span> heavenly bodies.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>
“The brahmin Yajñada had a disciple whose name was Meghadundubhi whose
features betrayed a very respectable descent and the colour of whose hair
was light reddish-black. The brahmin Meghadundubhi was sagacious and
far-seeing and
<span class="supplied">, once he had embarked upon something,</span> there
was nothing he would not bring to a successful end. Whenever he saw Yajñada,
he at once showed him his devotion (<i lang="pi">bhakti</i>) and of all the
sacrificial formulae (<i lang="pi">mantra</i>) which a brahmin applied in
those days he had perfect command.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a>
“Then the brahmin Meghadundubhi thought to himself: ‘Now all that is
required studying I have fully mastered.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a>
“And again it occurred to him: ‘He who
<span class="supplied">se knowledge</span> surpasses all that is included in
the lists of texts dealing with the sciences (<i lang="pi">śiksā</i>)
<span class="supplied">relevant to</span> a brahmin’s occupation, is
<span class="supplied">my</span> teacher <span class="supplied">whose</span>
kindness should be requited. As for myself, all that I had to study I have
at present gained mastery of. Now I should requite my teacher’s kindness.
However, being poor and without any means enabling
<span class="supplied">me</span> to make offerings to my teacher,
<span class="supplied">I</span> should go off in all directions in search of
the necessary means.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a>
“After this <span class="supplied">musing</span> the brahmin Meghadundubhi
went to the whereabouts of has teacher and said to him: ‘As for the
teachings (<i lang="pi">śāsana</i>) pertaining to the sciences and expertise
of a brahmin, <span class="supplied">I</span> have mastered them now. As a
matter of fact, he who <span class="supplied">se knowledge</span> surpasses
all that is included in the lists of texts dealing with the
<span class="supplied">brahminical</span> sciences and expertise, is
<span class="supplied">my</span> teacher <span class="supplied">whose</span>
kindness should be requited. However, being indigent and lacking gold,
silver and <span class="supplied">other</span> precious things enabling
<span class="supplied">me</span> to make offerings, now
<span class="supplied">I</span> would like to go off in all directions to
ask for assets (<i lang="pi">bhoga</i>) enabling
<span class="supplied">me</span> to make offerings to my teacher.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a>
“On <span class="supplied">hearing these words</span> the brahmin Yajñada
thought: ‘This brahmin Meghadundubhi who is dear to me is always on my mind.
Thinking that <span class="supplied">one day</span> I shall die, I cannot
<span class="supplied">bear the very idea of our</span> being separated for
ever, let alone <span class="supplied">the idea of his</span> intention to
abandon me today and go away. Now how should I proceed in order to keep
<span class="supplied">him</span> and make (him) stay?’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a>
“Then the brahmin Yajñada said to Meghadundubhi: ‘O noble brahmin, for one
reason you do not yet know what a brahmin should have studied.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a>
“In front of his teacher Meghadundubhi asserted: ‘The only thing I am
intent on is the acquisition of knowledge ( <i lang="pi">āgama</i>). What is
it that I have not yet studied?’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a>
“Instantly Yajñada called to mind a recitation
<span class="supplied">consisting of</span> five hundred words (
<i lang="pi">pañcaśatavākpāṭha</i>) and told Meghadundubhi: ‘Now there
exists a text entitled Pañcaśatavākpāṭha. You may receive it.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a>
“‘I hope,’ Meghadundubhi replied, the teacher will be
<span class="supplied">so kind</span> as to instruct me;
<span class="supplied">I</span> would like to obtain the recitation.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="22"></a>
“O bhikṣus,”
<span class="supplied">the Exalted One interrupted his narrative,</span>
“you should know that after
<span class="supplied">Meghadundubhi’s request</span> Yajñada taught this
disciple <span class="supplied">of his</span> the Pañcaśatavākpāṭha. Within
just a few days <span class="supplied">the latter</span> became proficient
at <span class="supplied">reciting the text until then unknown to him</span>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="23"></a>
“Thereafter the brahmin Yajñada said to his five hundred disciples: ‘This
brahmin Meghadundubhi is not really competent
<span class="supplied">as far as</span> teaching methods and comprehensive
knowledge <span class="supplied">are concerned</span>. This being the case,
there is <span class="supplied">someone, however, who</span> has made a name
for himself; his name is “He who Surpasses in Prudence”, Nayātikrama. This
brahmin Nayātikrama posses a most remarkable talent for astronomy and
geography, and there is nothing he is not an expert in. He is a past master
at explaining scriptures and at scripts.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="24"></a>
“When several days had elapsed, the brahmin Nayātikrama went to see his
teacher and said: ‘Now <span class="supplied">I</span> am proficient in the
methods of teaching the brahminical sciences. He who
<span class="supplied">se knowledge</span> surpasses all that is included in
the lists of texts treating the <span class="supplied">brahminical</span>
sciences, is <span class="supplied">my</span> teacher
<span class="supplied">whose</span> kindness, therefore, should be requited.
<span class="supplied">But I have</span> to add that
<span class="supplied">I</span> am poor, lacking gold, silver and
<span class="supplied">other</span> precious things enabling
<span class="supplied">me</span> to make offerings to my teacher. Now I
would like to go off in all directions in search of assets so as to attain
my goal. If only <span class="supplied">I could</span> get permission
<span class="supplied">to do so</span>.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="25"></a>
“‘As you think fit ( <i lang="pi">yasya kālaṃ manyasi</i>),’ replied the
brahmin Yajñada. The brahmin Nayātikrama bowed down
<span class="supplied">his head</span> at his teacher’s feet, stepped
backwards and
<a class="t" id="tT2_598a"></a>
left.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="26"></a>
“In those days not far from the <span class="supplied">main</span> town of
the great kingdom <span class="supplied">known as</span> Padma a huge number
of brahmins had gathered together in one place, viz. 84,000 brahmins, in
order to participate in a great sacrifice (<i lang="pi">yajña</i>) and to
discuss doctrinal matters. The chief
<span class="supplied">of all those brahmins assembled</span> was supposed
to be well-versed in the outsiders” (<i lang="pi">tīrthika</i>) chanting and
explaining scriptures, knowledgeable about astronomy and geography and a
past master at <span class="supplied">explaining</span> extraordinary
<span class="supplied">phenomena such as</span> changes in the
constellations.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="27"></a>
“Everybody was eagerly occupied with amassing five hundred ounces of gold,
one golden staff (<i lang="pi">daṇḍa</i>), one golden jug for ablutions and
one thousand head of cattle <span class="supplied">to be</span> presented to
the foremost teacher <span class="supplied">to be</span> ranked as the most
<span class="supplied">learned among all the brahmins</span>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="28"></a>
“Near the border,] not far from the great kingdom
<span class="supplied">known as</span> Padma the brahmin Nayātikrama heard
that all the brahmins, viz. 84,000 <span class="supplied">persons</span>,
had gathered together at one place, that their proficiency was being tested
<span class="supplied">to find out who would</span> rank foremost so as to
be given the five hundred ounces of gold … and the large
<span class="supplied">herd of</span> one thousand head of cattle.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="29"></a>
“Then it occurred to the brahmin Nayātikrama: ‘Now why do I beg from house
to house? <span class="supplied">I</span> had better go to that enormous
gathering to participate in the proficiency contest.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="30"></a>
“So the brahmin Nayātikrama went to the venue of that giant assembly. When
the large multitude of brahmins saw the brahmin Nayātikrama coming from
afar, they all shouted at the top of their voices: ‘Excellent! The
<span class="supplied">real</span> chief ( <i lang="pi">svāmin</i>) of the
sacrifice <span class="supplied">gathering</span>. Now
<span class="supplied">this function</span> proves immensely useful—so much
so that Brahma is descending in person.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="31"></a>
“All the 84,000 brahmins rose and went to receive
<span class="supplied">him</span>. With one accord
<span class="supplied">they</span> cheered: ‘Welcome (
<i lang="pi">svāgatam</i>), Great Brahmā!’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="32"></a>
“Being <span class="supplied">accorded such tribute,</span> the brahmin
Nayātikrama thought: ‘These brahmins take me to be Brahmā; but I am not
Brahmā.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="33"></a>
“So the brahmin Nayātikrama addressed the brahmins with the
<span class="supplied">following</span> words: ‘Please stop, noble ones! Do
not call me Brahmā! Have you not heard of Yajñada, teacher of so many
brahmins <span class="supplied">living</span> in the north, in the
Himālayas, <span class="supplied">whose</span> mastery of astrology and
geography <span class="supplied">is such that</span> there is nothing
<span class="supplied">he</span> does not <span class="supplied">know</span>
?’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="34"></a>
“The brahmins replied: ‘We have only heard of him, but we have never seen
<span class="supplied">him</span>.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="35"></a>
“‘I am,’ the brahmin Nayātikrama introduced himself, his disciple
Nayātikrama by name.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="36"></a>
“Then the brahmin Nayātikrama turned towards the chief of that mammoth
assembly and said: ‘How about an expert’s showing me his expertise?’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="37"></a>
“Now the chief of that gathering impeccably recited to the brahmin
Nayātikrama the <span class="supplied">texts of</span> the Three Collections.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="38"></a>
“After that the brahmin Nayātikrama again asked the chief: ‘Are
<span class="supplied">you</span> able to recite the Sentence
<span class="supplied">Consisting of</span> Five Hundred Words?’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="39"></a>
“‘I do not know what <span class="supplied">you</span> mean,’ replied the
chief. ‘What is the Sentence <span class="supplied">Consisting of</span>
Five Hundred Words like?’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="40"></a>
“‘O noble ones,’ requested the brahmin Nayātikrama, ‘please listen
attentively; <span class="supplied">I</span> will recite the Sentence
<span class="supplied">Consisting of</span> Five Hundred Words
<span class="supplied">describing</span> the marks of a great being.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="41"></a>
“O bhikṣus <span class="supplied">,” said the Exalted One</span>, “you
should know that on that occasion the brahmin Nayātikrama
<span class="supplied">showed his</span> proficiency in reciting the
<span class="supplied">texts of</span> the Three Collections and the
Sentence <span class="supplied">Consisting of</span> Five Hundred Words
<span class="supplied">describing</span> the marks of a great being. The
84,000 brahmins, overjoyed as never before, were all
<span class="supplied">agreed</span> that this was the first time for them
to listen to the Sentence <span class="supplied">Consisting of</span> Five
Hundred Words <span class="supplied">describing</span> the marks of a great
being and that as from that moment ‘the Venerable’ (<i lang="pi">bhadanta</i>
) <span class="supplied">Nayātikrama</span> should be ranked foremost and
be <span class="supplied">their</span> chief.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="42"></a>
“When the Brahmin Nayātikrama had risen from his seat and again had sat
down on the seat reserved for the chief
<span class="supplied">of the assembly</span>, he very much disliked his
having been ranked foremost in that gathering. He thought to himself with
regard to the vows <span class="supplied">formerly</span> taken by him.
‘These people have made me move to another set so as to fill the vacancy.
Now that I have made known scriptural authority, it will be difficult
<span class="supplied">for me</span> to keep up my practice (
<i lang="pi">śīla</i>). Supposing there is a really virtuous person who
whole-heartedly keeps his vows; he performs actions in conformity with
places he hopes to be born in. I <span class="supplied">would</span> in fact
destroy for good the virtue (<i lang="pi">guṇa</i>)
<span class="supplied">resulting from my brahminical studies and practice should I become attached to name and fame</span>
.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="43"></a>
“Then the person in charge of the munificence
<span class="supplied">function</span> (<i lang="pi">dānasvāmin</i>)
provided five hundred ounces of gold, one golden staff, one golden jug for
ablutions, one thousand head of cattle and one beautiful girl.
<span class="supplied">He</span> handed over
<span class="supplied">these various <i lang="pi">yajña</i> ingredients
</span> to the <span class="supplied">new</span> chairman by facilitating
him with a sacred formula (<i lang="pi">mantra</i>). ‘Herewith,’ said the
chairman to the person in charge of the munificence
<span class="supplied">function</span>, ‘I accept the five hundred ounces of
gold, the golden staff and jug for ablutions in order to offer them to my
master for his support. As to the girl and the one thousand head of cattle,
<span class="supplied">they may</span> be returned to your people because I
do not need them, and I do not have the habit of amassing property.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="44"></a>
“After receiving
<span class="supplied">the five hundred ounces of gold</span>, the golden
staff and jug, the brahmin Nayātikrama entered the great kingdom
<span class="supplied">known as</span> Padma. The name of its king was Dīpa.
As the ruler of that country he had invited the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara and a
<span class="supplied">large</span> multitude (<i lang="pi">gaṇa</i>) of his
bhikṣus to an offering or robes and <span class="supplied">alms</span>-food.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="45"></a>
“In the <span class="supplied">main</span> city of that kingdom the king
issued the order that no fragrant flowers should be sold by any of its
inhabitants. Anyone selling them would incur severe punishment. Even if he
himself took the liberty of buying <span class="supplied">flowers</span> it
should not be compulsory to bypass <span class="supplied">the order</span>
and sell them.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="46"></a>
“Again he had the people clean up <span class="supplied">all places</span>,
sweep and sprinkle them <span class="supplied">with water</span>. Fouled
earth and sand had to be removed. Silken banners and canopies were
fluttering <span class="supplied">in the wind</span>, perfumed water was
showered on the ground; <span class="supplied">all these</span> preparations
created <span class="supplied">an atmosphere of tidiness and serenity</span>
to which sensual pleasures do not bear comparison.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="47"></a>
“Witnessing <span class="supplied">these ongoing preparations</span>, the
brahmin <span class="supplied">Nayātikrama</span> asked
<span class="supplied">some</span> passers-by: ‘
<span class="supplied">All places</span> are being swept and sprinkled
<span class="supplied">with water</span>, roads are being cleared of refuse,
silken banners and canopies are fluttering
<span class="supplied">in the wind</span>;
<span class="supplied">this atmosphere of tidiness and serenity</span> is
incomparable! What special event is it? It is
<span class="supplied">certainly</span> not the crown prince, the heir to
the throne, who is going to marry his graceful bride.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="48"></a>
“‘Does the brahmin not know it?’ the passers-by were wondering and
<span class="supplied">went on</span> to say: ‘For today the king of the
great Padma kingdom has invited the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara, the Fully and
Completely Enlightened One, to an offering of robes and
<span class="supplied">alms</span>-food. For this very reason the roads are
being cleared, silken banners and canopies are fluttering
<span class="supplied">in the wind</span>.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="49"></a>
“On hearing this <span class="supplied">news</span> the brahmin uttered
these words, pregnant with meaning, which he had memorised: ‘It is extremely
rare for a Tathāgata to appear in the world, and since he appears only
occasionally ( <i lang="pi">kadā cit karhi cit</i>)
<span class="supplied">after immense intervals of time</span>, it is
practically impossible to see him. It is exceedingly rare for a Tathāgata to
appear in the world—as rare as the <i lang="pi">udumbara</i> flower
blossoming only occasionally
<span class="supplied">after immense intervals of time</span>. Moreover, in
the brahminical scriptures there is the following saying: It is extremely
rare for two persons to appear in the world. For which two persons? It is
extremely rare for a Tathāgata and for a noble universal monarch to appear
in the world.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="50"></a>
“Then the following occurred to him: ‘Now I could requite the Buddha’s
favour (<i lang="pi">upakāra</i>) at once by respectfully offering Him, the
Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara, the five hundred ounces of gold.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="51"></a>
“And again it came into his mind: ‘According to what the scriptures say, a
Tathāgata neither accepts gold and silver nor other precious things. I could
instead use the five hundred ounces of gold to buy fragrant flowers in order
to shower the Tathāgata with them. Thereafter the Brahmin entered the city
with a view to buying fragrant flowers.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="52"></a>
“‘Does the brahmin not know it?’ also the passers-by in the city were
wondering and <span class="supplied">went on</span> to say: ‘Our king has
issued the order that anyone selling fragrant flowers should be punished
severely.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="53"></a>
“The brahmin Nayātikrama, was at a loss and thought: ‘
<span class="supplied">I</span> just do not know how to get flowers.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="54"></a>
“Having decided to return and having left the city, he stayed outside the
gates <span class="supplied">of the city</span>. There was a Brahmin girl
named Susvādā, carrying a water jug so as to fetch water. In one hand she
was holding five flowers.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="55"></a>
“On seeing that girl the Brahmin said to her: ‘Distinguished (
<i lang="pi">mahat</i>) younger sister, I need the flowers and hope the
younger sister will be kind enough to sell them to me.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="56"></a>
“‘Since when,’ replied the brahmin girl, ‘am I your younger sister? You do
not <span class="supplied">even</span> know who are my parents.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="57"></a>
“‘That girl is really good hearted,’ the brahmin Nayātikrama thought to
himself, she just wants to make fun <span class="supplied">of me</span>.’
Again he said <span class="supplied">to her</span>: ‘Good (
<i lang="pi">bhadra</i>) girl, will you kindly
<span class="supplied">sell me</span> these flowers at any price.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="58"></a>
“‘Do you not know,’ replied the brahmin girl, ‘that His Majesty has
prohibited the sale of flowers?’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="59"></a>
“‘Good girl,’ said the brahmin, ‘as for that matter, do not be concerned.
What has the king to do with you? I urgently need these five flowers, and
you will have got a good bargain.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="60"></a>
“‘What are you going to do with the flowers so urgently needed by you?’
asked the brahmin girl.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="61"></a>
“The brahmin: ‘I <span class="supplied">can</span> see there is fertile
ground that needs to be cultivated <span class="supplied">by means of</span>
these flowers <span class="supplied">for growing roots of merit</span>.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="62"></a>
“The brahmin girl: ‘These flowers have been cut off from their roots; so
they can by no means strike <span class="supplied">root</span> again. How
can you say you want to grow them?’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="63"></a>
“The brahmin: ‘Today, for instance, I see a fertile field to be cultivated;
though bleak and bare <span class="supplied">things</span> grow in it again
and again. All the more
<span class="supplied">fertile is the field in which roots of merit can be cultivated by dint of</span>
these flowers.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="64"></a>
“The brahmin girl: ‘What is this fertile field like in which, though bleak
and bare, <span class="supplied">after</span> cultivation
<span class="supplied">things</span> grow?’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="65"></a>
“The brahmin: ‘Good girl, the Buddha, the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara, the Fully
and Completely Enlightened One, has appeared in the world.’</p>
<p>“The girl: ‘What is the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara like?’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="66"></a>
“The Brahmin: ‘The Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara whose merit is perfect, is endowed
with such <span class="supplied">-and-such</span> (<i lang="pi">īdṛśa</i>)
virtues and such <span class="supplied">-and-such</span> (T2,599a) conduct.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="67"></a>
“The girl: ‘What kind of merit does a virtuous person strive for?’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="68"></a>
“The brahmin: ‘I am filled with the aspiration to become—like the Tathāgata
Dīpaṃkara—fully and completely enlightend in a future existence, being
<span class="supplied">endowed with</span> virtues and conduct like him.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="69"></a>
“The girl: ‘If you promise to accept me as your wife existence after
existence I shall give you the flowers.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="70"></a>
“The brahmin: ‘As for my behaviour ( <i lang="pi">samudācāra</i>), now my
mind is free from clinging.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="71"></a>
“The girl: ‘Let me be your wife in future existences just as now I do not
desire to be your wife physically.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="72"></a>
“The brahmin Nayātikrama: ‘A bodhisattva’s manner of conduct excludes one’s
sparing oneself. If you want to be my wife <span class="supplied">you</span>
should overcome selfish attachment ( <i lang="pi">mamakāra</i>).’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="73"></a>
“The girl: ‘I will by no means betray your aspiring after generosity (
<i lang="pi">dānādhyāśaya</i>). Let me with the right motivation make use of
my body, donating it to others. <span class="supplied">Thus</span> I will
certainly not betray <span class="supplied">our</span> aspiring after
generosity.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="74"></a>
“Then <span class="supplied">the brahmin Nayātikrama</span> took the five
hundred gold coins and bought with them the five flowers. After both
<span class="supplied">he himself</span> and that girl had vowed
<span class="supplied">to embark on a bodhisattva’s practice</span> they
parted company.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="75"></a>
“Meanwhile, the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara, the Fully and Completely Enlightened
One, had put on his <span class="supplied">outer</span> robes and taken up
his alms bowl. Heading the bhikṣus accompanying him in order of seniority,
he entered the great Padma kingdom.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="76"></a>
“Seeing him some distance away, an <span class="supplied">inspiring</span>
appearance of genuine modesty, the brahmin Nayātikrama was not disappointed.
The Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara’s bearing was calm and dignified. He was possessed
of the thirty-two <span class="supplied">primary</span> and the eighty
secondary marks of an extraordinary being (
<i lang="pi">dvātriṃśan mahāpuruṣalakṣaṇāni, aśīty anuvyañjanāni</i>).
<span class="supplied">On seeing him one was</span> reminded of pellucid
water free of all turbidity, allowing the light to penetrate it without
hindrance. Again, <span class="supplied">he</span> resembled a jewel
mountain (<i lang="pi">ratnaparvata</i>) surpassing all
<span class="supplied">other</span> mountains.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="77"></a>
“Having this experience, the brahmin Nayātikrama became elated (
<i lang="pi">sumanas</i>). Holding the five flowers meant for the Tathāgata,
he went to where Dīpaṃkara was and stood at one side; then he said to the
Buddha Dīpaṃkara: ‘It is to be hoped that something will be obtained.
Supposing now the Exalted One decides not to impart anything, then it would
be preferable to put an end to one’s life on the spot. It would not be
worthwhile living on.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="78"></a>
“‘Brahmin,’ said the Exalted One, ‘it is not possible thanks to these five
flowers to impart the Complete and Highest Enlightenment.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="79"></a>
“‘I <span class="supplied">only</span> hope,’ replied the brahmin, ‘the
Exalted One will be so kind as to teach me how to embark on a bodhisattva’s
practice.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="80"></a>
“‘A bodhisattva’s practice,’ explained the Buddha Dīpaṃkara, ‘excludes
one’s sparing oneself.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="81"></a>
“On this occasion the Brahmin uttered the following verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="82"></a>
<span class="dquo">‘</span>No <span class="supplied">body</span> dares take
hold of his parents and give them <br>
Away to other people. The Buddhas, too surpassing<br>
Other wise ( <i lang="pi">vyakta</i> ) persons, dare not give away <br>
Their parents. Sun (!) and moon circling the earth –<br>
These two cannot be given away either. Everything else<br>
Can be given away; it will not be difficult<br>
To make up one’s mind <span class="supplied">to do so</span> .’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="83"></a>
“Then also the Buddha Dīpaṃkara addressed the brahmin with these verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="84"></a>
<span class="dquo">‘</span>The way you talk about giving away is not the
Tathāgata’s <br>
Way to talk about. <span class="supplied">A bodhisattva</span> should be
<span class="supplied">prepared to</span> <br>
Put up with a hundred million aeons of great<br>
Hardship <span class="supplied">involving the giving away of one’s</span>
<br>
Head, trunk, ears, eyes, one’s wife, children, one’s<br>
Realm, treasures, carriages, horses, servants and<br>
Retinue. If <span class="supplied">you</span> can bear all this, then you
<br>
May make <span class="supplied">your</span> resolution.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="85"></a>
“Furthermore, the young brahmin ( <i lang="pi">māṇava</i>) uttered these
verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="86"></a>
<span class="dquo">‘</span>The high mountain of great hardship burning like
<br>
Fire—for a hundred million aeons <span class="supplied">I</span> will put
up <br>
With carrying it on <span class="supplied">my</span> head.
<span class="supplied">My</span> aspiring for <br>
Supreme enlightenment ( <i lang="pi">bodhicitta</i>) shall not be <br>
Impaired. All <span class="supplied">I</span> wish now is to make my
resolution.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="87"></a>
“Now the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara kept silent, and the Brahmin, holding in his
hand the five flowers, knelt down with his right knee on the ground and
scattered <span class="supplied">the flowers</span> over the Tathāgata. In
doing this, he said: ‘May this action be conducive to having merit also in a
future existence. Not unlike the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara, I shall realise Full
and Complete Enlightenment.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="88"></a>
“On the spot he let down <span class="supplied">his long</span> hair,
spread it on a muddy
<span class="supplied">section of the road and said</span>: ‘If the
Tathāgata approves of my resolution <span class="supplied">He</span> may
kindly cross the muddy section by stepping on my hair.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="89"></a>
“O bhikṣus,” <span class="supplied">said the Exalted One</span>, “you
should know that the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara looked into the brahmin’s mind and
scrutinised what he was thinking. Then he said to the brahmin: ‘In a future
existence you will realise Full and Complete Enlightenment and become the
Tathāgata Śākyamuni Buddha.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="90"></a>
“At that time a fellow student of the brahmin Nayātikrama, Dharmaruci by
name, stood next to the Tathāgata. Witnessing the Buddha Dīpaṃkara’s
approval of the Brahmin Nayātikrama’s resolution by stepping on
<span class="supplied">the latter’s</span> hair, he remonstrated: ‘How can
this shaveling of a śramaṇa be so impudent as to trample on this pure
brahmin’s hair? This is not a <span class="supplied">civilised</span> man’s
behaviour!’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="91"></a>
“As for the brahmin Yajñada of those days,” asked the Buddha the bhikṣus,
“do you <span class="supplied">think</span> he was an altogether unique
person? Do not regard him as such because the person of that time
<span class="supplied">known as</span> Yajñada is none other than
Śuddhodana. As for the former chief of the
<span class="supplied">assembly of</span> 84,000. brahmins, he is none other
than Devadatta, and I was at that time that very Brahmin Nayātikrama. As far
as the Brahmin girl of those days is concerned who sold the flowers, she is
now Gopī, and the person in charge of the <i lang="pi">yajña</i>
<span class="supplied">function</span> is none other than the Brahmin
Daṇḍapāṇi.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="92"></a>
“Dharmaruci who hurled abusive language at the Tathāgata in those days is
in fact the Dharmaruci of today. For innumerable aeons this Dharmaruci was
again and again born as a domestic animal, and in his
<span class="supplied">second but</span> last life he took on the body of a
fish that measured seven hundred <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>, living in the
Great Ocean. That existence having come to an end, he was born here
<span class="supplied">again as a human being</span>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="93"></a>
“By always being close to a spiritual friend ( <i lang="pi">kalyāṇamitra</i>
), by relying on a spiritual friend one habituates oneself to karmically
wholesome actions conducing to the <span class="supplied">spiritual</span>
faculties, to the gates ( <i lang="pi">dvāra</i>) of deliverance and to
supernormal knowledge ( <i lang="pi">abhijñā</i>).</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="94"></a>
“It is for this very reason that I have said: ‘Here after a long time.’ And
Dharmaruci, too, expressed himself: ‘Indeed, Exalted One, here after a long
time.’ Thus, O bhikṣus, you should constantly cultivate
<span class="supplied">mindfulness</span> with regard to physical, vocal and
mental actions. Thus, O bhikṣus, you should train.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="95"></a>
After listening to the Buddha’s words, the bhikṣus were pleased and
respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
