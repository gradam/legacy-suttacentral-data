</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying in Rājagṛha, at Karaņḍa’s Bamboo Grove, together with a great number of bhikṣus, five hundred persons in all. In order of seniority, by turns <span class="supplied">they</span> were expounding the Teaching.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At the same time, Devadatta was heading five hundred bhikṣus, passing by in the proximity of the Tathāgata. On seeing Devadatta at some distance heading his apprentices, the Exalted One uttered these verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“One should not keep close company with a bad friend;<br>
One should not be so stupid ( <i lang="pi">bāla</i>) as to deal with <span class="supplied">such<br>
A person</span> . One should keep company with a spiritual<br>
Friend who is pre-eminent ( <i lang="pi">viśiṣṭa</i>) among men who are<br>
Without blemish to the core.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Cultivating the friendship of<br>
A bad friend will necessarily <span class="supplied">bring about</span> the roots (<i lang="pi">mūla</i>)<br>
Of <span class="supplied">all</span> sorts of what is karmically unwholesome (<i lang="pi">akuśala</i>),<br><span class="supplied">Plunging one</span> into darkness (<i lang="pi">tamas</i>) for an eternity.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>When Devadatta’s five hundred disciples had heard the Exalted One utter these verses, they went to where the Exalted One was, bowed down … and sat down at one side. They <span class="supplied">felt</span> under compulsion to get up <span class="supplied">again</span> and confess to the Exalted One their offences (<i lang="pi">aparādha</i>): “We have been confused and foolish enough not to <span class="supplied">rely on a spiritual</span> friend. If only the Exalted One would acknowledge our remorse (<i lang="pi">kaukṛtya</i>) and forgive us (<i lang="pi">kṣam</i>).”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>Then the Exalted One accepted the confession of those five hundred bhikṣus and forgave them. Furthermore, <span class="supplied">he</span> expounded <span class="supplied">to them</span> the Teaching so that they regained their fundamental trust (<i lang="pi">śraddhāmūla</i>).</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>Afterwards the five hundred bhikṣus stayed at a secluded, quiet place, wisely reflecting (<i lang="pi">manasi-</i>√<i lang="pi">kṛ</i>) on the profundities of the Teaching. Consequently, the five hundred bhikṣus attained <span class="supplied">what is striven after by</span> sons of good family who go forth into homelessness in order to follow the way <span class="supplied">leading to Nirvāṇa</span> and who led the unsurpassed holy life out of faith and resolution, namely arhatship. Now they knew in accordance with fact:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“Birth and death have come to an end, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, and there will be no more entering a womb (<i lang="pi">garbha</i>).”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>After the five hundred persons” realisation of arhatship and after listening to the Buddha’s words, the bhikṣus were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.”</p>
