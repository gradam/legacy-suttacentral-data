<h1><span class="supplied">Three Practices</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then the Exalted One said to the monks:</p>
<p>“If a monk is possessed of three qualities he will well experience happiness in this life and realise, through great perseverance and energy, the end of existential constituents under the sway of malign influences. Which are the three? There is a monk who a) is composed with respect to the sense faculties, b) moderate in eating and c) who does not neglect his walking-exercises.</p>
<p>“How is a monk composed with respect to the sense faculties? In this regard, when seeing a form with the eye, he neither starts indulging in notions <span class="supplied">concerning that form</span> nor does he recall <span class="supplied">any notions</span>. <span class="supplied">Thus, by seeing with perfect mindfulness,</span> he realises purification regarding the faculty of the eye. By means <span class="supplied">of this achievement</span> he aspires to <span class="supplied">ultimate</span> freedom, always guarding the faculty of the eye. When hearing a sound with the ear, smelling a scent with the nose, recognising a flavour with the tongue, feeling tangibles with the body or being aware of mental objects with his mind, he neither starts indulging in notions nor does he recall <span class="supplied">any notions</span>. <span class="supplied">Thus, by … being aware with perfect mindfulness,</span> he realises purification regarding the faculty of … the mind, and by means <span class="supplied">of this achievement</span> he aspires to <span class="supplied">ultimate</span> freedom, always guarding each sense faculty. Thus a monk is composed with regard to the sense faculties.</p>
<p>“How is a monk moderate in eating? In this regard <span class="supplied">he takes his food,</span> thinking where it has come from, and not in order to become plump and beautiful. <span class="supplied">He eats</span> only with a view to supporting <a class="t">604a</a> the body and keeping the four physical elements in shape, <span class="supplied">reflecting:</span> Now I should check former pangs <span class="supplied">of hunger</span> and prevent new ones from arising, letting the body have <span class="supplied">enough</span> strength to practise the <span class="supplied">Noble</span> Path and lest the holy life be impeded; <span class="supplied">take</span> for example a bad abscess that has developed on a man or woman’s body to which a salve is applied for the <span class="supplied">sole</span> purpose of occasioning a cure. Similarly, O monks, a monk is moderate in eating, thinking where the food <span class="supplied">that he is taking</span> has come from; he does not take it in order to become stout … and <span class="supplied">he eats</span> only with a view to supporting the body … lest the holy life be impeded. <span class="supplied">Take again</span> for example, a cart <span class="supplied">carrying</span> heavy loads. Its wheels are greased for the <span class="supplied">sole</span> purpose of delivering heavy <span class="supplied">loads</span> at their destinations. Similarly, a monk is moderate in eating, thinking … he does not <span class="supplied">take food</span> in order to become stout … Thus a monk is moderate in eating.</p>
<p>“How does a monk not neglect his walking-exercises? In this regard, in the first and last <span class="supplied">watches of</span> the night he diligently and mindfully takes his walking-exercises without being mistaken about the periods <span class="supplied">of day and night.</span> Continually he directs his attention to making use of the aids of enlightenment. During daytime, whether he is walking or sitting, he wisely reflects on the eminent Teaching <span class="supplied">and thus</span> rids himself of hindrances diminishing <span class="supplied">all his efforts</span>. Again, in the first <span class="supplied">watch of</span> the night, whether he is walking or sitting, he wisely reflects … and rids himself … ; in the middle <span class="supplied">watch of</span> the night, lying on his right side, he directs his attention to waking up <span class="supplied">again</span>; in the last <span class="supplied">watch of</span> the night he rises <span class="supplied">and starts</span> walking; he wisely reflects on the profound Teaching, ridding himself of the hindrances diminishing <span class="supplied">his efforts</span>. Thus a monk does not neglect his walking-exercises.</p>
<p>“If a monk is composed with respect to the sense faculties, moderate in eating and if he does not neglect his walking-exercises, always mindful and directing his attention to making use of the aids of enlightenment, he will surely reap two results: in this life he will realise <span class="supplied">the state of</span> a non-returner. Just as a skilled charioteer drives his chariot <span class="supplied">pulled by</span> four horses, keeping to the smooth surface of the middle of the road, and <span class="supplied">thus</span> definitely <span class="supplied">proceeds</span> without delay wherever he wishes to go, even so this monk will definitely <span class="supplied">reap excellent results</span>. If he is composed … making use of the aids of enlightenment, he will surely reap two results: in this life he will be rid of the malign influences and become a non-returner.”</p>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the monks were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
