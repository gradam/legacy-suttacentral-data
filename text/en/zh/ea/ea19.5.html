<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove. Then the Exalted One said to the monks: </p>
<p>“In the world there are these modes of behaviour which do not allow a person to be wise. Which are the two? (1) To have an aversion to consulting experienced and capable persons and (2) to be much given to slothfulness and lethargy. These are, monks, the two modes of behaviour that do not allow a person to be wise.</p>
<p>“There are, however, two modes of behaviour which allow a person to obtain perfect wisdom. Which two? (1) To be eager in asking others to clarify something and (2) to be full of vivacity rather than sloth. It is these two modes of behaviour which allow a person to be wise.</p>
<p>“One should train to overcome <span class="supplied">the above-mentioned</span> modes of karmically unwholesome behaviour. Thus, O monks, one should actually train.”</p>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the monks were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
