<section class="sutta" id="ea17.1"><article><hgroup><h1>Ekottarāgama 17.1</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at the Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then, in time, the Exalted One put on his <span class="supplied">outer</span> robes and took up his alms-bowl. Entering the city of Śrāvastī, he was followed by Rāhula.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Caring for the latter, he turned to the right and looking back, said: “Now, Rāhula, you must contemplate form as being impermanent.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Certainly, Exalted One,” replied Rāhula, “form is impermanent.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“O Rāhula,” the Exalted One went on to say, “feeling, perception, formative forces, and consciousness—they are all absolutely impermanent.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>Again Rāhula responded: “Certainly, Exalted One; feeling … and consciousness—all are impermanent.” Now Venerable (<i lang="pi">bhadanta</i>) Rāhula thought to himself: “For what reason (<i lang="pi">kiṃkāraṇa</i>) am I being cared for while just reaching the city? And why is it that on the way the Exalted One admonishes (<i lang="pi">avavadati</i>) me? Now I ought to return to my place; no need to enter the city and beg for alms-food.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>So, midway on the spot, Venerable Rāhula returned to the Jetavanavihāra, and with robes and alms-bowl, he proceeded to the root of a tree and sat down cross-legged (<i lang="pi">paryaṅka</i>), straightening body and mind. Fully concentrated and with one-pointedness of mind (<i lang="pi">cittaikāgratā</i>), he contemplated form, feeling, perception, formative forces, and consciousness as being impermanent.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>Meanwhile, the Exalted One had finished begging for alms-food at Śrāvastī and, after his repast at the Jetavanavihāra, he took his walking-exercise (<i lang="pi">caṅkramaṇa</i>). In the course of time he came to the place where Rāhula was to be found and addressed him as follows:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“You should practise <span class="supplied">mindfulness of</span> breathing (<i lang="pi">ānāpānasmṛti</i>). If such is your practice (<i lang="pi">dharma</i>) all sorrow (<i lang="pi">śokasaṃjñā</i>) you may experience is bound to be completely left behind. You are still in the grip of worldly ways and muddled thinking. Covetousness (<i lang="pi">lobha</i>) and attachment (<i lang="pi">anunaya</i>) have to be eradicated.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“Now, Rāhula, you should cultivate friendliness (<i lang="pi">maitrī</i>) in your heart. You have already cultivated it, but any dislike (<i lang="pi">dveṣa</i>), any aversion (<i lang="pi">pratigha</i>) still in existence—an end has to be put to all that once and for all. O Rāhula, you must also cultivate a heart <span class="supplied">full of</span> compassion (<i lang="pi">karuṇā</i>). You have surely cultivated it, but even the slightest <span class="supplied">tendencies towards</span> cruelty (<i lang="pi">vihiṃsā</i>) in your heart have to be wiped out. You must further cultivate a heart <span class="supplied">full of</span> sympathetic joy (<i lang="pi">muditā</i>). <span class="supplied">Although</span> you have already done so, you must <span class="supplied">persist in your practice in order to</span> cleanse your heart totally of jealousy (<i lang="pi">īrṣyā).</i> O Rāhula, do cultivate equanimity (<i lang="pi">upekṣā</i>). You have certainly been doing so, <span class="supplied">but continue cultivating it</span> so as to extirpate conceit (<i lang="pi">māna</i>) and arrogance (<i lang="pi">mada</i>).”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>Thereupon the Exalted One addressed these verses to Rāhula:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>“Eschew once and for all attachment to views and<br>
Always follow <span class="supplied">instead</span> the Teaching wholeheartedly.<br>
He who is endowed <span class="supplied">due to Dharma practice</span> with <span class="supplied">insight<br>
Knowledge will therefore be held in esteem everywhere.</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>“Holding [aloft for mankind the torch of wisdom (<i lang="pi">vidyā),</i><br>
One will dispel the darkness <span class="supplied">of delusion</span> and <span class="supplied">thus<br>
Be deeply respected by gods and <i lang="pi">nāgas.</i><br>
[This is the</span> proper <span class="supplied">way of</span> venerating one’s Master.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>Thereupon the bhikṣu Rāhula, in reply to the Exalted One, uttered the following verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a>“I will not be attached to views and will<br>
Always follow the Teaching. {T 2, 582a}<br>
Being endowed with <span class="supplied">insight-</span>knowledge <span class="supplied">due to Dharma practice</span>,<br><span class="supplied">I will</span> thus be able <span class="supplied">really</span> to venerate the Master.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a>Having given this instruction, the Exalted One left and went back to his <span class="supplied">own</span> quiet room, whilst Venerable Rāhula was wondering how one would practise <span class="supplied">mindfulness of</span> breathing, abandon <span class="supplied">vain</span> thoughts and overcome all sorrow. Then Rāhula rose from his seat and went to the Exalted One’s whereabouts. On his arrival, he bowed down his head at <span class="supplied">the Exalted One’s</span> feet and sat down at one side. Presently (<i lang="pi">muhūrtena</i>), he rose again and asked the Exalted One:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a>“How does one practise <span class="supplied">mindfulness of</span> breathing, abandon <span class="supplied">vain</span> thoughts and overcome all sorrow? How does one obtain as sublime result (<i lang="pi">mahāphala</i>) the taste of deathlessness (<i lang="pi">amṛtarasa</i>)?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a>The Exalted One replied: “Well said, well said, (<i lang="pi">sādhu</i>), Rāhula! You are indeed capable of asking this question and thereby ‘roaring the lion’s roar’ (<i lang="pi">siṃhanādanādin</i>) in front of the Tathāgata: How does one practise <span class="supplied">mindfulness of</span> breathing … the taste of deathlessness? Now, Rāhula, listen attentively and take heed (<i lang="pi">śṛṇu sādhu ca suṣṭhu ca manasi-kuru</i>). The time has come for me to elucidate and give you details (<i lang="pi">nir-diś</i>).”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a>“Just so, Exalted One,” replied Rāhula. While Venerable Rāhula <span class="supplied">joined his hands as a token of reverence</span> to receive the Exalted One’s Teaching, he was given the following instruction:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a>“A bhikṣu intent on a quiet, secluded and really lonely place <span class="supplied">goes there</span>, sits down cross-legged and straightens body and mind. Concentrating on the tip of his nose without letting mental proliferation (<i lang="pi">nānātva</i>) arise, he breathes out a long <span class="supplied">breath</span> and is fully aware of it; breathing in a long <span class="supplied">breath</span>, he is fully aware of it; breathing out a short <span class="supplied">breath</span>, he is fully aware of it; breathing in a short <span class="supplied">breath</span>, he is fully aware of it; breathing out a cool <span class="supplied">breath</span> … breathing in a cool <span class="supplied">breath</span> …, breathing out a warm <span class="supplied">breath</span> … breathing in a warm <span class="supplied">breath</span>, he is fully aware of it. He contemplates the whole bodily <span class="supplied">process of</span> inhaling and exhaling and is fully aware of everything. When there is breathing he is fully aware of its presence, and when there is no breathing, he is fully aware of its absence. In the event of breathing out conditioned by the mind, he is fully aware of it; and in the event of breathing in conditioned by the mind, he is fully aware of it. In this way, Rāhula, one can practise <span class="supplied">mindfulness of</span> breathing and thereby abandon all thoughts of aversion and confusion (<i lang="pi">vikṣiptasaṃjñā</i>), overcome all sorrow and thus obtain the taste of deathlessness as sublime result.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a>When the Exalted One had imparted this subtle Teaching (<i lang="pi">sūkṣmadharma</i>) in some detail to Rāhula, the latter rose from his seat, paid his respects at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated <span class="supplied">the former</span> thrice and left. Rāhula went to the foot of a tree in the Andhavana, sat down cross-legged and straightened body and mind, concentrating on the tip of his nose without letting any redundant (<i lang="pi">adhika</i>) thoughts arise. Breathing out a long <span class="supplied">breath</span> he was fully aware of it; breathing in a long <span class="supplied">breath</span>, he was fully aware of it; breathing out a short <span class="supplied">breath</span> … a cool <span class="supplied">breath</span> … a warm <span class="supplied">breath</span> …, he was fully aware of it. He contemplated the whole bodily <span class="supplied">process of</span> inhaling and exhaling and was fully aware of everything. When there was breathing … and no breathing, he was also fully aware of its absence. In the event of breathing out … breathing in conditioned by the mind, he was again fully aware of it.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a>Then Rāhula wisely reflected (<i lang="pi">manasi-kṛ</i>) thus: “A mind full of attachment subsequently set free from <span class="supplied">all passions</span> is cleansed (<i lang="pi">nirmukta</i>) of all that is karmically unwholesome (<i lang="pi">akuśala</i>).” He <span class="supplied">entered and</span> remained in the first absorption (<i lang="pi">dhyāna</i>) in which there is thinking, deliberation (<i lang="pi">savitarka, savicāra</i>) and mindfully experiencing joy (<i lang="pi">prīti</i>) and happiness (<i lang="pi">sukha</i>).</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="22"></a>Upon the cessation of thinking and deliberation, he <span class="supplied">realised</span> perfect inner quiet and perfect concentration (<i lang="pi">adhyātmam samprasāda, cetasa ekotībhāva</i>).<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="" id="_ednref11"><sup>11</sup></a> He <span class="supplied">entered and</span> remained in the second absorption in which there is neither thinking nor deliberation, yet mindfully experiencing joy <span class="supplied">born</span> of concentration (<i lang="pi">samādhija</i>).</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="23"></a>Then perfectly mindful, after the cessation of joy (<i lang="pi">niṣprītika</i>), while experiencing just that physical well-being (<i lang="pi">sukhaṃ ca kāyena pratisaṃvedayati</i>) which the Noble Ones experience <i lang="pi">(upa-labh</i>) with equanimity, complete satisfaction (<i lang="pi">paritoṣa</i>) and mindfulness, he <span class="supplied">entered and</span> remained in the third absorption.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="24"></a>When he had gone beyond (<i lang="pi">prahāṇa</i>) pleasure and pain and was rid of sorrow, he <span class="supplied">entered and</span> remained in the forth absorption which is free of both suffering and happiness and utterly pure <span class="supplied">because of</span> equanimity and mindfulness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="25"></a>With the help of this concentration, his mind became utterly pure and was rid of flaws (<i lang="pi">rajas</i>) and blemishes (<i lang="pi">doṣa</i>), while his body was exceedingly supple (<i lang="pi">mṛdu</i>). He recognised places from the past and remembered what he had previously done. He vividly (<i lang="pi">dravyatas</i>) recognised his <span class="supplied">former</span> abodes during incalculable aeons. He also remembered former existences (<i lang="pi">jāti</i>)—one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, several hundred thousand previous lives, a period of evolution and of destruction <span class="supplied">of the world</span> (<i lang="pi">vivarta, saṃvartakalpa</i>), innumerable periods of evolution and destruction, hundreds of millions, incalculable aeons. <span class="supplied">He remembered:</span> I was born and had such and such a name, belonged to such and such a lineage, had such and such food, experienced such and such pains and pleasures, had <span class="supplied">such and such</span> long and short life-spans. There I died, here I was reborn; here I died <span class="supplied">again</span> and was reborn there.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="26"></a>With the help of this concentration, his mind was utterly pure and rid of flaws, blemishes and all fetters (<i lang="pi">saṃyojana</i>). Furthermore, he <span class="supplied">directed his</span> mind to the knowledge of beings” coming into existence. With the purified and immaculate “divine eye” (<i lang="pi">divyacakṣus</i>) he saw <span class="supplied">many</span> kinds of beings—how they are born and how they die. He understood in accordance with fact (<i lang="pi">yathābhūtam</i>) that <span class="supplied">beings</span> are good-looking, ugly, well-destined or ill-destined—depending respectively on their good and bad behaviour (<i lang="pi">carita</i>) and deeds (<i lang="pi">kṛta</i>). <span class="supplied">He understood that</span> on the one hand, there are beings who bodily, vocally and mentally misbehaved, insulted the Noble Ones, held false views, performed actions determined by false views, and who, at the breaking up of the body and after their death, have gone to hell (<i lang="pi">naraka</i>); that, on the other hand, there are beings who bodily, vocally and mentally behaved well, did not insult the Noble Ones, always held right views, performed actions determined by right views and who, at the breaking up of the body and after death, have gone to a good, a heavenly world (<i lang="pi">sugati, divyam</i>). This <span class="supplied">superknowledge (<i lang="pi">abhijnā</i>) of his</span> is called the purified and immaculate “divine eye” <span class="supplied">thanks to which he</span> saw <span class="supplied">many</span> kinds of beings …. <span class="supplied">and thanks to which he</span> understood in accordance with fact that <span class="supplied">beings</span> are good-looking … depending respectively on their good and bad behaviour and deeds.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="27"></a>Moreover, he directed his mind to effect the destruction (<i lang="pi">kṣaya</i>) of the mind’s malign influences (<i lang="pi">āsrava</i>). He realised and knew in accordance with fact: This is unsatisfactoriness (<i lang="pi">duḥkha</i>); he realised and knew in accordance with fact the origin (<i lang="pi">samudaya</i>) of unsatisfactoriness, its final cessation (<i lang="pi">duḥkhanirodha</i>) and what has necessarily to be done (<i lang="pi">avaśyakārya</i>) in order to overcome unsatisfactoriness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="28"></a>By dint of such penetrating insight (<i lang="pi">vipaśyanā</i>), his mind was freed from the malign influences of desire (<i lang="pi">kāmāsrava</i>), of becoming (<i lang="pi">bhava</i>) and of ignorance (<i lang="pi">avidyā</i>). Having realised <span class="supplied">ultimate</span> freedom (<i lang="pi">vimukti</i>), he gained the <span class="supplied">insight-</span>knowledge of this freedom and knew in accordance with fact: Birth and death have come to an end, the holy life (<i lang="pi">brahmacarya</i>) has been lived, what had to be done has been done, and there will be no more coming into existence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="29"></a>At that time Venerable Rāhula became an Arhat and, after his realisation of arhatship, he rose from his seat, adjusted his robes and went to the Exalted One’s whereabouts. <span class="supplied">There</span> he bowed down his head at <span class="supplied">the Exalted One’s</span> feet, stood to one side and said to the Exalted One: “<span class="supplied">My</span> aspirations have come true: the eradication of all malign influences.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="30"></a>Then the Exalted One said to all the bhikṣus <span class="supplied">present</span>: “Among all those who realised arhatship, none is like Rāhula. For what reason? As far as the eradication of malign influences is concerned, there is the bhikṣu Rāhula <span class="supplied">who achieved it</span> and in respect of observing rules and of being given to training (<i lang="pi">śikṣā</i>), there is again Rāhula <span class="supplied">who excels</span>. All previous Tathāgatas and Perfectly Enlightened Ones, too, had this bhikṣu Rāhula <span class="supplied">as their so, and it was the bhikṣu Rāhula who was anxious that he should be called ‘son of the Buddha’ who himself, following the Buddha, reached the ultimate goal (<i lang="pi">dharma</i>). Amongst my disciples,” the Exalted One went on saying to the bhikṣus, “the foremost among those capable of observing the rules of training is the bhikṣu Rāhula.”</span></p>
<p>Then the Exalted One uttered these verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="31"></a>“[If one conscientiously <span class="supplied">observes</span> the rules of moral training<br>
One will perfect all one’s spiritual faculties ( <i lang="pi">indriya</i>).<br>
One has to <span class="supplied">develop them</span> step by step until one reaches [the ultimate goal<br>
Completely ridding oneself of all fetters.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="32"></a>Having listened to the Exalted One’s words, all the bhikṣus were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
