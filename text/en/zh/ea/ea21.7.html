</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then the Exalted One said to the bhikṣus:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“There are three <span class="supplied">kinds of</span> severe affliction. Which are the three?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“There are the severe afflictions <span class="supplied">caused by</span> a) the windy humour of the body (<i lang="pi">vāta</i>), b) the phlegmatic humour (<i lang="pi">śleṣman</i>) and c) cold (<i lang="pi">śīta</i>). These are, O bhikṣus, the three <span class="supplied">kinds of</span> severe affliction.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“But there also are available three <span class="supplied">kinds of</span> effective medicine for the three severe afflictions. Which are the three?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“When somebody is affected with the windy humour of the body, an effective medicine will be a) ghee (<i lang="pi">ghṛta</i>); what one does in this case is to take ghee. When somebody is afflicted with the phlegmatic humour, an effective medicine will be b) honey (<i lang="pi">madhu</i>); what one does in this case is to take honey, and when somebody is afflicted with cold, an effective medicine will be c) sesame oil (<i lang="pi">taila</i>); what one does in this case is to take sesame oil. These are, bhikṣus, the three <span class="supplied">kinds of</span> severe affliction and their respective cure.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Similarly, bhikṣus, there are the following three <span class="supplied">kinds of</span> severe affliction. Which are the three?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“a) Covetousness (<i lang="pi">lobha</i>)/attachment (<i lang="pi">anunaya</i>), b) hatred (<i lang="pi">dveṣa</i>)/aversion (<i lang="pi">pratigha</i>) and c) ignorance (<i lang="pi">avidyā</i>)/delusion (<i lang="pi">moha</i>)—these, bhikṣus are the three <span class="supplied">kinds of</span> severe affliction. But there also are available three <span class="supplied">kinds of</span> effective medicine for the three severe afflictions. Which are the three?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“When there are covetousness and attachment, one <span class="supplied">should</span> have recourse to a) repulsiveness (<i lang="pi">aśubha</i>) as remedy (<i lang="pi">pratikāra</i>) by way of reflecting on what is repulsive.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“<span class="supplied">When</span> one is afflicted with hatred and aversion, one <span class="supplied">should</span> have recourse to b) friendliness (<i lang="pi">maitrī</i>) as remedy by way of cultivating friendliness in one’s heart.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>“<span class="supplied">When</span> one is afflicted with ignorance and delusion, one <span class="supplied">should</span> have recourse to c) wisdom (<i lang="pi">prajñā</i>) as remedy by way of <span class="supplied">insight into</span> dependent origination (<i lang="pi">pratītyasamutpāda</i>).</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>“These are, bhikṣus, the three <span class="supplied">kinds of</span> severe affliction and respective cure. Accordingly, bhikṣus, you should aspire to skill in means to avail yourselves of the three <span class="supplied">kinds of</span> remedy. Thus, bhikṣus, you should train.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the bhikṣus were pleased … to practice.</p>
