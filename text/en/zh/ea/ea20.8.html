</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then the Exalted One said to the bhikṣus:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“If a bhikṣus who lives in the forest at a secluded, quiet place remote from the crowds, he should always reverentially (<i lang="pi">gauravajāta</i>) cultivate a mind that is content (<i lang="pi">tuṣṭa</i>).</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“If, on the other hand, a bhikṣu, living in the forest at a secluded and quiet place, does not reverentially cultivate contentment (<i lang="pi">tuṣṭi</i>), he will mainly occupy himself (<i lang="pi">vi-ni-</i>√<i lang="pi">yuj</i>) in staying with big crowds for the sake of what people talk about <span class="supplied">because</span> he does not know what a forest-dweller’s practice (<i lang="pi">dharma</i>) should be like.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“How then has a bhikṣu, <span class="supplied">although</span> fond of solitude, no reverential attitude and does not cultivate contentment?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“The answer is <span class="supplied">this</span>, O bhikṣus: First the <i lang="pi">āraṇyaka</i> bhikṣu, staying at a secluded, quiet place and avoiding the crowds, continually puts effort into <span class="supplied">what is to be done</span> and does not <span class="supplied">succumb to</span> laziness and arrogance (<i lang="pi">māna</i>). First he is well aware of the necessity of what <span class="supplied">he should</span> practise. If, in the course of his forest dwelling and abiding at a secluded, quiet place, he becomes lazy and arrogant, he will involve himself in all <span class="supplied">sorts of</span> misconduct (<i lang="pi">duścarita</i>), staying with big crowds for the sake of what people talk about. Such an <i lang="pi">āraṇyaka</i> bhikṣu is lazy and lacking in effort.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“For this reason, bhikṣus, a bhikṣu who is fond of solitude, living at a secluded, quiet place and avoiding the crowds, should always be gentle and cultivate contentment. Being rid of laziness and arrogance, reverentially and mindfully putting effort into <span class="supplied">what is to be done</span>, with unwavering determination and wholeheartedly taking upon oneself (<i lang="pi">upa-sam-</i>√<i lang="pi">pad</i>) all that is karmically wholesome—thus, O bhikṣus, you should train.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the bhikṣus were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
