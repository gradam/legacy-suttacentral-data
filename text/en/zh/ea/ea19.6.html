<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then the Exalted One said to the bhikṣus:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“There are two modes of behaviour which render a person poor and destitute. Which are the two modes? (1) When seeing others practising generosity (<i lang="pi">dāna</i>), preventing this and, moreover, (2) being oneself unwilling to be generous. These are, O monks, the two modes of behaviour rendering a person poor and destitute.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Then, monks, there are two modes of behaviour rendering a person estimable. Which two? (1) When seeing a person distributing things to others, gladly supporting him <span class="supplied">or her in this charitable act</span> and (2) oneself taking delight in being generous. These are, bhikṣus, the two modes of behaviour rendering a person estimable.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Thus, O monks, one should train in practicing generosity and in overcoming of acquisitiveness.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the bhikṣus were pleased and respectfully rendered themselves to practice.</p>
