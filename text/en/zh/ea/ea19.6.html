</html><p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s <a class="t">595a</a> Park. Then the Exalted One said to the monks:</p>
<p>“There are two modes of behaviour which render a person poor and destitute. Which are the two modes? (1) When seeing others practising generosity and, moreover, (2) being oneself unwilling to be generous. These are, O monks, the modes of behaviour rendering a person poor and destitute. </p>
<p>“The, monks, there are two modes of behaviour rendering a person estimable. Which two? (1) When seeing a person distributing things to others, gladly supporting him <span class="supplied">or her in this charitable act</span> and (2) oneself taking in delight in being generous. These are, monks, the two modes of behaviour rendering a person estimable.</p>
<p>“Thus, O monks, one should train in practising generosity and overcoming acquisitiveness.”</p>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the monks were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
