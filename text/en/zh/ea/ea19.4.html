<span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was
staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then the
Exalted One said to the bhikṣus:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“In the world there are these two living beings ( <i lang="pi">dehin</i>)
who are not frightened when becoming aware of lightning and thunder. Which
are the two? These two living beings, O monks, who are found in the world
and who do not experience fright from becoming aware of lightning and
thunder are the lion, king of beasts, and the arhat with whom the malign
influences have come to an end ( <i lang="pi">kṣīṇāsrava</i>).</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“Therefore, O monks, one should train to become an arhat with whom the
malign influences have come to an end. Thus, O bhikṣus, one should actually
train.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
After listening to the Buddha’s words the bhikṣus were pleased and
respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
