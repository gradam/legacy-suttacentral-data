<h1><span class="supplied">Three Meritorious Actions</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then the Exalted One said to the monks:</p>
<p>“There are three <span class="supplied">kinds of</span> meritorious actions. Which are the three? The meritorious action consisting (a) in generosity, (b) in equilibrium and (c) in <span class="supplied">wise</span> reflection.</p>
<p>“What does meritorious action consisting in generosity mean? When there is someone, happily making donations to ascetics and brahmins, to the poorest of the poor, to the bereaved and uprooted; who, when food is needed, provides food, and when encouragement is needed, gives encouragement; who <span class="supplied">offers</span> robes, alms-food, lodging, medicine for treating the sick, fragrant substances, flowers and temporary accommodation unstintingly, contenting himself with what he has on the body—this is what is called the meritorious action of generosity.</p>
<p>“What does meritorious action consisting in equilibrium mean? When there is someone who does not deprive of life, does not steal and is always possessed of modesty and conscientiousness; who does not take delight in evil thoughts, is not a thief, is much given to generosity towards people and who is no miser; whose speech is conciliatory, refined and not offending anybody; who, living the holy life, does not practise sexual intercourse; who is content with <span class="supplied">just keeping</span> his own body <span class="supplied">going</span>; who does not tell lies, always paying attention to being absolutely honest, without cheating or lying; who is neither elated nor dejected <span class="supplied">because of</span> that which the worldling esteems; who, not taking intoxicants, never fails to avoid stupefaction; who, furthermore, suffuses one quarter <span class="supplied">of the cardinal points</span> with friendliness, two quarters, three, four quarters, and also the quarters of the intermediate points of the compass, the zenith and nadir, who suffuses the whole <span class="supplied">world</span>, boundlessly, without limits and absolutely beyond measure; who causes with a heart <span class="supplied">full</span> of friendliness everything to be enveloped and <span class="supplied">thus</span> realises peace of mind; who, moreover, suffuses one quarter <span class="supplied">of the cardinal points</span> with a heart <span class="supplied">full</span> of compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity, two quarters … ; who suffuses the whole <span class="supplied">world</span> with a heart <span class="supplied">full of </span> compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity—this is what is called the meritorious action of equilibrium.</p>
<p>“What does the existential constituent ‘meritorious action consisting in <span class="supplied">wise</span> reflection’ mean? When there is a monk who, given to practice, is intent on recollection and perfect awakening; who does to succumb to attachment and in whom deliberation has ceased; who relies on giving up, and on what necessarily leads to <span class="supplied">ultimate</span> release; who, practising the <i>dharma</i> ‘being intent on perfect awakening’ is intent on recollection and perfect awakening, on perfect awakening <span class="supplied">by means of</span> an exclamation, on perfect awakening <span class="supplied">by means of</span> the absorptions and <span class="supplied">by means of</span> restraint; who does not succumb to attachment … relies on … what necessarily leads to <span class="supplied">ultimate</span> release—this is what is called the meritorious action of <span class="supplied">wise</span> reflection. These are, monks, the three kinds of meritorious action.” Then the Exalted One uttered the following verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Generosity and equilibrium—friendliness … and<br>
Nurturing <span class="supplied">wise</span> reflection—these are the three basics;<br>
The wise set great store by them; here and now they<br>
Reap the rewards which, of course, <span class="supplied">ensure</span> heavenly<br>
Existence. By means of these three basics one will,<br>
Beyond any doubt, be born among the gods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Therefore, monks, one should be intent on skill in means as a <span class="supplied">guide-</span>rope to these three basics. Thus monks, you should train.” </p>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the monks were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
