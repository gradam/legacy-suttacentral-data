<h1>2.37 The Five Awarenesses Produced by Different Karma</h1>
</div>
<p>The king again asked Nāgasena, “Are the five awarenesses (ayatanas) of a person produced by various actions or by one action?”</p>
<p>Nāgasena replied, “They are produced by various actions, not by one action. It is just like when five kinds of seeds have been sown in a field, they would grow each according to its own kind. So are the five awarenesses of a person, they are produced by various actions.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
