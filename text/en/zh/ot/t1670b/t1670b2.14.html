<h1>2.14 Wisdom</h1>
</div>
<p>The king asked, “What is the characteristic mark of wisdom?” Nāgasena said, “I have already told you before, if a person has wisdom, he can cut off all the doubts, and can distinguish what is meritorious. This is wisdom.”</p>
<p>Nāgasena gave a simile, “It is like a person entering a dark room with light in hand, as soon as the light enters the room, the darkness disappears. So a person is endowed with wisdom is like a bright light. The person who is endowed with wisdom can cut off all evils, just like a person who cuts down the trees with a sharp knife. <a class="t" id="t708c"></a> For worldlings, wisdom is of prime importance. A person endowed with wisdom is able to transcend the suffering of samsara.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
