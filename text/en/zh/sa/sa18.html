<span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was
staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time a
certain monk rose up from his seat, bared his right shoulder, paid homage to
the Buddha and withdrew to stand at one side.
<a class="t" id="4a"></a>
He said to the Buddha:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“It would be well if the Blessed One would teach me the essentials of the
Dharma in brief. On having heard the Dharma I shall alone and in a quiet
place reflect on it with energy. Being established in it without negligence
… up to … knowing myself that there will be no receiving of any further
existence.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
The Buddha said to that monk: “It is well, it is well, that you speak like
this: ‘Blessed One, teach me the essentials of the Dharma in brief. On
having heard the Dharma, I shall alone and in a quiet place reflect on it
with energy. Being established in it without negligence … up to … knowing
myself that there will be no receiving of any further existence.’ Is it like
this?” Then that monk said to the Buddha: “It is like this, Blessed One.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
The Buddha said to the monk: “Listen, listen and pay careful attention to
what I will tell you. Whatever does not belong to you and does not belong to
others, these things should quickly be eradicated and relinquished. Having
eradicated those things will be for your benefit and welfare, for your peace
and happiness for a long time.” Then that monk said to the Buddha: “I
understood, Blessed One, I understood Well Gone One!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
The Buddha said to the monk: “How do you understand in full the meaning of
the teaching I herein spoke in brief?” The monk said to the Buddha: “Blessed
One, form is not self, it does not belong to me and does not belong to
others. This thing should quickly be eradicated and relinquished. Having
eradicated that thing will be for my benefit and welfare, for my peace for a
long time. In the same way feeling … perception … formations … consciousness
is not self, it does not belong to me and does not belong to others. It
should quickly be eradicated and relinquished. Having eradicated that thing
will be for my benefit and welfare, for my peace and happiness for a long
time. Blessed One, I thus understand in full the meaning of the teaching
herein spoken in brief.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>
The Buddha said to the monk: “It is well, it is well, how you understand in
full the meaning of the teaching I herein spoke in brief. Why is that? Monk,
form is not self, it does not belong to oneself and does not belong to
others. This thing should quickly be eradicated and relinquished. Having
eradicated that thing will be for one’s benefit and welfare, for one’s peace
and happiness for a long time. In the same way feeling … perception …
formations … consciousness is not self, it does not belong to oneself and
does not belong to others. This thing should quickly be eradicated and
relinquished. Having eradicated that thing will be for one’s benefit and
welfare, for one’s peace and happiness for a long time.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>
Then, on hearing what the Buddha had said, the mind of that monk was
greatly delighted. He paid homage to the Buddha and withdrew. Practising
alone in a quiet place with diligence he was established in it without
negligence … up to … he himself knew that there will be no receiving of any
further existence. Then that monk, attaining liberation of the mind, became
an arahant.</p>
