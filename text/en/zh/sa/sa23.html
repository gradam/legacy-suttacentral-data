<span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was
staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Feeding Place. At
that time the venerable Rāhula approached the Buddha, paid homage with his
head at the [Buddha’s] feet and withdrew to stand at one side. He said to
the Buddha:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“Blessed One, knowing what, seeing what in relation to this body of mine
with consciousness and [in relation to] external objects and any sign will
it be possible that there is no [sense of an] I, of viewing as mine or of
the underlying tendency, fetter and attachment to the I-conceit?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
The Buddha said to Rāhula: “It is well, it is well, that you are able to
ask the Tathāgata: ‘Knowing what, seeing what in relation to this body of
mine with consciousness and [in relation to] external objects and any sign
will there be no [sense of an] I, of viewing as mine or of the underlying
tendency, fetter and attachment to the I-conceit?’ Is it like this?” Rāhula
said to the Buddha: “It is like this, Blessed One.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
The Buddha said to Rāhula: “It is well. Listen, listen and pay careful
attention to what I will tell you. Rāhula, you should contemplate whatever
form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or
subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all such [form], every instance
of it, is not self, is not distinct from the self [in the sense of being
owned by it], does not exist [within the self nor does a self] exist [within
it]. In this way it should be rightly contemplated with balanced wisdom.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
“In the same way [whatever] feeling … perception … formations …
consciousness, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross
or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all such [consciousness],
every instance of it, is not self, is not distinct from the self [in the
sense of being owned by it], does not exist [within the self nor does a
self] exist [within it]. In this way it should be contemplated with balanced
wisdom as it really is.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>
“In this way, Rāhula, a monk knows like this and sees like this. For one
who knows like this and sees like this in relation to this body with
consciousness and [in relation to] external objects and any sign there will
be no [sense of an] I, viewing as mine or underlying tendency, fetter and
attachment to the I-conceit.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>
“Rāhula, if in this way for a monk in relation to this body with
consciousness and [in relation to] external objects and any sign there is no
[sense of an] I,
<a class="t" id="5b"></a>
viewing as mine or underlying tendency, fetter and attachment to the
I-conceit, that monk is reckoned to have eradicated craving and desire, to
have turned around and left all bondage, rightly comprehending the
unsurpassed transcendence of <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>
Then Rāhula, hearing what the Buddha had said, was delighted and received
it respectfully.</p>
