<h1>67. <span class="supplied">Discourse on Delighting</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “You should constantly cultivate meditation with diligence, calm the mind within. Why is that? Monks, having cultivated meditation with diligence and calmed the mind within, one examines <span class="supplied">the aggregates</span> as they really are.</p>
<p>“How to examine <span class="supplied">the aggregates</span> as they really are? By understanding as it really is: ‘This is bodily form, this is the arising of bodily form, this is the cessation of bodily form. This is feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, this is the arising of consciousness, this is the cessation of consciousness.’</p>
<p>“What is the arising of bodily form, the arising of feeling … of perception … of formations … of consciousness? A foolish unlearned worldling does not understand as it really is the arising of bodily form, the cessation of bodily form, the gratification of bodily form, the danger in bodily form, and the escape from bodily form. Because of not understanding it as it really is, he delights with attachment in that bodily form, he commends bodily form. Because of delighting with attachment in bodily form and commending bodily form, there is clinging. In dependence on clinging, there is becoming. In dependence on becoming, there is birth. In dependence on birth, there is old age, <span class="supplied">disease</span>, death, worry, sorrow, vexation, and pain. In this way this entire great mass of <i>dukkha</i> arises. This is called the arising of bodily form, the arising of feeling … of perception … of formations … of consciousness.</p>
<p>“What is the cessation of bodily form, the cessation of feeling … of perception … of formations … of consciousness? A learned noble disciple understands as it really is the arising of bodily form, the cessation of bodily form, the gratification of bodily form, the danger in bodily form, and the escape from bodily form. Because of understanding it as it really is, he does not delight with attachment in bodily form, he does not commend bodily form. Because of not delighting with attachment in bodily form and commending it, craving and delight cease. Because of the cessation of craving and delight, clinging ceases. Because of the cessation of clinging, becoming ceases. Because of the cessation of becoming, birth ceases. Because of the cessation of birth, old age, disease, death, worry, sorrow, vexation, and pain cease. In this way this entire great mass of <i>dukkha</i> ceases.</p>

Monks, this is called the cessation of bodily form, the cessation of feeling … of perception … of formations … of consciousness.</p>
<p>“Monks, you should constantly cultivate meditation with diligence, calm the mind within.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
<p><i>As for</i> ‘examining’ <i>… up to …</i> ‘realizing’, <i>twelve discourses should be recited fully in the same way</i>.</p>
