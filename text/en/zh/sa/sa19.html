<span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was
staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. A that time a
certain monk rose up from his seat, paid homage to the Buddha and said to
the Buddha:
<a class="t" id="4b"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“[May] the Blessed One teach me the essentials of the Dharma in brief. On
having heard the Dharma I shall alone and in a quiet place reflect on it
with energy, being established in it without negligence. Having become
established in it without negligence, I shall reflect on that for whose sake
a clansman’s son out of right faith goes forth from the home to homelessness
… up to … I myself know that there will be no receiving of any further
existence.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
At that time the Blessed One said to that monk: “It is well, it is well,
that you speak like this: ‘It would be well if the Blessed One would teach
me the essentials of the Dharma in brief. On having heard the Dharma, I
shall alone and in a quiet place reflect on it with energy, being
established in it without negligence … up to … knowing myself that there
will be no receiving of any further existence.’ Is it like this?” The monk
said to the Buddha: “It is like this, Blessed One.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
The Buddha said to the monk: “Listen, listen and pay careful attention to
what I will tell you. Monk, the fetters and what has the nature of putting
you in bondage should quickly be relinquished and eradicated. Having
eradicated that thing will be for your benefit and welfare, for your peace
and happiness for a long time.” Then that monk said to the Buddha: “I
understood, Blessed One, I understood Well Gone One!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
The Buddha said to the monk: “How do you understand in full the meaning of
the teaching I herein spoke in brief?” The monk said to the Buddha: “Blessed
One, form is a fetter and has the nature of putting me in bondage. This
fetter and its nature of putting me in bondage should quickly be
relinquished and eradicated. Having eradicated that thing will be for my
benefit and welfare, for my peace and happiness for a long time. In the same
way feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is a fetter and has
the nature of putting me in bondage. This fetter and its nature of putting
me in bondage should quickly be relinquished and eradicated. Having
eradicated that thing will be for my benefit and welfare, for my peace for a
long time. Blessed One, I thus understand in full the meaning of the
teaching herein spoken in brief.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>
The Buddha said to the monk: “It is well, it is well, that you understand
in full the meaning of the teaching I herein spoke in brief. Why is that?
Form is a fetter and has the nature of putting you in bondage. This thing
should quickly be relinquished and eradicated. Having eradicated that thing
will be for your benefit and welfare, for your peace and happiness for a
long time. In the same way feeling … perception … formations … consciousness
is a fetter and has the nature of putting you in bondage. This thing should
quickly be relinquished and eradicated. Having eradicated that thing will be
for your benefit and welfare, for your peace for a long time.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>
Then, on hearing what the Buddha had said, the mind of that monk was
greatly delighted. He paid homage to the Buddha and withdrew. Reflecting on
it alone in a quiet place with diligence he was established in it without
negligence … up to attaining liberation of the mind he became an arahant.</p>
