<h2>Samyuktāgama 32</h2>
<h1>[Third Discourse to Soṇa]</h1>
</hgroup>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
<span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was
staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Feeding Place. At
that time the venerable Sāriputta was on Mount Vulture Peak. Then a
householder’s son by the name of Soṇa, who every day used to roam around,
reached Mount Vulture Peak and approached Sāriputta. He paid homage with his
head [at Sāriputta’s feet] and withdrew to sit at one side.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
Then Sāriputta said to Soṇa: “If recluses and brahmins do not know form as
it really is, do not know the arising of form as it really is, do not know
the cessation of form as it really is, do not know the gratification of form
as it really is, do not know the danger of form as it really is, do not know
the escape from form as it really is, then for this reason they are not able
to transcend form.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“If recluses and brahmins do not know feeling … perception … formations …
consciousness as it really is, do not know the arising of consciousness as
it really is, do not know the cessation of consciousness as it really is, do
not know the gratification of consciousness as it really is, do not know the
danger of consciousness as it really is, do not know the escape from
consciousness as it really is, then for this reason these recluses and
brahmins are not able to transcend consciousness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
“If recluses and brahmins know form … the arising of form … the cessation
of form … the gratification of form … the danger of form … the escape from
form as it really is, then these recluses and brahmins are able to transcend
form.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
“If recluses and brahmins know feeling … perception … formations …
consciousness … the arising of consciousness … the cessation of
consciousness … the gratification of consciousness … the danger of
consciousness… the escape from consciousness as it really is, then these
recluses and brahmins are able to transcend consciousness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>
“Soṇa, what do you think, is form permanent or is it impermanent?” [Soṇa]
replied: “It is impermanent.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>
[Sāriputta asked]: “What is impermanent, is it <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>?”
[Soṇa] replied: “It is <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>
[Sāriputta asked]: “Soṇa, form that is impermanent, <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>
, of a nature to change, would a noble disciple herein [regard] it as self,
as distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it], as existing
[within the self, or the self] as existing [within it]?” [Soṇa] replied:
“No.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>
[Sāriputta asked]: “Soṇa, in the same way, what do you think, feeling …
perception … formations … consciousness, is it permanent or impermanent?”
[Soṇa] replied:
<a class="t" id="7b"></a>
“It is impermanent.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>
[Sāriputta asked]: “What is impermanent, is it <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>?”
[Soṇa] replied: “It is <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>
[Sāriputta asked]: “Soṇa, what is impermanent, <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>, of
a nature to change, would a noble disciple herein [regard] it as self, as
distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it], as existing
[within the self, or the self] as existing [within it]?” [Soṇa] replied:
“No.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>
[Sāriputta said]: “Soṇa you should know that [whatever] form, whether past,
future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or
repugnant, far or near, all such form is not self, is not distinct from the
self [in the sense of being owned by it], does not exist [within the self
nor does a self] exist [within it]. This is reckoned knowing it as it really
is.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a>
“Soṇa [whatever] feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, whether
past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or
repugnant, far or near, all such consciousness is not self, is not distinct
from the self [in the sense of being owned by it], does not exist [within
the self nor does a self] exist [within it]. This is reckoned knowing it as
it really is.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a>
“Soṇa, a noble disciple rightly contemplates these five aggregates of
clinging as not self and not mine. Rightly contemplating in this way he does
not grasp at anything in the world. One who does not grasp is not attached
to anything. One who is not attached to anything attains Nirvāṇa himself,
[knowing]: ‘Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been
established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there
will be no receiving of any further existence.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a>
Then Soṇa, hearing what Sāriputta had said, was thrilled with delight, paid
homage and left.</p>
