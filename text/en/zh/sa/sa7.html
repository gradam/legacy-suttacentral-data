<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the Blessed One said to the monks:</p>

<p>“One who craves for and delights in bodily form, craves for and delights in <i>dukkha</i>. One who craves for and delights in <i>dukkha</i> will not attain liberation from <i>dukkha</i>. <em>In the same way</em> one who craves for and delights in feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, craves for and delights in <i>dukkha</i>. One who craves for and delights in <i>dukkha</i> will not attain liberation from <i>dukkha</i>.</p>

<p>“Monks, one who does not crave for or delight in bodily form, does not delight in <i>dukkha</i>. One who does not delight in <i>dukkha</i> will attain liberation from <i>dukkha</i>. <em>In the same way</em> one who does not crave for or delight in feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, does not delight in <i>dukkha</i>. One who does not delight in <i>dukkha</i> will attain liberation from <i>dukkha.</i>”</p>

<p>Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
