<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the Blessed One said to the monks:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“One who craves for and delights in form, craves for and delights in <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>. One who craves for and delights in <i lang="pi">dukkha</i> will not attain liberation from <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>. In the same way one who craves for and delights in feeling … perception … formations … consciousness craves for and delights in <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>. One who craves for and delights in <i lang="pi">dukkha</i> will not attain liberation from <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Monks, one who does not crave for or delight in form, does not delight in <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>. One who does not delight in <i lang="pi">dukkha</i> will attain liberation from <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>. In the same way one who does not crave for or delight in feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, does not delight in <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>. One who does not delight in <i lang="pi">dukkha</i> will attain liberation from <i lang="pi">dukkha.</i>“</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
