<span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was
staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Feeding Place. At
that time the venerable Sāriputta was on Mount Vulture Peak. Then a
householder’s son by the name of Soṇa, who every day used to roam around,
reached Mount Vulture Peak and approached the venerable Sāriputta. Having
exchanged polite greetings he withdrew to sit at one side. He said to
Sāriputta:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“If recluses and brahmins in regard to form which is impermanent and
changing, form which is not stable, say: ‘I am superior, I am equal, I am
inferior’; why do these recluses and brahmins have such a perception and do
not see the truth?
<a class="t" id="6b"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“If recluses and brahmins in regard to feeling … perception … formations …
consciousness, which is impermanent and changing, which is not stable, say:
‘I am superior, I am equal, I am inferior’; why do these recluses and
brahmins have such a perception and do not see the truth?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
“If recluses and brahmins in regard to form which is impermanent and not
stable, form which is changing, say: ‘I am superior, I am equal, I am
inferior’; why do they imagine [like this] and do not see the truth? In
regard to feeling … perception … formations … consciousness which is
impermanent and changing, which is not stable, they say: ‘I am superior, I
am equal, I am inferior’. Why do they imagine [like this] and do not see the
truth?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
[Sāriputta asked]: “Soṇa, what do you think, is form permanent or is it
impermanent?” [Soṇa] replied: “It is impermanent.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>
[Sāriputta asked]: “Soṇa, what is impermanent, is it <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>
?” [Soṇa] replied: “It is <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>
[Sāriputta asked]: “Soṇa, what is impermanent, <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>, of
a nature to change, what do you think, does a noble disciple herein regard
such form as self, as distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by
it], as existing [within the self, or the self] as existing [within it]?”
[Soṇa] replied: “No.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>
[Sāriputta asked]: “Soṇa, what do you think, is feeling … perception …
formations … consciousness permanent or is it impermanent?” [Soṇa] replied:
“It is impermanent.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>
[Sāriputta asked]: “What is impermanent, is it <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>?”
[Soṇa] replied: “It is <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>
[Sāriputta asked]: “Soṇa, consciousness that is impermanent,
<i lang="pi">dukkha</i>, of a nature to change, what do you think, does a
noble disciple herein regard such consciousness as self, as distinct from
the self [in the sense of being owned by it], as existing [within the self,
or the self] as existing [within it]?” [Soṇa] replied: “No.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>
[Sāriputta said]: “Soṇa you should know that [whatever] form, whether past,
future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or
repugnant, far or near, all such form is not self, is not distinct from the
self [in the sense of being owned by it], does not exist [within the self
nor does a self] exist [within it]. This is reckoned knowing it as it really
is.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>
“In the same way [whatever] feeling … perception … formations …
consciousness, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross
or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all such consciousness is not
self, is not distinct from the self [in the sense of being owned by it],
does not exist [within the self nor does a self] exist [within it]. This is
reckoned knowing it as it really is.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a>
“Soṇa, in this way arouse disenchantment in regard to form … feeling …
perception … formations … consciousness, be free from desire for it and
become liberated. Being liberated you will know and see that: ‘Birth for me
has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done
has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of any further
existence.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a>
When Sāriputta had spoken this discourse, the householder’s son Soṇa
attained the pure eye of Dharma that is remote from [mental] stains and free
from [mental] dust. Then the householder’s son Soṇa saw the Dharma and
attained the Dharma, not needing to rely on others he had attained
fearlessness in the right Dharma. He rose from his seat, arranged his
clothes so as to bare the right shoulder, knelt down and with palms together
said to Sāriputta:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a>
“I have now crossed over. From now on I take refuge in the Buddha, I take
refuge in the Dharma and take refuge in the Saṅgha as a lay follower.
<a class="t" id="6c"></a>
From today until the end of my life I purely take refuge in the three
jewels.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a>
Then the householder’s son Soṇa, hearing what Sāriputta had said, was
thrilled with delight, paid homage and left.</p>
