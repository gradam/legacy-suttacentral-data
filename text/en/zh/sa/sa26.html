<h1>26. <span class="supplied">Discourse on Teaching the Dharma Well</span></h1>

<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time a certain monk approached the Buddha, paid homage with his head at the <span class="supplied">Buddha’s</span> feet and withdrew to stand at one side. He said to the Buddha: “As the Blessed One has spoken about being a Dharma teacher—how is one reckoned a Dharma teacher?”</p>

<p>The Buddha said to the monk: “It is well, it is well. You now wish to know the meaning of what the Tathāgata has spoken about as a Dharma teacher. Is it like this?” The monk said to the Buddha: “Indeed, Blessed One.”</p>

<p>The Buddha said to the monk: “Listen and pay careful attention to what I will tell you.” The Buddha said to the monk: “If by teaching about bodily form disenchantment arises, one is free from desire for <span class="supplied">bodily form</span> and there is cessation and a state of peace, this is reckoned as being a Dharma teacher. If by teaching about feeling … perception … formations … consciousness disenchantment arises, one is free from desire for <span class="supplied">consciousness</span> and there is cessation and a state of peace, this is reckoned as being a Dharma teacher. This is reckoned what the Tathāgata declares to be a Dharma teacher.”</p>

<p>Then that monk, hearing what the Buddha had said, was thrilled with delight, paid homage and left.</p>
