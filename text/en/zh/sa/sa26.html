<span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was
staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time a
certain monk approached the Buddha, paid homage with his head at the
[Buddha’s] feet and withdrew to stand at one side. He said to the Buddha:
“As the Blessed One has spoken about being a Dharma teacher how is one
reckoned a Dharma teacher?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
The Buddha said to the monk: “It is well, it is well. You now wish to know
the meaning of what the Tathāgata has spoken about as a Dharma teacher. Is
it like this?” The monk said to the Buddha: “Indeed, Blessed One.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
The Buddha said to the monk: “Listen and pay careful attention to what I
will tell you.” The Buddha said to the monk: “If by teaching about form
disenchantment arises, one is free from desire for [form] and there is
cessation and a state of peace, this is reckoned being a Dharma teacher. If
by teaching about feeling … perception … formations … consciousness
disenchantment arises, one is free from desire for [consciousness] and there
is cessation and a state of peace, this is reckoned being a Dharma teacher.
This is reckoned what the Tathāgata declares to be a Dharma teacher.”</p>

Then that monk, hearing what the Buddha had said, was thrilled with
delight, paid homage and left.</p>
