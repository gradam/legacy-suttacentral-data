At one time, the Buddha was staying in the cow-tending community of the
Kurus. At that time, a certain monk came to where the Buddha was, prostrated
with his head and touched the feet of the Buddha, stepped back, and sat down
at one side.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
He said to the Buddha: “World-Honoured One, that which is called the dharma
of conditioned arising, was it made by the World-Honoured One, or by others?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
The Buddha said to the monk: “Conditioned arising was neither made by me,
nor made by others. Whether a Tathāgata arises in the world or not, this
element of dharma remains unchanging. The Tathāgata, who has by himself
become enlightened regarding this dharma, who has attained the highest
enlightenment, he distinguishes it for all living beings, he declares it,
develops it, reveals it, namely: Because this exists, that exists; because
this arises, that arises; that is to say: Conditioned by ignorance are
activities, and so on …, and thus arises this whole mass of suffering. When
ignorance ceases, activities cease, and so on …, and thus ceases this whole
mass of suffering.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
When the Buddha had taught this discourse, that monk, having heard what the
Buddha had said, was delighted, and put it into practice.</p>
