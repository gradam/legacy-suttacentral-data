<h1>25. <span class="supplied">Discourse on Being Learned</span></h1>
</div>

<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then a certain monk approached the Buddha, paid homage to the Buddha and withdrew to stand at one side. <a class="t">5c</a> He said to the Buddha: “As the Blessed One has spoken about being learned—how does one <span class="supplied">become</span> learned?”</p>

<p>The Buddha said to the monk: “It is well, it is well. You are now asking me the meaning of being learned. Is it like this?” The monk said to the Buddha: “Indeed, Blessed One.”</p>

<p>The Buddha said to the monk: “Listen and pay careful attention to what I will tell you. Monk, you should know that hearing whereby disenchantment with bodily form arises, whereby one is free from desire for it, whereby there is cessation and a state of peace, this is reckoned as being learned. <em>In the same way</em> hearing whereby disenchantment with feeling … perception … formations … consciousness arises, whereby one is free from desire for it, whereby there is cessation and a state of peace, this is reckoned as being learned. Monk, this is reckoned what the Tathāgata declares to be learned.”</p>

<p>Then that monk, hearing what the Buddha had said, was thrilled with delight, paid homage and left.</p>
