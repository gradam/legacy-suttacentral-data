<span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was
staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the
Blessed One said to the monks:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“If living beings did not find gratification in form, they would not get
defiled by form. Because living beings find gratification in form, they are
defiled [by form] and attached [to it]. In the same way, if living beings
did not find gratification in feeling … perception … formations …
consciousness, they would not get defiled by consciousness. Because living
beings find gratification in feeling … perception … formations …
consciousness, they are defiled by consciousness and attached [to it].</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“Monks, if living beings did not experience the danger in form, those
living beings would not become disenchanted with form. Because living beings
[experience] the danger in form, those living beings become disenchanted
with form. In the same way, if they did not experience the danger in feeling
… perception … formations … consciousness, those living beings would not
become disenchanted with consciousness. Because living beings [experience]
the danger in feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, those
living beings become disenchanted with consciousness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
“Monks, if for living beings there were no escape from form, those living
beings would not escape from form. Because for living beings there is an
escape from form, those living beings escape from form. In the same way, if
for living beings there were no escape from feeling … perception …
formations … consciousness, those living beings would not escape from
consciousness. Because for living beings there is an escape from feeling …
perception … formations … consciousness, those living beings escape from
consciousness.
<a class="t" id="2c"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
“Monks, as [long as] I had not understood as it really is the gratification
in relation to the five aggregates of clinging as gratification, the danger
as danger and the escape as escape, among gods, Māra, Brahmā, recluses,
brahmins and the assemblies of gods and men I was not liberated, had not
gone beyond, was not released, was forever dwelling in [mental] distortion
and was unable to declare of myself to have attained supreme and right
awakening.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>
“Monks, because I had understood as it really is the gratification in
relation to the five aggregates of clinging as gratification, the danger as
danger and the escape as escape, among gods, Māra, Brahmā, recluses,
brahmins and the assemblies of gods and men I was able to declare to have
attained liberation, to have attained the going beyond, to have attained
escape and to have attained liberation from the fetters, to be forever not
dwelling in [mental] distortion and I was able to declare of myself to have
attained supreme and right awakening.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>
Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and
received it respectfully.</p>
