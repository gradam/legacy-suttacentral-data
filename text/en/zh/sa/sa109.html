<h1><span class="supplied">The Discourse on Not-self</span></h1>
</div>
<h2><a href="#toc" id="m1"><span class="supplied">Introduction</span></a></h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. Once the Awakened One lived at Srāvasti’s greater-metropolitan-area, in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastry. At that time the World Honoured One said to the mendicants:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“It is as if there were a pond, yojana square and just as deep and it were filled to the brim with water and there were a wise man who used a hair, blade of grass or fingernail in order to pick up a drop of that water. Mendicants, what do you think? That wise man’s water drop is more, or the pond’s water is more?” The mendicants explained to the Awakened One: “The water taken by that wise man using a hair, blade of grass or fingernail is less. So little it’s not worth mentioning. The pond’s water is a million times more. It is incomparable.” “If so, mendicants, seeing the truth, which cuts all suffering, in not coming to the world, never to become again, is like this pond of water.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>When the World Honoured One had said this dhamma, he entered his residence and sat in meditation.</p>
<h2><a href="#toc" id="m2"><span class="supplied">Venerable Śāriputra</span></a></h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>Venerable Śāriputra was sitting in the crowd and after the World Honoured One entered his residence, <span class="supplied">Śāriputra</span> said to the mendicants:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Today the World Honoured One has proclaimed the pond simile, which has never been heard. Why is that? <span class="supplied">So</span> noble disciples possessing enough insight may realise the immediate complete fruit.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“If <span class="supplied">these</span> common unrefined and evil collections of views arise, collections of views rooted in the past, collections of views about arising and collections of views about production, they are <span class="supplied">all</span> depressed, mournful, destitute and convoluted. To celebrate the auspicious and protect <span class="supplied">against</span> regret, see: the self view, the all is produced view and conceit. Like this those evils are all given up and destroyed, cut off at the root like the palm tree not to arise again in the future.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“Mendicants, what is seeing the truth? Noble disciples <span class="supplied">it is</span> cutting all the above evils never to arise again in the future.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“The foolish unlearned worldling sees form is self, form is other than self, form is in self, <span class="supplied">or</span> self is in form.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>“He sees feeling…, perception…, formulation… and consciousness is self, …is other than self, …is in self or self is in …consciousness.</p>
<h2><a href="#toc" id="m3"><span class="supplied">Form</span></a></h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>“What is seeing form is self? <span class="supplied">It is</span> having rightly examined the earth whole element and having these thoughts: earth indeed is self, self indeed is earth, self and the earth are one not two, not other not separate. So also with water, fire and wind. Blue, yellow, red and white whole elements, having rightly examined, having these thoughts: activities indeed are self, self is activities, <span class="supplied">they</span> are one not two, not other not separate. So also regard all the elements each one is counted as self. That is what is called form is indeed self.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>“What is seeing form is other than self? If he sees feeling is self, having seen feeling as self he sees form is that which <span class="supplied">belongs to</span> self, or he sees perception, formulation or consciousness is indeed self. Seeing form is that which <span class="supplied">belongs to</span> self.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>“What is seeing within self is form? It is seeing feeling is self. Form is in self. Again seeing perception, formulation or consciousness is indeed self and form is in self.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a>“What is seeing within form is self? It is seeing feeling is indeed self. It abides within form. It enters in form surrounded by those four substances. Seeing perception, formulation and consciousness is self abiding in form surrounded by those four substances. That is called within form is self.</p>
<h2><a href="#toc" id="m4"><span class="supplied">Feeling</span></a></h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a>“What is seeing feeling is indeed self? It is the six categories of feeling. Feeling conditioned by the eye. Feeling conditioned by the ear, nose, tongue, body and mind. These are the six categories of feeling. Each one is seen as self. Self is feeling. This is called feeling is indeed self.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a>“What is seeing feeling is other than self? It is seeing form is <span class="supplied">that</span> which <span class="supplied">belongs to</span> self. It is <span class="supplied">seeing</span> perception, formulation and consciousness is self and feeling is <span class="supplied">that</span> which <span class="supplied">belongs to</span> self. That is called feeling is other than self.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a>“What is seeing within self is feeling? It is seeing form is self and feeling is in it. <span class="supplied">It is seeing</span> perception, formulation or consciousness is self and feeling is in it.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a>“What is seeing within feeling is self? It is <span class="supplied">seeing</span> form is self. It abides within feeling surrounded by those four substances. <span class="supplied">Seeing</span> perception, formulation and consciousness is self abiding in feeling surrounded by those four substances. That is called within feeling is self.</p>
<h2><a href="#toc" id="m5"><span class="supplied">Perception</span></a></h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a>“What is called seeing perception is indeed self? That is called the six categories of ideas. Perception conditioned by the eye. Perception conditioned by the ear, nose, tongue, body and mind. These are the six categories of perception. Each and every view of self is just called the perception ‘This is self’.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a>“What is seeing perception is other than self? It is called seeing form is self, perception is belonging to self, <span class="supplied">feeling…, formulation…,</span> consciousness is self, perception is belonging to self. This is called perception is other than self.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a>“What is seeing within self is perception? It is called <span class="supplied">seeing</span> form is self and formulation is in it and feeling…, perception… and consciousness is self. Formulation is in it.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="22"></a>“What is seeing within perception is self? It is called <span class="supplied">seeing</span> form is self. It abides in perception surrounded by those four substances. <span class="supplied"><span class="supplied">Seeing</span> feeling, formulation and consciousness is self abiding in perception surrounded by those four substances.</span> That is called within perception is self.</p>
<h2><a href="#toc" id="m6"><span class="supplied">Formulation</span></a></h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="23"></a>“What is called seeing formulation is indeed self? That is called the six categories of volition. Volition conditioned by the eye. Volition conditioned by the ear, nose, tongue, body and mind. <span class="supplied">When</span> in these six categories of volition each and every one is seen as self, it is called ‘Formulation is self’.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="24"></a>“What is seeing formulation is other than self? It is called seeing form is self, formulation is belonging to self, feeling…, perception…, consciousness is self, formulation is belonging to self. This is called formulation is other than self.</p>

It is called feeling, perception and consciousness is self. In formulation it abides, surrounded by those four substances. That is called within formulation is self.</p>
<h2><a href="#toc" id="m7"><span class="supplied">Consciousness</span></a></h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="27"></a>“What is called seeing consciousness is indeed self? That is called the six categories of consciousness. Eye consciousness, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind consciousness categories. <span class="supplied">When</span> in these six categories of consciousness each and every one is seen as self, it is called ‘Consciousness indeed is self’.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="28"></a>“What is seeing consciousness is other than self? It is called <span class="supplied">seeing</span> form is self, consciousness is belonging to self, seeing feeling…, perception…, formulation is self, consciousness is belonging to self. This is called consciousness is other than self.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="30"></a>“What is <span class="supplied">seeing</span> within consciousness is self? It is called <span class="supplied">seeing</span> form is self. It abides in consciousness surrounded by those four substances. It is called feeling, perception and formulation is self. In consciousness it abides, surrounded by those four substances. That is called within consciousness is self.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="31"></a>“Like this the noble disciple see the four real truths and realises the immediate same fruit, cuts off all wicked views, will not come to the world <span class="supplied">again</span> and will never arise again. Whatever form there exists, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, good or ugly, far or near, examine all always like this: all are impermanent, all are suffering, all are empty, all are not self and ought not to be delighted in, taken in or cherished. Feeling, perception, formulation and consciousness are also like this and ought not to be delighted in, taken in or cherished. Examine wisely like this.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="32"></a>“Unite the mind with wisdom, re-examine dhammas diligently, separate <span class="supplied">yourself from</span> all negligence, realise happiness of body and mind, breathe gently and contentedly dwell in renunciation, practice all the grades of the path fully, forever separated from all evil, not not to vanish, to melt, not not to desolate, destroyed. Destroyed not to arise. Reduced not to increase. Cut off not to arise. Not to cling to and not to hold onto. Having realised extingishment oneself ‘Birth for me has stopped. The holy life is established. Done is what was to be done. I know I will not receive future becomings.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="33"></a>When Śāriputra had taught this dhamma, sixty mendicants ended all taints, <span class="supplied">their</span> minds attained liberation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="34"></a>When The Awakened One had taught this discourse, the mendicants heard what the Awakened One had taught and happily practised.</p>
