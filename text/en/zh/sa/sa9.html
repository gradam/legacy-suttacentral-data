<span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was
staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the
Blessed One said to the monks:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“Form is impermanent, what is impermanent is <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>, what
is <i lang="pi">dukkha</i> is not-self, what is not self is not mine. One
who contemplates like this is reckoned to be contemplating truly and
rightly. In the same way feeling … perception … formations … consciousness
is impermanent, what is impermanent is <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>, what is
<i lang="pi">dukkha</i> is not-self, what is not self is not mine. One who
contemplates like this is reckoned to be contemplating truly and rightly.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“A noble disciple who contemplates like this becomes disenchanted with
form, disenchanted with feeling … perception … formations … consciousness.
Because of disenchantment he does not delight [in consciousness], because of
not delighting [in consciousness] he attains liberation. To one who is
liberated the true knowledge arises: ‘Birth for me has been eradicated, the
holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself
know that there will be no receiving of any further existence.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and
received it respectfully.</p>
