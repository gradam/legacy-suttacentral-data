<span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was
staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time a
certain monk approached the Buddha … (asking as above, with this difference):</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“One who surrenders to the underlying tendencies and surrenders to the
underlying tendency at death is reckoned [accordingly]. One who does not
surrender to the underlying tendencies and does not surrender to the
underlying tendency at death is not reckoned [accordingly]”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
The Buddha said to the monk: “How do you understand in full the meaning of
the teaching I herein spoke in brief?” Then the monk said to the Buddha:
“Blessed One, surrendering to the underlying tendencies of form one
surrenders to the underlying tendency at death. One who surrenders to the
underlying tendencies and surrenders to the underlying tendency at death is
reckoned [accordingly]. In the same way surrendering to the underlying
tendencies of feeling … perception … formations … consciousness one
surrenders to the underlying tendency at death. One who surrenders to the
underlying tendencies and surrenders to the underlying tendency at death is
reckoned [accordingly].</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
“Blessed One, if one does not surrender to the underlying tendencies of
form, one does not surrender to the underlying tendency at death. One who
does not surrender to the underlying tendencies and does not surrender to
the underlying tendency at death is not reckoned [accordingly]. In the same
way [if] one does not surrender to the underlying tendencies of feeling …
perception … formations … consciousness one does not surrender to the
underlying tendency at death. One who does not surrender to the underlying
tendencies and does not surrender to the underlying tendency at death is not
reckoned [accordingly]. Blessed One, in this way I understand in full the
meaning of the teaching herein spoken in brief.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
(In the same way up to) … became an arahant, attaining liberation of the
mind.</p>
