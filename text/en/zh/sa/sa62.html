<h1>62. <span class="supplied">Discourse on Lustful Attachment</span></h1>
</div>

<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>

<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “There are five aggregates of clinging, that is, the bodily form aggregate of clinging … the feeling … the perception … the formations … the consciousness aggregate of clinging.</p>

<p>“A foolish unlearned worldling, who is ignorant and without wisdom, in regard to the five aggregates of clinging gives rise to the view of self, which is a tie of attachment and a mental tendency to bondage that gives rise to lustful desires.</p>

<p>“Monks, a learned noble disciple, who has knowledge and wisdom, in regard to these five aggregates of clinging does not have the view of self, which is a tie of attachment and a mental tendency to bondage that gives rise to lustful desires.</p>

<p>“How does a foolish unlearned worldling, who is ignorant and without wisdom, in regard to the five aggregates of clinging have the view of self, which is a tie of attachment and a mental tendency to bondage that gives rise to lustful desires?</p>

<p>“Monks, a foolish unlearned worldling, who is ignorant and without wisdom, sees bodily form as the self, as distinct from the self <span class="supplied">in the sense of being owned by it</span>, as existing <span class="supplied">within the self, or a self</span> as existing <span class="supplied">within bodily form</span>. In the same way <span class="supplied">he sees</span> feeling … perception … formations … consciousness as the self, as distinct from the self <span class="supplied">in the sense of being owned by it</span>, as existing <span class="supplied">within the self, or a self</span> as existing <span class="supplied">within consciousness</span>. In this way a foolish unlearned worldling, who is ignorant and without wisdom, in regard to the five aggregates of clinging proclaims a self, which is a tie of attachment and a mental tendency to bondage that gives rise to lustful desires. <a class="t">16b</a></p>

<p>“Monks, how does a <span class="supplied">learned</span> noble disciple, who has knowledge and wisdom, not proclaim a self, which is a tie of attachment and a mental tendency to bondage that gives rise to lustful desires? A <span class="supplied">learned</span> noble disciple does not see bodily form as the self, as distinct from the self <span class="supplied">in the sense of being owned by it</span>, as existing <span class="supplied">within the self, or a self</span> as existing <span class="supplied">within bodily form</span>. In the same way he does not see feeling … perception … formations … consciousness as the self, as distinct from the self <span class="supplied">in the sense of being owned by it</span>, as existing <span class="supplied">within the self, or a self</span> as existing <span class="supplied">within consciousness</span>. In this way a learned noble disciple, who has knowledge and wisdom, in regard to the five aggregates of clinging does not have the view of a self, which is a tie of attachment and a mental tendency to bondage that gives rise to lustful desires.</p>

<p>“Whatever bodily form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all such <span class="supplied">bodily form</span> he rightly contemplates as all being entirely impermanent. In the same way <span class="supplied">whatever</span> feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all such <span class="supplied">consciousness</span> he rightly contemplates as all being entirely impermanent.”</p>

<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
