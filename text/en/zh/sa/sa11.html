<span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was
staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the
Blessed One said to the monks:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“Form is impermanent. The causes and conditions for the arising of any form
are also impermanent. Any form that has arisen from impermanent causes and
impermanent conditions, how could it be permanent?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“In the same way feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is
impermanent. The causes and conditions for the arising of any consciousness
are also impermanent. Any consciousness that has arisen from impermanent
causes and impermanent conditions, how could it be permanent?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
“Monks, like this form is impermanent, feeling … perception … formations …
consciousness is impermanent, what is impermanent is <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>
, what is <i lang="pi">dukkha</i> is not self, what is not self is not mine.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
“A noble disciple who contemplates like this becomes disenchanted with
form, disenchanted with feeling … perception … formations … consciousness.
One who is disenchanted does not delight [in consciousness]. Not delighting
[in consciousness] he becomes liberated.
<a class="t" id="2b"></a>
Being liberated he knows and sees: ‘Birth for me has been eradicated, the
holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself
know that there will be no receiving of any further existence.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>
Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and
received it respectfully.</p>
