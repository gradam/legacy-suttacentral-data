<h1>79. <span class="supplied">Discourse on a Brief Teaching</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “Past and future bodily form is after all impermanent, what to say of present bodily form! A learned noble disciple who examines it in this way is not concerned with past bodily form and does not rejoice in future bodily form. Being disenchanted with present bodily form, he becomes free from desire for it and proceeds towards its cessation. Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <i>are also in this way</i>.</p>
<p>“Monks, if there were no past bodily form, it would not <span class="supplied">happen that</span> the learned noble disciple is not concerned with past bodily form. Because there is past bodily form, the learned noble disciple is not concerned with past bodily form.</p>
<p>“Monks, if there were no future bodily form, it would not <span class="supplied">happen that</span> the learned noble disciple does not rejoice in future bodily form. Because there is future bodily form, the learned noble disciple does not rejoice in future bodily form.</p>
<p>“Monks, if there were no present bodily form, it would not <span class="supplied">happen that</span> the learned noble disciple gives rise to disenchantment towards present bodily form, becomes free from desire for it, and proceeds towards its cessation. Because there is present bodily form, the learned noble disciple gives rise to disenchantment towards present bodily form, becomes free from desire for it and proceeds towards its cessation. Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <i>should also be recited in the same way</i>.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
<p><i>As for</i> “impermanent“<i>, <span class="supplied">so with</span></i> “<i>dukkha</i>“, “empty” <i>and</i> “not self” <i>three discourses should be recited in the same way.</i></p>
