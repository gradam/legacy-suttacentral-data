</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>Then the Blessed One called the monks and said: ‘Monks, the results of actions that have been done and accumulated shall be experienced. And these shall be experienced either in this very lifetime or after taking rebirth or on some future occasion. Monks, I say that the results of actions that have not been done and accumulated shall not be experienced.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Furthermore, monks, there are three types of evil, unwholesome bodily actions and four <span class="supplied">evil, unwholesome</span> verbal <span class="supplied">actions</span> and three <span class="supplied">evil, unwholesome</span> mental <span class="supplied">actions</span> that are done and accumulated, <span class="supplied">which</span> will bring forth results that will be <i lang="sa">duḥkha</i> and unwholesome. Monks, what are the three evil, unwholesome bodily actions that, when done and accumulated, will bring forth results that will be <i lang="sa">duḥkha</i> and unwholesome?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>(1) Some who take the life <span class="supplied">of a living being</span>—these are those who have not abstained from taking the life <span class="supplied">of a living being</span>, are bloody-handed, have no shame in destroying and totally annihilating <span class="supplied">living beings</span>, are ruthless, put all their minds on <span class="supplied">taking</span> the life of any living beings, even as much as an ant. <a class="t" id="ttu_270b"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>2) Some who have taken what has not been given—these are those who have not abstained from taking what had not been given and who are counted among those who by going to a village or to a monastery have stolen what is not given by others.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>(3) Some who have committed sexual misconduct—these are those who have not abstained from sexual misconduct, that is, seducing <span class="supplied">a woman</span> guarded by her mother or guarded by her father or guarded by her brother or guarded by her sister or guarded by her father-in-law or guarded by her mother-in-law or guarded by her relatives or guarded by her family or guarded by her clan or <span class="supplied">a woman</span> who has been garlanded <span class="supplied">in token of betrothal and is</span> under <span class="supplied">threat of</span> punishment and veiled, because she has been <span class="supplied">already</span> obtained by somebody else and is <span class="supplied">thus</span> somebody else’s woman, or having sexual intercourse with her by overwhelming <span class="supplied">her</span>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>Monks, when these three types of evil, unwholesome bodily actions are done and accumulated, they will bring forth results that are <i lang="sa">duḥkha</i> and unwholesome.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>Monks, what are the four evil, unwholesome verbal actions that, once done and accumulated, will bring forth results that are <i lang="sa">duḥkha</i> and unwholesome?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>(1) <span class="supplied">There are</span> some who speak falsehood—these are those who have not abstained from speaking falsehood, that is, those who for their own sake or for the sake of others or for the sake of just a small share of material gain, knowingly speak falsehood, such as, be it in the king’s palace or in the minister’s hall or having gone in the midst of an assembly or having gone amidst an entourage, upon being questioned by the authority <span class="supplied">like this</span>: “Come, man, say what you do know! Don’t say what you don’t know! Say what you’ve seen! Don’t say what you haven’t seen!”, without giving wise consideration to what the authority has questioned <span class="supplied">them</span> about, they answer in response: “I know!” although they do not know and “I have seen!” although they have not seen.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>(2) <span class="supplied">There are</span> some who slander and are divisive—these are those<a class="tu"></a><a class="t" id="ttu_271a"></a> who have not abstained from slandering speech, that is, having heard <span class="supplied">something</span> from that <span class="supplied">person</span> they report it to this <span class="supplied">person</span>, and having heard <span class="supplied">something</span> from these <span class="supplied">people</span> they report <span class="supplied">it</span> to those <span class="supplied">other people</span> and the community becomes <span class="supplied">thus</span> divided, not in accord with <span class="supplied">the principle of</span> trust, undisciplined, in conflict.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>(3) <span class="supplied">There are</span> some who speak harsh speech—these are those who have abandoned <span class="supplied">types of</span> speech such as a speech that is sweet to the ear, that is pleasant and that delights the heart of others, illuminating, charming, worth hearing to, appealing to many beings, enchanting to many beings, that greatly gladdens many beings, that touches the heart of many beings, that is conducive to <span class="supplied">mental</span> equipoise, and that brings about <span class="supplied">the right mental conditions</span> for concentration. <span class="supplied">Those who speak harsh speech are then</span> those who have not abstained from harsh speech, such as a speech that is abusive and harsh, that wrenches the heart of others, that is not in harmony with others, that is disagreeable to many beings, that is repulsive to many beings, that is unpleasant to many beings, that upsets the minds of many beings, that is not conducive to <span class="supplied">mental</span> equipoise, and that does not bring about <span class="supplied">the right mental conditions</span> for meditation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>(4) <span class="supplied">There are</span> some who speak frivolous talk—these are those who have not abstained from speaking frivolous talk, that is, they speak pointless words, they speak untruthful <span class="supplied">words</span>, they speak <span class="supplied">words that are</span> not in accordance with reality, they speak <span class="supplied">words that are</span> meaningless, they speak <span class="supplied">words that are</span> not peaceful, they speak <span class="supplied">words</span> that provoke agitation and are untimely, that are not leading to discernment and that are against the Dharma, that draw together what is not the <span class="supplied">real</span> meaning. Monks, when these four evil, unwholesome verbal actions are done and accumulated, this will bring forth results that are <i lang="sa">duḥkha</i> and unwholesome.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>Monks, what are the three evil, unwholesome mental actions that, once done and accumulated, will bring forth results that are <i lang="sa">duḥkha</i> and unwholesome?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>(1) <span class="supplied">There are</span> some who are covetous—these are those who have not abstained from covetousness,<a class="tu"></a><a class="t" id="ttu_271b"></a> that is, have strong attachment to <span class="supplied">things</span> that are the objects of desire, covetousness for the material goods of another, the wealth of another and the necessities of life of another, and <span class="supplied">the wish:</span> “What if that which belongs to another would instead become mine?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a>(2) <span class="supplied">There are</span> some who have ill will—these are those who have not abstained from ill will, that is, with a poisonous mind they think such kind of thought: “May it be that all of you living beings experience failure, be defeated, encounter misfortune and loss!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a>(3) <span class="supplied">There are</span> some who have wrong view—these are those who have not abstained from wrong view, that is, holding a view that is a distorted view, they propound such statements: “There is no <span class="supplied">efficacy in</span> giving, there are no <span class="supplied">ritual</span> offerings and donations, there is no good conduct, there is no bad conduct, there is no ripening of the fruits of karma of good conduct nor of <span class="supplied">those of</span> bad conduct, there is no this world, there is no other world, there is no father, there is no mother, there are no spontaneously arisen beings, in the world there are no arhats that have rightly gone who have by themselves gained direct knowledge of this world and of the other world in their present lifetime and <span class="supplied">thus</span> attained perfect realisation <span class="supplied">being thereby able to proclaim:</span> ‘For me birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more of this hereafter.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a>Monks, when these three types of evil, unwholesome mental actions are done and accumulated, they will bring forth results that are unhappy and <i lang="sa">duḥkha</i>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a>Furthermore, monks, a noble disciple abandons unwhole—some bodily factors and develops wholesome bodily factors; he abandons unwholesome verbal and mental factors [272a] and develops wholesome verbal and mental factors:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a>With a mind imbued with benevolence (<i lang="bo">byams pa</i>, Skt. <i lang="sa">maitrī</i>), free from enmity, unsurpassed, free from ill will, vast, all—pervasive, immeasurable, well-developed, he dwells pervading one direction, and likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth <span class="supplied">direction</span>, the quarters above and below, he dwells pervading the whole world with a mind imbued with benevolence, free from enmity, unsurpassed, free from ill will, vast, all—pervasive, immeasurable, well-developed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><span class="supplied">He should then</span> reflect in this way: ‘Formerly, my mind was not developed, it was small, <span class="supplied">whereas</span> in this way now my mind has become immeasurable and well-developed.’ Monks, for the mind of a well-taught noble disciple <span class="supplied">which has been cultivated in this way</span> it is impossible to be negligent, <span class="supplied">the mind</span> does not fall <span class="supplied">into negligence</span>, it does not abide <span class="supplied">in negligence</span>, and becomes beyond measurement.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a>Monks, suppose there is a small boy or a small girl who has <span class="supplied">since birth</span> developed the concentration of the mind of benevolence. Would <span class="supplied">later he or she</span> change into doing actions of body, speech and mind that are evil and unwholesome actions? Or would <span class="supplied">he or she</span> similarly display for a long time actions that are contrary to the Dharma, unbeneficial and <span class="supplied">result in</span> <i lang="sa">duḥkha</i> for others?” “It is not so, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a>“Monks, it is well, it is well. Monks, a man or a woman, whether being a householder or one gone forth, should develop the concentration of the mind of benevolence. Why is that, monks? A man or woman, whether being a householder or one gone forth, once <span class="supplied">he or she</span> has abandoned this body and will be going to the other world,<a class="tu"></a><a class="t" id="ttu_272b"></a> monks, <span class="supplied">he or she</span> will enter <span class="supplied">the next birth</span> based on a mind which is determined by the mind that depends on the mental quality that conforms to <span class="supplied">that particular</span> mental state.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="22"></a>Monks, one says: ‘With this body of mine formerly I did evil, unwholesome actions, which have been accumulated. With regard to all that has become accumulated, let it be experienced <span class="supplied">now</span> and not be experienced further at the time of birth.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="23"></a>Monks, if at the present time one is <span class="supplied">thus</span> endowed with the concentration of the mind of benevolence, one will directly know the state of non-retrogression or the highest Dharma. Therefore a Monks, one says: ‘With this body of mine formerly I did evil, unwholesome actions, which have been accumulated. With regard to all that has become accumulated, let it be experienced <span class="supplied">now</span> and not be experienced further at the time of birth.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="24"></a>Monks, if at the present time one is <span class="supplied">thus</span> endowed with the concentration of the mind of benevolence, one will directly know the state of non-retrogression or the highest Dharma. Therefore a well-taught noble disciple has abandoned evil and unwholesome bodily <span class="supplied">actions</span> and develops wholesome bodily actions, has abandoned evil and unwholesome verbal and mental <span class="supplied">actions</span> and develops wholesome verbal and mental actions.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="25"></a>By <span class="supplied">developing</span> in sequence one after the other that which is called a ‘mind imbued with compassion, <span class="supplied">a mind imbued with</span> sympathetic joy and <span class="supplied">a mind imbued with</span> equanimity’, monks, one who having done so is endowed with the concentration of the mind of equanimity, will directly know the state of non—retrogression or the highest Dharma.”</p>
