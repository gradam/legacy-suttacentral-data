<p>The narrative introduction is Sāvatthī.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="supplied">At that time the Blessed One said to the monks:</span> “Monks, bodily form is impermanent. What is impermanent, that is <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>. What is <i lang="pi">dukkha</i>, that is not-self. What is not-self should be seen with right wisdom as ‘this is not me, this cannot be grasped as mine, this cannot be grasped as my own self.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Monks, a learned noble disciple who contemplate in this way will become disenchanted with bodily form and will likewise become disenchanted with feeling, perception, formations and consciousness. One who has become disenchanted, will be free from desire. When he is free from desire, he will be liberated. When he is liberated, knowledge and vision of liberation <span class="supplied">arise, namely that</span> ‘Birth for me has been exhausted. The holy life has been fulfilled. What had to be done has been done. Existence other than the present one shall not be known <span class="supplied">by me</span>’.” Thus it was said.</p>
