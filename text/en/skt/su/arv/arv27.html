<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This was said by the Gracious One:</p>
<p>“I will teach the Dharma to you, monastics, those Dharma teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end, with their meaning, with their <span class="add">(proper)</span> phrasing, I will make known the spiritual life which is complete, fulfilled, accomplished, that is to say, the Dharma instruction known as the Analysis of the Topics.”</p>
<p>When this was said, he said this also: “There are for you, monastics, wildernesses, roots of trees, empty places, mountain caves and caverns, heaps of straw, open spaces, cemeteries, deep and remote forests, you can live in these dwelling places. Meditate, monastics, do not be heedless, do not regret it later.” </p>
<p>This is the advice. </p>
<p>And while this Dharma instruction was being spoken the minds of five hundred monastics were freed from the attachments and the pollutants. </p>
<p>The Gracious One said this,</p>
<p>and those monastics and the whole assembly were uplifted, together with the gods, humans, demons and angels in the world, and they greatly rejoiced in what was said by the Gracious One. </p>
<p class="endsutta">The Dharma instruction known as the Analysis of the Topics is Complete</p>
