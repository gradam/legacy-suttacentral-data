<h1>11. The Four Ways of Practice</h1>
</div>
<p>Herein, <span class="add">monastics,</span> what are the four ways of practice?</p>
<ol><li>There is, monastics, practice which is painful and slow in knowledge, </li>
<li>practice which is painful and quick in knowledge, </li>
<li>practice which is pleasant and slow in knowledge, </li>
<li>practice which is pleasant and quick in knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<h2><span class="add">11.1 Painful and Slow in Knowledge</span></h2>
<p>Herein, what is the practice which is painful and slow in knowledge?</p>
<p>Here, one person constitutionally has great passion, has great hatred, has great delusion, and because of his great passion, he continually experiences pain and sorrow which is born of passion, and because of his great hatred, he continually experiences pain and sorrow which is born of hatred, and because of his great delusion, he continually experiences pain and sorrow which is born of delusion.</p>
<p>And for him these five supermundane faculties are slow, feeble, not sharp, not speedy in bringing about the destruction of the pollutants. </p>
<p>What five?</p>
<p>They are as follows: </p>
<ol><li>The faith faculty,</li>
<li> the energy faculty,</li>
<li> the mindfulness faculty,</li>
<li> the concentration faculty,</li>
<li> the wisdom faculty.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus these five supermundane faculties are feeble and not speedy and are slow in bringing about contact with the meditation that has immediate result, that is to say, the destruction of the pollutants. </p>
<p>This is the practice which is painful and slow in knowledge.</p>
<h2><span class="add">11.2 Painful and Quick in Knowledge</span></h2>
<p>Herein, what is the practice which is painful and quick in knowledge?</p>
<p>Here, one person constitutionally has great passion, has great hatred, has great delusion, and because of his great passion, he continually experiences pain and sorrow which is born of passion, and because of his great hatred, he continually experiences pain and sorrow which is born of hatred, and because of his great delusion, he continually experiences pain and sorrow which is born of delusion.</p>
<p><span class="add">(But)</span> for him these five supermundane faculties are in high measure, <span class="add">(they are)</span> sharp and speedy in bringing about <span class="add">the destruction of the pollutants</span>.</p>
<p>What five?</p>
<p>They are as follows:</p>
<ol><li>The faith faculty,</li>
<li> the energy faculty,</li>
<li> the mindfulness faculty,</li>
<li> the concentration faculty,</li>
<li> the wisdom faculty.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="add">(Therefore)</span> these five supermundane faculties being in high measure, they are <span class="add">(sharp)</span> and speedy and quick in bringing about contact with the meditation that has immediate result, that is to say, the destruction of the pollutants.</p>
<p>This is the practice which is painful and quick in knowledge.</p>
<h2><span class="add">11.3 Pleasant and Slow in Knowledge</span></h2>
<p>Herein, what is the practice which is pleasant and slow in knowledge?</p>
<p>Here, one person constitutionally has little passion, has little hatred, has little delusion, and because of his little passion, he does not continually experience pain and sorrow which is born of passion, and because of his little hatred, he does not continually experience pain and sorrow which is born of hatred, and because of his little delusion, he does not continually experience pain and sorrow which is born of delusion.</p>
<p><span class="add">(But)</span> for him these five supermundane faculties are slow, feeble, not sharp, not speedy in bringing about <span class="add">the destruction of the pollutants</span>.</p>
<p>What five?</p>
<p>They are as follows:</p>
<ol><li>The faith faculty,</li>
<li> the energy faculty,</li>
<li> the mindfulness faculty,</li>
<li> the concentration faculty,</li>
<li> the wisdom faculty.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="add">(Therefore)</span> these five supermundane faculties are slow, not sharp, feeble, not speedy and are slow in bringing about contact with the meditation that has immediate result, that is to say, the destruction of the pollutants.</p>
<p>This is the practice which is pleasant and slow in knowledge.</p>
<h2><span class="add">11.4 Pleasant and Quick in Knowledge</span></h2>
<p>Herein, what is the practice which is pleasant and quick in knowledge?</p>
<p>Here, one person constitutionally has little passion, has little hatred, has little delusion, and because of his little passion, he does not continually experience pain and sorrow which is born of passion, and because of his little hatred, he does not continually experience pain and sorrow which is born of hatred, and because of his little delusion, he does not continually experience pain and sorrow which is born of delusion.</p>
<p><span class="add">(But)</span> for him these five supermundane faculties are in high measure, <span class="add">(they are)</span> sharp and speedy in bringing about <span class="add">the destruction of the pollutants</span>.</p>
<p>What five?</p>
<p>They are as follows:</p>
<ol><li>The faith faculty,</li>
<li> the energy faculty,</li>
<li> the mindfulness faculty,</li>
<li> the concentration faculty,</li>
<li> the wisdom faculty.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="add">(Therefore)</span> these five supermundane faculties, being in high measure, they are <span class="add">(sharp)</span> and speedy and quick in bringing about contact with the meditation that has immediate result, that is to say, the destruction of the pollutants.</p>
<p>This is said to be the practice which is pleasant and quick in knowledge.</p>
<p>These, monastics, are the four ways of practice.</p>
