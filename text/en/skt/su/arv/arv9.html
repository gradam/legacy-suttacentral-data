<h1>9. The Four Formless Attainments</h1>
</div>
<p>Herein, monastics, what are the four formless attainments?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Here, monastics, a monastic, having completely transcended perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of <span class="add">(sensory)</span> impact, not attending to perceptions of variety, <span class="add">(understanding)</span>: ‘This is endless space’, abides in the sphere of endless space.</p></li>
<li><p>Having completely transcended the sphere of endless space, <span class="add">(understanding)</span>: ‘This is endless consciousness,’ he abides in the sphere of endless consciousness.</p></li>
<li><p>Having completely transcended the sphere of endless consciousness, <span class="add">(understanding)</span>: ‘This is nothing,’ he abides in the sphere of nothingness.</p></li>
<li><p>Having completely transcended the sphere of nothingness, he abides in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These, monastics, are said to be the four formless attainments. </p>
