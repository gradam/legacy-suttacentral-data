<h1>8. The Four Absorptions</h1>
</div>
<p>Herein, monastics, what are the four absorptions?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Here, monastics, a monastic, quite secluded from sense desires, secluded from wicked and unwholesome things, having thinking, reflection, and the happiness and rapture born of seclusion, dwells having attained the first absorption.</p></li>
<li><p>With the stilling of thinking and reflection, with internal clarity, and one-pointedness of mind, being without thinking, without reflection, having the happiness and rapture born of concentration, he dwells having attained the second absorption.</p></li>
<li><p>With the fading away of rapture he dwells equanimous, mindful, clearly knowing, experiencing happiness through the body, about which the Noble Ones declare: He lives pleasantly, mindful, and equanimous, <span class="add">(thus)</span> he dwells having attained the third absorption.</p></li>
<li><p>Having given up pleasure and given up pain, and with the previous disappearance of mental well-being and sorrow, without pain, without pleasure, and with complete purity of mindfulness and equanimity, he dwells having attained the fourth absorption.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These, monastics, are the four absorptions. </p>
