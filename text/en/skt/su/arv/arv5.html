</div>
<p>Herein, monastics, what are the twelve factors of conditional origination? </p>
<p>It is as follows:</p>
<p>This being so, that is; from the arising of this, that arises.</p>
<p>They are <span class="add">(also)</span> as follows:</p>
<ol><li>With ignorance as condition: volitions,</li>
<li>with volitions as condition: consciousness,</li>
<li>with consciousness as condition: mind and body,</li>
<li>with mind and body as condition: the six sense-spheres,</li>
<li>with the six sense-spheres as condition: contact,</li>
<li>with contact as condition: feeling,</li>
<li>with feeling as condition: craving,</li>
<li>with craving as condition: attachment,</li>
<li>with attachment as condition: continuation,</li>
<li>with continuation as condition: birth,</li>
<li>with birth as condition:</li>
<li>old age, death, grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and despair <span class="add">(all)</span> arise, and so there is an origination of this whole great mass of suffering.</li>
</ol>
<ol><li><span class="add">(But)</span> from the cessation of ignorance, there is the cessation of volitions,</li>
<li>from the cessation of volitions, the cessation of consciousness,</li>
<li>from the cessation of consciousness, the cessation of mind and body,</li>
<li>from the cessation of mind and body, the cessation of the six sense-spheres,</li>

<li>from the cessation of attachment, the cessation of continuation,</li>
<li>from the cessation of continuation, the cessation of birth,</li>
<li>from the cessation of birth:</li>
<li>old age, death, grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and despair <span class="add">(all)</span> cease, and so there is a cessation of this whole great mass of suffering.</li>
</ol>
