<h1>16. The Five Faculties</h1>
</div>
<p>Herein, monastics, what are the five faculties?</p>
<p>They are as follows:</p>
<ol><li>The faculty of faith, </li>
<li>the faculty of energy, </li>
<li>the faculty of mindfulness, </li>
<li>the faculty of concentration, </li>
<li>the faculty of wisdom.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p>Herein, what is the faculty of faith?</p>
<p>It is the faith he has regarding four things. </p>
<p>Which four? </p>
<ol><li>He has faith in the right view concerning the worldly realms of birth and death, </li>
<li> in refuge in deeds and results, </li>
<li> in all the deeds that I will do, whether good or bad, I will experience the result of that deed, </li>
<li> in he will not do bad deeds, even for the sake of life. </li>
</ol>
<p>This is said to be faith. </p></li>
<li><p>Herein, what is the faculty of energy?</p>
<p>With the faculty of faith he has faith in those things, and with the faculty of energy he makes those things arise. </p>
<p>This is said to be energy. </p></li>
<li><p>Herein, what is the faculty of mindfulness?</p>
<p>With the faculty of energy he makes those things arise, and with the faculty of mindfulness he makes those things not go to destruction. </p>
<p>This is said to be mindfulness. </p></li>
<li><p>Herein, what is the faculty of concentration?</p>
<p>With the faculty of mindfulness he makes those things not go to destruction, and with the faculty of concentration he fixes his attention on those things. </p>
<p>This is said to be concentration. </p></li>
<li><p>Herein, what is the faculty of wisdom?</p>
<p>With the faculty of concentration he fixes his attention on those things, and with the faculty of wisdom he penetrates and reflects on the birth of those things.</p>
<p>This is said to be wisdom. </p></li>
</ol>
<p>These, monastics, are the five faculties. </p>
