</div>
<p>Herein, monastics, what are the four bases of spiritual power?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Herein, monastics, a monastic cultivates the basis of spiritual power that is concentration of desire accompanied by the volition of striving, depending on solitude, depending on dispassion, depending on cessation, maturing in relinquishment, and his desire will not be too slack, nor too grasping. </p></li>
<li><p>He cultivates the basis of spiritual power that is concentration of energy accompanied by the volition of striving, depending on solitude, depending on dispassion, depending on cessation, maturing in relinquishment, and his energy will not be too slack, nor too grasping. </p></li>
<li><p>He cultivates the basis of spiritual power that is concentration of thought accompanied by the volition of striving, depending on solitude, depending on dispassion, depending on cessation, maturing in relinquishment, and his thought will not be too slack, nor too grasping. </p></li>
<li><p>He cultivates the basis of spiritual power that is concentration of investigation accompanied by the volition of striving, depending on solitude, depending on dispassion, depending on cessation, maturing in relinquishment, and his investigation will not be too slack, nor too grasping. </p></li>
</ol>
<p>These, monastics, are the four bases of spiritual power.</p>
