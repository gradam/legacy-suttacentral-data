<h1>The Discourse on the Amount of Savings</h1>
</hgroup><blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>A man stores his savings<br>
in a deep pit close to water <span class="supplied">thinking</span>:<br>
“When a duty or need has arisen<br>
it will be there to help me,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>to free me from a king if slandered, or from molestation<br>
from a thief, or from a debt, or famine, or accident.”<br>
For this kind of help, savings are stored up in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>Although it is well stored<br>
in a deep pit, close to water,<br>
still, it cannot help him in all things on every occasion,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>for perhaps those savings are removed from that place,<br>
or he forgets the signs <span class="supplied">telling where they lie</span>,<br>
or nāgas take them away,<br>
or yakkhas carry them off,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>or the heirs he dislikes<br>
extract them unseen,<br>
and when his merit comes to an end<br>
all of it will be destroyed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>But that woman or man who through giving, virtue,<br>
restraint, and self-control has well stored up his savings, <br><span class="supplied">placing them</span> in a shrine, or in the Sangha,<br>
or in an individual, or a guest,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>or in his mother or father,<br>
also in an elder brother,<br>
those savings are well stored up,<br>
they follow one, they do not decay.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><span class="supplied">Riches</span> he gives up when he has to leave <span class="supplied">this life</span><br>
but this goes along <span class="supplied">with him</span>.<br>
It is not shared with others,<br>
no thief carries those savings away,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>the wise man should make merit, <br><span class="supplied">for</span> those savings follow one along.<br>
These savings satisfy every desire of gods and men,<br>
whatever they wish for,<br>
through this <span class="supplied">merit</span> they receive all.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>A good appearance, a good voice,<br>
a good shape, a good form,<br>
sovereignty, and a retinue,<br>
through this <span class="supplied">merit</span> they receive all.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>A local kingship, an empire,<br>
and whatever happiness a Wheel-Rolling <span class="supplied">King</span> has,<br>
also godly kingship in the heavens,<br>
through this <span class="supplied">merit</span> they receive all.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>Human good fortune,<br>
delight in the world of the gods,<br>
even the attainment of Emancipation,<br>
through this <span class="supplied">merit</span> they receive all.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>With the attainment of <span class="supplied">good</span> friends,<br>
devotion to systematic <span class="supplied">thought</span>,<br>
there is the power of understanding and freedom,<br>
through this <span class="supplied">merit</span> they receive all.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a>The discriminations, and the liberations,<br>
and whatever perfections the disciples have,<br>
Independent Awakening, the Buddhas’ ground,<br>
through this <span class="supplied">merit</span> they receive all.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a>So this is of great benefit,<br>
that is to say, the attainment of merit,<br>
therefore the wise and intelligent <span class="supplied">always</span> praise the making of merit.</p>
