<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.9.1.1" href="#Bu-Ss.9.1.1"></a>
… at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding-place. At that time
as the monks who were the followers of Mettiya and Bhummaja were descending
from the slope of the Vulture’s Peak, they saw a he-goat copulating with a
nanny-goat; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.167" href="#Vin.3.167"></a>
seeing them they said: “Look here, your reverences, let us call this he-goat
Dabba, the Mallian, and this nanny-goat Mettiyā, the nun; thus we will express
it: ‘Formerly, your reverences, we spoke to Dabba, the Mallian, about what was
heard, but now we have ourselves seen him sinning with the nun Mettiyā.” These
gave that he-goat the name of Dabba, the Mallian, and called that nanny-goat
Mettiyā, the nun.</p>
<p>These told the monks: “Formerly, your reverences, we spoke to Dabba, the
Mallian, about what was heard, but now we ourselves have seen him sinning with
Mettiyā, the nun.”</p>
<p>The monks said: “Your reverences, do not speak like that; the venerable Dabba,
the Mallian, would not do that.”</p>
<p>Then these monks told this matter to the lord. The lord, on that occasion, in
that connection, having had the Order of monks convened, asked the venerable
Dabba, the Mallian:</p>
<p>“Do you remember, Dabba, to have done as these monks say?”</p>
<p>“Lord, the lord knows with regard to me,” he said.</p>
<p>A second time, the lord … a third time the lord said to the venerable Dabba,
the Mallian … “knows with regard to me,” he said.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.289" href="#BD.1.289"></a>
“Do not, Dabba, …” … “… how much more when I was awake.” he said.</p>
<p>Then the lord addressed the monks: “Because of this, monks, you should put
questions to these monks.” Having spoken thus, the lord rising up from his
seat, entered the <i lang="pi">vihāra</i>.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.9.1.2" href="#Bu-Ss.9.1.2"></a>
Then these monks put questions to the monks who were followers of Mettiya and
Bhummajaka. These, being questioned by the monks, told this matter to the
monks.</p>
<p>“Did you not defame the venerable Dabba, the Mallian, your reverences, with a
charge of falling into defeat, taking up some point as a pretext in a legal
question really belonging to something else?”</p>
<p>“It is so, your reverences,” they said.</p>
<p>Then those who were modest monks became annoyed, vexed and angry, and said:
“How can the monks who are followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka defame the
venerable Dabba, the Mallian, with … to something else?”</p>
<p>Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said: “Is it true as is said,
that you, monks, defamed Dabba, the Mallian, with … to something else?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How can you, foolish men,
defame Dabba, the Mallian, with … to something else? Foolish men, it is not for
the benefit of unbelievers … And thus, monks, this course of training should be
set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, malignant, malicious and ill-tempered,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.168" href="#Vin.3.168"></a>
should defame a monk with a charge involving defeat, taking up some point as a
pretext in a legal question really belonging to something else, saying: ‘Thus
perhaps may I drive him away from <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.290" href="#BD.1.290"></a>
this Brahma-life’; then, if afterwards, he, being pressed or not being pressed,
the legal question turning out to belong to something different, if the monk
confesses his malice and (confesses) having taken up some point as a pretext:
it is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.” </span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.9.2.1" href="#Bu-Ss.9.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… <span class="add">= <a class="cr" href="#Bu-Ss.8.2">Bu-Ss.8.2</a></span> … is angry.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.9.2.2" href="#Bu-Ss.9.2.2"></a>
<span class="term">In a legal question really belonging to something else</span> means:
<span class="gloss">either it is an offence of a different kind or it is a legal question of a
different kind.</span></p>
<p>How is a legal question connected with a different kind of legal question? The
legal question arising out of disputes may belong to something different: to a
legal question arising out of censure, to a legal question arising out of
transgressions, to a legal question arising out of obligations. A legal
question arising out of censure … a legal question arising out of
transgressions … a legal question arising out of obligations may belong to
something different: to a legal question arising out of disputes, to a legal
question arising out of transgressions, to a legal question arising out of
obligations. Thus a legal question may belong to a different legal question.</p>
<p>How is a legal question connected with a legal question? A question arising out
of disputes is connected with a question arising out of disputes. A question
arising out of censure is connected with a question arising out of censure. A
question arising out of transgression may be connected with a question arising
out of transgression, or it may be connected with something else. How is a
question arising out of transgression connected with something other than a
question arising out of transgression? An offence involving defeat through
sexual intercourse may belong to something else: to an offence involving defeat
through taking something that was not given, to an offence involving <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.291" href="#BD.1.291"></a>
defeat through taking up human form, to an offence involving defeat through
claiming states of further-men. An offence involving defeat through taking
something that was not given … an offence involving defeat through taking up
human form … an offence involving defeat through claiming states of further-men
may belong to something else: to an offence involving defeat through sexual
intercourse, to an offence involving defeat through taking something that was
not given, to an offence involving defeat through taking up human form. Thus a
question arising out of transgression may belong to something other than a
question arising out of transgression. And how can a question arising out of
transgression belong to a question arising out of transgression? An offence
involving defeat through sexual intercourse may belong to an offence involving
defeat through sexual intercourse … an offence involving defeat through
claiming states of further-men may belong to an offence involving defeat
through claiming states of further-men. Thus does a question arising out of
transgression belong to a question arising out of transgression. A question
arising out of obligations may belong to a question arising out of obligations.
Thus may a legal question belong to a legal question.</p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.9.3.1" href="#Bu-Ss.9.3.1"></a>
A monk is seen committing an offence which entails a formal meeting of the
Order; in the offence which entails a formal meeting of the Order there is a
wrong view as to an offence which entails a formal meeting of the Order. If he
reprimands him for a matter involving defeat, saying: “You are not a (true)
recluse … nor a ceremony performed by a chapter of monks,” thus it is connected
with a different kind of offence and a pretext is taken up: for each speech
there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.</p>
<p>A monk is seen committing an offence which entails a formal meeting of the
Order; in the offence which <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.294" href="#BD.1.294"></a>
entails a formal meeting of the Order there is the wrong view that it is a
grave offence … there is the wrong view that it is an offence requiring
expiation … there is the wrong view that it is an offence which ought to be
confessed … there is the wrong view that it is an offence of wrong-doing …
there is the wrong view that it is an offence of evil speech. If he reprimands
him … for each speech there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the
Order.</p>
<p>A monk is seen committing a grave offence … an offence requiring expiation … an
offence which ought to be confessed … an offence of wrong-doing … an offence of
evil speech; in the evil speech there is a wrong view of evil speech. If he
reprimands him … for each speech there is an offence entailing a formal meeting
of the Order.</p>
<p>A monk is seen committing an offence of evil speech; there is the wrong view
that in the offence of evil speech there is an offence entailing a formal
meeting of the Order; there is the wrong view that in the evil speech there is
a grave offence, an offence requiring expiation, an offence which ought to be
confessed, an offence of wrong-doing. If he reprimands him … for each speech
there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.</p>
<p class="end">Beginning severally, the series, with this exception, should be put together.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.9.3.2" href="#Bu-Ss.9.3.2"></a>
A monk is seen committing an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order;
in the offence which entails a formal meeting of the Order there is a wrong
view as to an offence which entails a formal meeting of the Order. If he causes
him to be reprimanded for an offence involving defeat, saying: “You are not a
(true) recluse … for each speech there is an offence entailing a formal meeting
of the Order.</p>
<p>A monk is seen committing an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order;
in the offence which entails a formal meeting of the Order there is a wrong

that it is a grave offence … a wrong view that it is an offence of evil speech

There is no offence if, thinking what is true, he reprimands him or causes him
to be reprimanded, if he is out of his mind, if he is a beginner.</p>
