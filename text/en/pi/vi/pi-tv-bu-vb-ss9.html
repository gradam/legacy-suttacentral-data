<h1>Monks’ Suspension 9: Anger (2nd rule)</h1>
</div>
<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.288">BD.1.288</a><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Ss.9.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.9.1.1">Bu-Ss.9.1.1</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1626"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. At that time, while they were descending from Mount Vulture Peak, some monks who were followers of Mettiya and Bhummaja saw two goats copulating. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.167">Vin.3.167</a>They said to each other: “Let’s give the he-goat the name Dabba the Mallian and the she-goat the name Mettiya the nun. We can then say: ‘Formerly we spoke based on what we had heard about Dabba the Mallian, but now we have seen him ourselves copulating with the nun Mettiya.’” They then gave them those names and informed the monks: “Earlier we spoke about what we had heard, but now we have seen Dabba the Mallian copulating with the nun Mettiya.”</p>
<p>The monks replied: “Don’t say such things. Venerable Dabba the Mallian wouldn’t do that.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1627"></a>The monks informed the Master. The Master convened the Sangha and asked Venerable Dabba the Mallian: “Dabba, do you remember doing as these monks say?”</p>
<p>“Bhante, the Master knows about me.”</p>
<p>A second and a third time the Master asked the same question and got the same response. He then said:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.289">BD.1.289</a>“Dabba, the Dabbas do not give such evasive answers. If it was done by you, say so; if it was not done by you, then say that.”</p>
<p>“Bhante, since I was born I do not recall having sexual intercourse even in a dream, much less when I was awake.”</p>
<p>“Well then, monks, call those monks to account,” and he rose from his seat and entered his dwelling.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.9.1.2">Bu-Ss.9.1.2</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1628"></a>The monks then questioned the monks who were followers of Mettiya and Bhummaja, who told them what had happened. The monks said: “Did you accuse Venerable Dabba the Mallian of an offence entailing expulsion, using an unrelated issue as a pretext?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The monks of few desires … complained and criticised them: “How can the monks who are followers of Mettiya and Bhummaja accuse Venerable Dabba in this way?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1629"></a>They rebuked those monks in many ways and then informed the Master. He said: “Is it true, monks, that you accused Dabba the Mallian of an offence entailing expulsion, using an unrelated issue as a pretext?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked them: “… Foolish men, how could you accuse Dabba in this way? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2 class="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1630"></a>“If a monk who is angry and displeased, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.168">Vin.3.168</a>using an unrelated issue as a pretext, accuses another monk of an offence entailing expulsion, aiming to make him leave <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.290">BD.1.290</a>the monastic life, and then after some time, whether he is questioned or not, it is clear that the issue is unrelated and used as a pretext, and he admits his anger, he commits an offence entailing suspension.”</p>

<p>It is either unrelated in regard to offences or unrelated in regard to issues.</p>
<p>How is an issue unrelated to an issue? An issue due to a dispute is unrelated to an issue due to an accusation, an issue due to an offence, and an issue due to a proceeding. An issue due to an accusation is unrelated to an issue due to an offence, an issue due to a proceeding, and an issue due to a dispute. An issue due to an offence is unrelated to an issue due to a proceeding, an issue due to a dispute, and an issue due to an accusation. An issue due to a proceeding is unrelated to an issue due to a dispute, an issue due to an accusation, and an issue due to an offence. It is in this way that an issue is unrelated to an issue.</p>
