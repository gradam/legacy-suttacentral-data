… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks, staying with the army for two (or) three nights, went
to a sham-fight and to the troops in array and to the massing of the army and
to see a review. Then a certain monk of the group of six, having gone to a
sham-fight, became pierced by an arrow. People made fun of that monk, saying:</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, we hope it was a good battle. How many targets were obtained by
you?”</p>
<p>That monk, being made fun of by these people, became ashamed. People … spread
it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, come to see a sham-fight? For us
it is not profitable, and for us it is ill-gotten; such as we come to a
sham-fight for the sake of livelihood, on account of child and wife.”</p>
<p>Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this group of six monks go to see a sham-fight?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, went to see a sham-fight?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.380" href="#BD.2.380"></a>
“How can you, foolish men, go to see a sham-fight? It is not, foolish men, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of
training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">If a monk, staying with the army for two nights, three nights, should go to a
sham-fight or to the troops in array or to the massing of the army or to see a
review, then is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p>If he goes to see, there is an offence of wrong-doing. Standing where he sees,
there is an offence of expiation. If, having dismissed from sight, he sees
again, there is an offence of expiation. If he goes to see one or other, there
is an offence of wrong-doing. Standing where he sees, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If, having dismissed from sight, he sees again, there is an
offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.50.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.50.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if, standing in the monastery, he sees; if a conflict is
seen, having come to a place where a monk is resting or to a place where he is
sitting down or to a place where he is lying down; if he, going along <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.381" href="#BD.2.381"></a>
the opposite road, sees (it); if, going as there is something to be done, he
sees (it); if there are accidents; if he is mad, if he is the first
wrong-doer.</p>
