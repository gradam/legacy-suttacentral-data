At one time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in
Anāthapiṇḍika’s park in the Jeta Grove. At that time the venerable Udāyin was
dependent on families in Sāvatthī and approached many families. Now at that
time the young girl of a family who was supporting the venerable Udāyin had
been given (in marriage) to a boy of a certain family. Then the venerable
Udāyin, getting up early and taking his bowl and robe; approached that family,
and having approached them he asked the people:</p>
<p>“Where is (the girl) called so and so?” They said:</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, she was given to a boy of a certain family.” Now this family
supported the venerable Udāyin. Then the venerable Udāyin approached this
family, and having approached them he asked the people:</p>
<p>“Where is (the girl) called so and so?” They said:</p>
<p>“Master, she is sitting in the inner room.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Udāyin approached this girl, and having approached her, he
sat down together with that girl, a man and a woman, in a secret place on a
secluded, convenient seat, conversing at the right time, speaking <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> at the right time.</p>
<p>Now at that time Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, had many children and many
grandchildren. The children were <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.331" href="#BD.1.331"></a>
healthy and the grandchildren were healthy and she was considered to be
auspicious. People used to regale Visākhā first at sacrifices, festivals and
feasts. So Visākhā, being invited, went to that family. Visākhā saw the
venerable Udāyin sitting together with that girl, a man and a woman, in a
secret place on a secluded, convenient seat. Seeing this, she said to the
venerable Udāyin:</p>
<p>“This is not proper, honoured sir, it is not suitable that the master should
sit together with women-folk, a man and a woman, in a secret place on a
secluded, convenient seat. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.188" href="#Vin.3.188"></a>
Although, honoured sir, the master has no desire for that thing, unbelieving
people are difficult to convince.”</p>
<p>But the venerable Udāyin took no heed after he had been spoken to thus by
Visākhā. Then Visākhā, when she had departed, told this matter to the monks.
Those who were modest monks became annoyed, vexed, angry and said:</p>
<p>“How can the venerable Udāyin sit together with womenfolk, a man and a woman,
in a secret place on a secluded, convenient seat?” And these monks told this
matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, Udāyin, that you sat together with womenfolk, a man
and a woman, in a secret place on a secluded, convenient seat?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying: “How can you, foolish man,
sit together with womenfolk, a man with a woman, in a secret place on a
secluded, convenient seat? It is not, foolish man, for the benefit of
unbelievers … And thus, monks, this course of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should sit down together with a <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.332" href="#BD.1.332"></a>
woman, the one with the other, in a secret place on a secluded, convenient
seat, and if a trustworthy woman lay-follower seeing him should speak
concerning a certain one of three matters: either one involving defeat, or one
entailing a formal meeting of the Order, or one involving expiation, and the
monk himself acknowledging that he was sitting down, should be dealt with
according to a certain one of three matters: as to whether it is one involving
defeat, or as to whether it is one entailing a formal meeting of the Order, or
as to whether it is one involving expiation. Or that monk should be dealt with
according to what that trustworthy woman lay-follower should say. This is an
undetermined matter.”</span></p>
