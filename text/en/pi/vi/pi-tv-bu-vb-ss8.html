<h1>Monks’ Suspension 8: Anger (1st rule)</h1>
</div>
<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.271"></a><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Ss.8.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.8.1.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.158"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1556"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. At that time Venerable Dabba the Mallian had realised arahantship when he was seven years old. He had realised all there is to be realised by a disciple, and he had nothing further to do. Then, while he was in seclusion, he reflected on this and thought, “How might I be of service to the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.272"></a>Sangha? <a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1557"></a>Perhaps I could assign the lodgings for the Sangha and designate the meals?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.8.1.2"></a>In the evening Venerable Dabba the Mallian came out of seclusion and approached the Master. He paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: “Bhante, while I was in seclusion I reflected that I have attained all that can be attained by a disciple, and I was wondering how I might be of service to the Sangha. Bhante, I wish to assign lodgings for the Sangha and designate the meals.”</p>
<p>“Well then, Dabba, please do so.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.8.1.3"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1558"></a>Then the Master spoke on the Dhamma and addressed the monks: “Monks, let the Sangha elect Dabba the Mallian as the assigner of lodgings and the designator of meals. And this is how he should be elected. First Dabba should be asked, and then an experienced and competent monk should inform the Sangha:</p>
<div class="kamma">
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1559"></a>‘Bhante, let the Sangha listen to me. If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should elect Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of lodgings and as designator of meals. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.159"></a>This is the motion.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1560"></a>‘Bhante, let the Sangha listen to me. The Sangha elects Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of lodgings and as designator of meals. Any monk who agrees to electing Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of lodgings and as designator of meals should remain silent. Any monk who does not agree should say so.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1561"></a>‘The Sangha has elected Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of lodgings and as designator of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.273"></a>meals. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”</p>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.8.1.4"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1562"></a>Then Venerable Dabba assigned lodgings to the monks according to their character. He assigned lodgings in the same place to those monks who were <i>sutta</i> experts, thinking, “They will recite the <i>suttas</i> to each other.” Likewise for the Vinaya experts, thinking, “They will investigate the Vinaya;” for the Dhamma teachers, thinking, “They will have a Dhamma discussion;” for he meditators, thinking, “They will not disturb each other;” for the gossips and the body builders, thinking, “In this way even these venerables will be happy.”</p>
<p>When monks arrived at night, he would enter the fire element and assign lodgings with the help of that <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.274"></a>light. Monks would even arrive late on purpose, hoping to see the marvel of psychic power of Venerable Dabba the Mallian.<a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1563"></a> They would approach Venerable Dabba and say: “Venerable Dabba, assign us a lodging.”</p>
<p>“Where would you like to stay?”</p>
<p>They would intentionally suggest somewhere far away: “Please give us a lodging on Mount Vulture Peak, or at Robbers’ Cliff, or on Black Rock on the slope of Mount Isigili, or in the Sattapaṇṇi Cave on the slope of Mount Vebhāra, or in Cool Grove on the hill at the Snake’s Pool, or at Gomaṭa Gorge, or at Tinduka Gorge, or at Tapoda Gorge, or in Tapoda Park, or <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.160"></a>in Jīvaka’s Mango Grove, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.275"></a>or in the deer park at Maddakucchi.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1564"></a>Venerable Dabba the Mallian entered the fire element, and with his finger glowing, he walked in front of those monks. They followed closely behind him with the help of that light. He would then assign them lodgings: “This is the bed, this the bench, this the cushion, this the pillow, this the toilet, this the urinal, this the drinking water, this the water for other uses, this the walking stick, these are the Sangha’s agreements, this the time to enter, this the time to depart.” Then Venerable Dabba the Mallian returned to the Bamboo Grove.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.8.1.5"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1565"></a>At that time some monks who were followers of Mettiya and Bhummaja were newly ordained. They had little merit: they obtained inferior lodgings and meals. The people of Rājagaha wished to give specially prepared almsfood to the senior monks—ghee, oil, and special foods—but to the monks who were the<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.276"></a> followers of Mettiya and Bhummaja they gave ordinary food, broken rice accompanied by porridge. After the meal, when they had returned from almsround, they asked the senior monks: “What did you get at the refectory?”</p>
<p>Some said, “We got ghee, oil, and special foods.”</p>
<p>But the monks who were followers of Mettiya and Bhummaja said, “We didn’t get anything, except ordinary food of broken rice and porridge.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.8.1.6"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1566"></a>At that time a householder who offered nice food gave a regular meal to four monks. He made his offering in the refectory together with his wife and children. Some of them offered rice, others curries, others oil, and others special foods. On one occasion the meal to be given by this householder on the following day had been designated to some of the followers of Mettiya and Bhummaja. Just then that householder went to the monastery on some business. He approached Venerable Dabba the Mallian, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.161"></a>Venerable Dabba then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a Dhamma talk. After the talk, he asked Venerable Dabba, “Bhante, to whom is tomorrow’s meal in our house designated?”</p>
<p>“To the monks who are followers of Mettiya and Bhummaja.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.277"></a>The householder was disappointed, and he thought, “Why should bad monks eat in our house?” After returning to his house, he told a female slave: “For those who are coming for tomorrow’s meal, prepare seats on the porch and serve them broken rice and porridge.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.8.1.7"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1567"></a>The monks who were followers of Mettiya and Bhummaja said to one another: “Yesterday we were designated a meal from the householder who offers nice food, and tomorrow he will serve us together with his wife and children. Some of them will offer us rice, others curry, others oil, and others special foods.” And because they were excited, they did not sleep properly that night.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1568"></a>Then, after dressing in the morning, those monks took their bowl and robe, and went to the house of that householder. When the female slave saw them coming, she prepared seats on the porch and said to them: “Please sit, bhantes.”</p>
<p>The monks thought: “The meal <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.278"></a>must not be ready, since we are given seats on the porch.”</p>
<p>She then brought them broken rice accompanied by porridge and said: “Eat, bhantes.”</p>
<p>“But, sister, we have come for the regular meal.”</p>
<p>“I know. But yesterday I was told by the householder to serve you in this way. Please eat.”</p>
<p>Then those monks said to each other: “Yesterday this householder came to the monastery and spoke with Dabba the Mallian. Dabba must be responsible for this split between us and this householder.” And because they were dejected, they did not eat as much as they would have liked. After <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.162"></a> the meal, they returned to the monastery, put their bowls and robes away, and sat on their haunches outside the monastery entrance, supported by their outer robe. They were silent and dismayed, their shoulders drooping and their heads down, glum and speechless.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.8.1.8"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.279"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1569"></a>Just then the nun Mettiyā approached them and said: “I pay homage to you, sirs.” But they did not respond. A second time and a third time she said the same thing, but they still did not respond.</p>
<p>“Have I done something wrong? Why don’t you respond?”</p>
<p>“It’s because we’ve been badly treated by Dabba the Mallian, and you’re not taking an interest.”</p>
<p>“What can I do?”</p>
<p>“If you would like, you could make the Master expel Dabba the Mallian.”</p>
<p>“What should I do? How am I able to do that?”</p>
<p>“Go to the Master and say, ‘Bhante, this is not proper or appropriate. There is fear, distress, and oppression in this district, where none of these should exist. From where one would expect security, there is insecurity. It is as if water is burning. Venerable Dabba the Mallian has raped me.’”</p>
<p>“Very well, sirs,” and she approached the Master, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. She then repeated what she had been told to say.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.8.1.9"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.280"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1570"></a>The Master then convened the Sangha and asked Venerable Dabba the Mallian: “Dabba, do you remember doing as the nun Mettiyā says?”</p>
<p>“Bhante, the Master knows about me.”</p>
<p>A second and a third time the Master asked the same question and got the same response. He then said: “Dabba, the Dabbas do not give such evasive answers. If it was done by you, say so; if it was not done by you, then say that.”</p>
<p>“Bhante, since I was born I do not recall having sexual intercourse even in a dream, much less when I was awake.”</p>
<p>Then the Master addressed the monks: “Well then, monks, expel the nun Mettiyā,<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.163"></a> and call these monks to account.” The Master then rose from his seat and entered his dwelling.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1571"></a>When the monks had expelled the nun Mettiyā, the monks who were followers of Mettiya and Bhummaja said to them: “Do not expel the nun Mettiyā; she has done nothing wrong. She was urged on by us, because we were angry, displeased, and aiming to make Dabba leave the monastic life.”</p>
<p>“But did you groundlessly accuse Venerable Dabba the Mallian of an offence entailing expulsion?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The monks of few desires … complained and criticised them: “How can the monks who<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.281"></a> are followers of Mettiya and Bhummaja groundlessly accuse Venerable Dabba of an offence entailing expulsion?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1572"></a>They rebuked those monks in many ways and then informed the Master. He said: “Is it true, monks, that you groundlessly accused Dabba the Mallian of an offence entailing expulsion?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked them: “… Foolish men, how could you groundlessly accuse Dabba the Mallian of an offence entailing expulsion? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2 class="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1573"></a>“If a monk who is angry and displeased groundlessly accuses another monk of an offence entailing expulsion, aiming to make him leave the monastic life, and then after some time, whether he is questioned or not, it is clear that the issue is groundless, and he admits his anger, he commits an offence entailing suspension.”</p>
