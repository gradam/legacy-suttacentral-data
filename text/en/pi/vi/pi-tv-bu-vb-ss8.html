<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.158" href="#Vin.3.158"></a>
At one time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Rājagaha in the
Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding place. At that time perfection had been
attained by the venerable Dabba, the Mallian, seven years after his birth. All
that there is to be attained by a disciple had been fully attained by him; for
him there was nothing further to be done, no increase to (be added to) that
which had been done. Then the venerable Dabba, the Mallian, as he was
meditating alone and in solitude, thought: “Perfection was realised by me seven
years after my birth. Whatever there is to be attained by a disciple, all this
has been fully attained by me; for me there is nothing further to be done, no
increase (to be added) to that which has been done. What now if I should render
a service to the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.272" href="#BD.1.272"></a>
Order?” Then the venerable Dabba, the Mallian, thought: “What now if I should
assign lodgings to the Order, and should distribute the meals?”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.8.1.2" href="#Bu-Ss.8.1.2"></a>
Then the venerable, Dabba, the Mallian, rising up from his meditation at
evening time, approached the lord, and having approached him and greeted him,
he sat down to one side. As he was sitting to one side, the venerable Dabba,
the Mallian, said to the lord: “Now, lord, as I was meditating alone and in
solitude, I thought: ‘… What now if I were to render a service to the Order?’ I
thought of this, lord: ‘What now if I were to assign lodgings to the Order?
What if I should distribute the meals?’”</p>
<p>“It is good, it is good, Dabba; then, you, Dabba, assign the lodgings to the
Order and distribute the meals.”</p>
<p>“Very well, lord,” the reverend Dabba, the Mallian, answered the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.8.1.3" href="#Bu-Ss.8.1.3"></a>
Then the lord on this occasion, in this connection, having given <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk, addressed the monks: “Monks, let the Order consent that Dabba, the
Mallian, should assign the lodgings, and should distribute the meals. Monks,
this should be authorised thus: Dabba should first be asked and having been
asked, the Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, let the Order hear me. If it is the right time for the Order,
let the Order consent that the venerable Dabba, the Mallian, should assign the
lodgings and distribute the meals. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.159" href="#Vin.3.159"></a>
That is the motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order hear me. The Order agrees that
the venerable Dabba, the Mallian, should assign the lodgings and distribute the
meals. If it pleases the venerable ones and there is permission that the
venerable Dabba, the Mallian, should assign lodgings and distribute the meals,
then be silent; if it does not seem good, then you should speak. It is agreed
by the Order that the venerable Dabba, the Mallian, should assign the lodgings
and distribute the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.273" href="#BD.1.273"></a>
meals. It is agreed … Thus do I understand.’</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.8.1.4" href="#Bu-Ss.8.1.4"></a>
Then the venerable Dabba, the Mallian, being so chosen, assigned one lodging in
the same place for those monks who belonged to the same company. For those
monks who knew the Suttantas he assigned a lodging in the same place, saying:
“These will be able to chant over the Suttantas to one another.” For those
monks versed in the Vinaya rules, he assigned a lodging in the same place,
saying: “They will decide upon the Vinaya with one another.” For those monks
teaching <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> he assigned a lodging in the same place, saying: “They will discuss <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> with one another.” For those monks who were musers he assigned a lodging in
the same place, saying: “They will not disturb one another.” For those monks
who lived indulging in low talk and who were athletic he assigned a lodging in
the same place, saying: “These reverend ones will live according to their
pleasure.” For those monks who came in late at night he, having attained the
condition of heat, assigned a lodging by this <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.274" href="#BD.1.274"></a>
light. So much so, that the monks came in late at night on purpose, (and) they
thought: “We will see the wonder of the psychic potency of the venerable Dabba,
the Mallian.” And having approached the venerable Dabba, the Mallian, they
spoke thus: “Reverend Dabba, assign a lodging to us.”</p>
<p>The venerable Dabba, the Mallian, spoke thus to them: “Where do your reverences
desire it? Where shall I assign it?”</p>
<p>Then these (monks) would quote a distant place on purpose, saying: “Reverend
Dabba, assign us a lodging on the Vulture’s Peak; your reverence, assign us a
lodging on the Robber’s Cliff; your reverence, assign us a lodging on the
slopes of Isigili Hill on the Black Rock; your reverence, assign us a lodging
on the slopes of Vebhāra at Sattapaṇṇi Cave; your reverence, assign us a
lodging in Sītā’s Wood on the slopes of the Snake Pool; your reverence, assign
us a lodging at the Gomata Glen; your reverence, assign us a lodging at the
Tinduka Glen; your reverence, assign us a lodging at the Tapodā Glen; your
reverence, assign us a lodging at the Tapodā Park; your reverence, assign us <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.160" href="#Vin.3.160"></a>
a lodging at Jīvaka’s Mango Grove;
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.275" href="#BD.1.275"></a>
your reverence, assign us a lodging in the deer-park at Maddakucchi.”</p>
<p>The venerable Dabba, the Mallian, having attained the condition of heat for
these (monks) went in front of each with his finger glowing; and they by the
light of the venerable Dabba, the Mallian, went behind him. The venerable
Dabba, the Mallian, assigned a lodging to them and said: “This is the couch,
this the bed, this the bolster, this the pillow, this a privy, that a privy,
this the drinking water, that the water for washing, this the staff, this is
(the form of) the Order’s agreement, this is the time it should be entered
upon, this the time it should be departed from.” Then the venerable Dabba, the
Mallian, having assigned a lodging to these (men), went back again to the
Bamboo Grove.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.8.1.5" href="#Bu-Ss.8.1.5"></a>
Now at that time the monks who were the followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka
were newly ordained and of little merit; they obtained whatever inferior
lodgings belonged to the Order and inferior meals. At that time the people in
Kājagaha wished to give the Elder monks alms-food having a specially good
seasoning, and ghee and oil and dainties. But to the monks who were the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.276" href="#BD.1.276"></a>
followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka they gave ordinary food, unseasoned
porridge of broken rice accompanied by sour gruel. These, after they had eaten
and had returned from their meal, asked the Elder monks: “What did you get,
your reverences, at the refectory? What did you?”</p>
<p>Some Elders spoke thus: “There was ghee for us, your reverences, there was oil
for us, there were dainties for us.”</p>
<p>But the monks who were the followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka spoke thus:
“Your reverences, there was nothing for us, (only) ordinary food, unseasoned
porridge of broken rice accompanied by sour gruel.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.8.1.6" href="#Bu-Ss.8.1.6"></a>
At that time a householder who had nice food gave to the Order in continuous
food supply a meal for four monks. He, together with his wife and children,
attended and served in the refectory. One offered boiled rice, another offered
curry, another offered oil, another offered dainties. Now at that time a meal
given by the householder who had nice food was apportioned for the following
day to the monks who were the followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka. Then the
householder who had nice food went to the park on some business and approached
the venerable Dabba, the Mallian, and having approached the venerable Dabba,
the Mallian, and greeted him, he sat down to one side. As he was sitting to one
side, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.161" href="#Vin.3.161"></a>
the venerable Dabba, the Mallian, rejoiced … gladdened with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk the householder who had nice food. Then when the householder who had nice
food had been rejoiced … gladdened with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk by the venerable Dabba, the Mallian, he said to the venerable Dabba, the
Mallian: “For whom, honoured sir, is the meal apportioned for tomorrow in our
house?”</p>
<p>“Householder, the food apportioned in your house for tomorrow is for the monks
who are the followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.277" href="#BD.1.277"></a>
Then the householder who had nice food was sorry and said: “How can these
depraved monks enjoy themselves in our house?” And going to his house, he gave
orders to a female slave, saying: “Having prepared for those who come to eat
tomorrow a seat in the store-room, serve them with porridge of broken rice
accompanied by sour gruel.”</p>
<p>“Very well, master,” the female slave answered the householder who had nice
food.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.8.1.7" href="#Bu-Ss.8.1.7"></a>
Then the monks who were the followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka said to one
another: “Yesterday, your reverences, a meal was allotted to us by the
householder who has nice food. Tomorrow the householder who has nice food,
attending with his wife and children, will serve us. Some will offer boiled
rice, some will offer curry, some will offer oil, some will offer dainties.”
These, because of their happiness, did not sleep that night as much as they had
expected.</p>
<p>Then the monks who were the followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka, rising up
early and setting out taking their bowls and robes, approached the dwelling of
the householder who had nice food. The female slave saw the monks who were
followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka coming from afar; and seeing them and
making ready a seat in the store-room, she said to the monks who were followers
of Mettiya and Bhummajaka: “Sit here, honoured sirs.”</p>
<p>Then the monks who were followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka thought: “But
undoubtedly the food will <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.278" href="#BD.1.278"></a>
not be ready, since we are made to sit in the store-room.”</p>
<p>Then the female slave came up with the porridge of broken rice accompanied by
sour gruel and said: “Eat, honoured sirs.”</p>
<p>“But, sister, we are those who enjoy a continuous supply of food.”</p>
<p>“I know that the masters enjoy a continuous supply of food. But yesterday I was
ordered by the householder: ‘Having prepared a seat in the store-room for those
who come for a meal today, serve them with porridge of broken rice accompanied
by sour gruel.’ Eat, honoured sirs,” she said.</p>
<p>Then the monks who were the followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka said:
“Yesterday, your reverences, the householder who has nice things to eat went to
Dabba, the Mallian, in the park; doubtless Dabba, the Mallian, set the
householder at variance with us.” These (monks) on account of their
lamentations did not eat as much as was expected.</p>
<p>Then the monks who were the followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka, after <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.162" href="#Vin.3.162"></a>
they had eaten and had returned from their meal, going to the park and putting
aside their bowls, sat down outside the store-room of the park, squatting
against their outer cloaks, silent, abashed, their shoulders bent, their heads
lowered, brooding, speechless.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.8.1.8" href="#Bu-Ss.8.1.8"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.279" href="#BD.1.279"></a>
Then the nun Mettiyā approached the monks who were followers of Mettiya and
Bhummajaka, and having approached them she said to the monks who were followers
of Mettiya and Bhummajaka: “I salute you, masters.” When she had spoken thus
the monks who were followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka did not respond. A
second time … A third time the monks who were followers of Mettiya and
Bhummajaka did not respond.</p>
<p>“Do I offend against the masters? Why do the masters not respond to me?” she
said.</p>
<p>“It is because you neglect us, sister, when we are got into difficulties by
Dabba, the Mallian.”</p>
<p>“What can I do, masters?” she said.</p>
<p>“If you would like, sister, this very day you could make the lord expel Dabba,
the Mallian.”</p>
<p>“What can I do, masters? How am I able to do that?” she said.</p>
<p>“Come, sister, go up to the lord, and having gone up, say to the lord: ‘Now,
lord, it is not suitable, it is not becoming that this quarter which should be
without fear, secure, without danger is the very quarter which is full of fear,
insecure, and full of danger. Where there was a calm, now there is a gale. It
seems the very water is blazing. I have been assaulted by master Dabba, the
Mallian.’”</p>
<p>“Very well, masters,” the nun Mettiyā answered the monks who were followers of
Mettiya and Bhummajaka, and she approached the lord. Having approached and
greeted the lord, she stood to one side. As she was standing to one side, the
nun Mettiyā spoke thus to the lord: “Now, lord, it is not suitable … by master
Dabba, the Mallian.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.8.1.9" href="#Bu-Ss.8.1.9"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.280" href="#BD.1.280"></a>
Now the lord on this occasion and in this connection, having had the Order of
monks convened, asked the venerable Dabba, the Mallian:</p>
<p>“Dabba, do you remember doing as the nun Mettiyā says?”</p>
<p>“Lord, the lord knows with regard to me,” he said. A second time … a third time
the lord said to the venerable Dabba, the Mallian …“with regard to me.”</p>
<p>“Dabba, the Dabbas do not give evasive answers like that. If what was done was
done by you, say so; if it was not done by you, say it was not.”</p>
<p>“Lord, since I was born, I cannot call to mind ever indulging in sexual
intercourse even in a dream; much less so when I was awake.”</p>
<p>Then the lord addressed the monks, saying: “Because of this, expel the nun
Mettiyā, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.163" href="#Vin.3.163"></a>
and take these monks to task.”</p>
<p>Having spoken thus, the lord rising up from his seat entered the <i lang="pi">vihāra</i>. Then these monks expelled the nun Mettiyā. Then the monks who were followers
of Mettiya and Bhummajaka said to those monks:</p>
<p>“Your reverences, do not expel the nun Mettiyā; she has not committed any sin;
she was urged on by us, because we were angry, displeased and wanted him out of
the way.”</p>
<p>“But are not your reverences defaming the venerable Dabba, the Mallian, with an
unfounded charge involving defeat?”</p>
<p>“It is so, your reverences,” they said.</p>
<p>Then those who were modest monks became annoyed, vexed and angry, and said:
“How can the monks who <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.281" href="#BD.1.281"></a>
are followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka defame the venerable Dabba, the
Mallian, with an unfounded charge involving defeat?” Then these monks told this
matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that you defamed Dabba, the Mallian, with an
unfounded charge involving defeat?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>Then the enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How can you, foolish
men, defame Dabba, the Mallian, with an unfounded charge involving defeat? It
is not, foolish men, for the benefit of unbelievers… Thus, monks, this course
of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, malignant, malicious and ill-tempered, should defame a monk with
an unfounded charge involving defeat, thinking: ‘Thus perhaps may I drive him
away from this Brahma-life,’ then, if afterwards he, being pressed or not being
pressed, the legal question turning out to be unfounded, if the monk confesses
his malice, it is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.”</span></p>
