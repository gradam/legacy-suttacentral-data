… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, said to the monk who shared his
brother’s cell: “Come, your reverence, we will set out on a tour of the
country.”</p>
<p>“I will not go, honoured sir,” he said, “my robe is worn thin.”</p>
<p>“Come, your reverence, I will give you a robe,” he said and he gave him a robe.
Then that monk heard: “It is said that the lord will set out on a tour of the
country.” Then it occurred to that monk: “I will not set out on a tour of the
country with the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans; I will set out on
a tour of the country with the lord.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, said to that monk: “Come
now, your reverence, we will set out on a tour of the country.”</p>
<p>“I will not set out on a tour of the country with you, honoured sir, I will set
out on a tour of the country with the lord.”</p>
<p>“But that robe, your reverence, which I gave you, that will set out on a tour
of the country with me,” he said, and angry and displeased, he tore it away.
Then that monk told this matter to the monks. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying: “How can the venerable Upananda, the son of the
Sakyans, himself having given a robe to a monk, angry and displeased, tear it
away?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Upananda, yourself <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.140" href="#BD.2.140"></a>
having given a robe to a monk, angry and displeased, tore it away?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.255" href="#Vin.3.255"></a>
yourself having given a robe to a monk, angry and displeased, tear it away? It
is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus,
monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, himself having given a robe to a monk, angry and displeased,
should tear it away or should cause it to be torn away, there is an offence of
expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.25.2.1" href="#Bu-NP.25.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means: … is monk to be understood in this case.</p>
<p><span class="term">To a monk</span> means:
<span class="gloss">to another monk.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Himself</span> means:
<span class="gloss">himself having given.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">A robe</span> means:
<span class="gloss">any one robe of the six (kinds of) robes (including) the least one fit for
assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Angry, displeased</span> means:
<span class="gloss">dissatisfied, the mind worsened, stubborn.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should tear it away</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he tears it away himself, there is an offence of expiation involving
forfeiture.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should cause it to be torn away</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he commands another, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If having commanded
once, he then tears many away, it is to be forfeited. It should be forfeited to
… an individual. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, having myself given this robe to a monk, it was <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.141" href="#BD.2.141"></a>
torn away by me; it is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to the Order.’</span> …
<span class="kamma">‘… the Order should give back … let the venerable ones give back … I will give
back this robe to the venerable one.’</span></span></p>
<p>Having given a robe to one who is ordained thinking that he is ordained, if
angry and displeased, he tears it away or causes it to be torn away, there is
an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he is in doubt as to whether
one is ordained, (then if) angry and displeased he tears it away or causes it
to be torn away, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. Having
given a robe to one who is ordained thinking that he is not ordained, if angry
and displeased, he tears it away or causes it to be torn away, there is an
offence of expiation involving forfeiture. Having given another requisite, if
angry and displeased, he tears it away or causes it to be torn away, there is
an offence of wrong-doing. Having given a robe or another requisite to one who
is not ordained, (then if) angry and displeased, he tears it away or causes it
to be torn away, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that one is
ordained when he is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is
in doubt as to whether one is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing.
If he thinks that one is not ordained when he is not ordained, there is an
offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>There is no offence if he gives it or takes (from him) in a friendly manner; if
he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.256" href="#Vin.3.256"></a>
