… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks, having gone to the army as there was business, stayed
with the army more than three nights. People … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the recluses, sons of the Sakyans, stay with the army? For us it is
not profitable and for us it is ill-gotten; such as we stop with the army for
the sake of livelihood, on account of child and wife.”</p>
<p>Monks heard these people … spread it about. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this group of six monks stay with the army for more than three
nights?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, stayed with the army for more than
three nights?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, stay with the army for more than three nights? It is
not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus,
monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">If there is for a monk some reason for going to an army, that monk may stay
with the army for two nights, three nights. Should he stay longer than that,
there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.49.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.49.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">If there is for a monk some reason for going to an army</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if there is a reason, if there is business.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.378" href="#BD.2.378"></a>
<span class="term">That monk may stay with the army for two nights, three nights</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he may stay two (or) three nights.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should he stay longer than that</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he stays with the army until sunset on the fourth day, there is an offence
of expiation.</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.49.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.49.2.2"></a>
If he thinks that it is more when it more than three nights, (and) stays with
the army, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether it
is more than three nights … If he thinks that it is less when it is more than
three nights … offence of expiation. If he thinks that it is more when it is
less than three nights, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt
as to whether it is less than three nights, there is an offence of wrong-doing.
If he thinks that it is less when it is less than three nights, there is no
offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.49.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.49.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if he stays for two (or) three nights; if he stays for less
than two (or) three nights; if having stayed for two nights, having departed on
the third night before dawn, he stays again; if he stays (because he is) ill;
if he stays because there is something to be done for one who is ill <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.107" href="#Vin.4.107"></a>
or if the army becomes invested by the opposing army; if he comes to be taken
possession of by something; if there are accidents; if he is mad, if he is the
first wrong-doer.</p>
