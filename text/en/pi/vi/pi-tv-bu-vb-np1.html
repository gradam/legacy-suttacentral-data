<h1>Monks’ Relinquishment 1: the kathina period</h1>

<p><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.195">Vin.3.195</a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.1">BD.2.1</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1861"></a>Venerables, these thirty rules entailing relinquishment and confession come up for recitation.</p>
<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>
<h3 class="anunidana1">First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-NP.1.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.1.1.1">Bu-NP.1.1.1</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1862"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Vesālī at the Gotamaka Shrine. At that time the Master had allowed the three robes to the monks. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.2">BD.2.2</a> Being aware of this, some monks belonging to the group of six entered the village with one set of three robes, remained in the forest with another set, and went to bathe with yet another set. The monk of few desires … complained and criticised them: “How can these monks keep extra robes?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1863"></a>After rebuking those monks in many ways they informed the Master. … “Is it true, monks, that you keep extra robes?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked them: <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.3">BD.2.3</a> “… Foolish men, how can you keep extra robes? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3 class="anupannatti1">Preliminary ruling</h3>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1864"></a>“If a monk keeps an extra robe, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession.”</p>
<p class="endsection"><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.4">BD.2.4</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1865"></a>In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3 class="anunidana2">Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-NP.1.2"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.1.2.1">Bu-NP.1.2.1</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1866"></a>Soon afterwards a robe was offered to Venerable Ānanda, but he wished to give it to Venerable Sāriputta who was staying at Saketa. Knowing that the Buddha had laid down a rule against keeping an extra robe, Venerable Ānanda thought, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.196">Vin.3.196</a> “What should I do in this situation?” He informed the Master, who said: “How long is it, Ānanda, before Sāriputta returns?”</p>
<p>“Nine or ten days, Master.”</p>
<p>The Master then spoke on the Dhamma and addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow you to keep an extra robe for ten days at the most. And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2 class="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1867"></a>“When his robe is finished and <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.5">BD.2.5</a> the <i>kathina</i> period has ended, a monk should keep an extra robe for ten days at the most. If he keeps it beyond that, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession.”</p>

<div class="gloss">
<p>He commits the offence entailing relinquishment on the dawn of the eleventh day. The robe is to be relinquished to a Sangha, a group, or an individual.</p>
<p>“And, monks, it is to be relinquished in this way. After approaching the Sangha, that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay homage at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his haunches, put the palms of his hands together, and <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.8">BD.2.8</a> say: ‘<span class="kamma">Bhante, this robe of mine has been kept over ten days and is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.</span>’ After relinquishing it, he is to confess the offence. The confession should be received by an experienced and competent monk.

<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1874"></a>“‘<span class="kamma">Bhante, let the Sangha listen to me. This robe belonging to monk so-and-so, which was to be relinquished, has been relinquished to the Sangha.

<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1875"></a>“After approaching several monks, that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay homage at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his haunches, put the palms of his hands together, and say: ‘Bhante, this robe of mine <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.197">Vin.3.197</a> has been kept over ten days and is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Venerables.’ After relinquishing it, he is to confess the offence. The confession should be received by an experienced and competent monk.

<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1876"></a>“‘Let the Venerables listen to me. This robe belonging to monk so-and-so, which was to be relinquished, has been relinquished to the Venerables. If it seems appropriate to the Venerables, the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.9">BD.2.9</a> Venerables should give this robe back to monk so-and-so.’</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1877"></a>“After approaching a single monk, that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his haunches, put the palms of his hands together, and say: ‘This robe of mine has been kept over ten days and is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Venerable One.’ After relinquishing it, he is to confess the offence. The confession should be received by that monk. The relinquished robe is then to be given back: ‘I give this robe back to the Venerable.’”</p>

If it is more than ten days, but he has doubts about it, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession. If it is more than ten days, but he perceives it as less than ten days, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession.</p>
<p>If it is undetermined, but he perceives it as determined, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession.

<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1879"></a>If he uses a robe which is to be relinquished without first relinquishing it, he commits an offence of bad conduct.

They informed the Master. “Monks, a relinquished robe <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.11">BD.2.11</a> is not not to be given back. If one does not give it back, there is an offence of bad conduct.”</p>
