At one time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Vesālī in the
Gotamaka shrine. At that time three robes were allowed to monks by the lord.
The <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.2" href="#BD.2.2"></a>
group of six monks, thinking: “Three robes are allowed by the lord,” entered a
village in one set of robes, remained in the monastery in another set of three
robes, went down to bathe in another set of three robes. Those who were modest
monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can the group
of six monks wear an extra robe?” Then these monks told this matter to the
lord.</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that you wear an extra robe?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.3" href="#BD.2.3"></a>
“How can you, foolish men, wear an extra robe? It is not, foolish men, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of
training should be set forth:</p>
<p>Whatever monk should wear an extra robe, there is an offence of expiation
involving forfeiture.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.4" href="#BD.2.4"></a>
Thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-NP.1.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.1.2.1" href="#Bu-NP.1.2.1"></a>
At that time an extra robe accrued to the venerable Ānanda; and the venerable
Ānanda was desirous of giving that robe to the venerable Sāriputta, but the
venerable Sāriputta was staying at Sāketa. Then it occurred to the venerable
Ānanda: “A rule of training laid down by the lord is that an extra robe should
not be worn. And this extra robe has accrued to me, and I am desirous of giving
this robe to the venerable Sāriputta, but the venerable <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.196" href="#Vin.3.196"></a>
Sāriputta is staying at Sāketa. Now what line of conduct should be followed by
me?” Then the venerable Ānanda told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“But, Ānanda, how long before Sāriputta will come (here)?”</p>
<p>“Lord, on the ninth or tenth day,” he said.</p>
<p>Then the lord on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk,
addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks, I allow you to wear an extra robe for at most ten days. And thus,
monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">When the robe-material is settled, when a monk’s <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.5" href="#BD.2.5"></a>
<i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges) have been removed, an extra robe may be worn for at most ten
days. For him who exceeds that (period), there is an offence of expiation
involving forfeiture.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.1.3.1" href="#Bu-NP.1.3.1"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.6" href="#BD.2.6"></a>
<span class="term">When the robe-material is settled</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the robe-material is made up for a monk, or lost or destroyed or burnt, or an
expectation of robe-material is disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">When the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges) have been removed</span> means:
<span class="gloss">they come to be removed because of a certain one of eight grounds, or they come
to be removed before the time by the Order.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">For at most ten days</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it may be worn for ten days at the maximum.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.7" href="#BD.2.7"></a>
<span class="term">An extra robe</span> means:
<span class="gloss">one that is not allotted, not assigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Robe-material</span> means:
<span class="gloss">any one robe-material of the six (kinds of) robe-materials (including) the
least one fit for assignment.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.1.3.2" href="#Bu-NP.1.3.2"></a>
<span class="term">For him who exceeds that period there is an offence involving forfeiture</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is to be forfeited on the eleventh day at sunrise; it should be forfeited to
the Order, or to a group or to an individual. And thus, monks, it should be
forfeited: That monk, approaching the Order, arranging his upper robe over one
shoulder, honouring the feet of the senior monks, sitting down on his haunches,
saluting with joined palms, should <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.8" href="#BD.2.8"></a>
speak thus:
<span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, this robe is to be forfeited by me, the ten days having
elapsed. I forfeit it to the Order.’</span> Having forfeited it, the offence should be confessed. The offence should be
acknowledged by an experienced, competent monk; the robe forfeited should be
given back (with the words): <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This robe of the monk so and so,
which had to be forfeited, is forfeited (by him) to the Order. If it seems
right to the Order, the Order should give back this robe to the monk so and
so.’</span></span></p>
<p>That monk, approaching two or three monks, arranging his upper robe over one
shoulder … joined palms, should speak thus: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, this robe <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.197" href="#Vin.3.197"></a>
is to be forfeited by me, the ten days having elapsed. I forfeit it to the
venerable ones.’</span> Having forfeited it, the offence should be confessed. The offence should be
acknowledged by an experienced, competent monk; the robe forfeited should be
given back (with the words): <span class="kamma">‘Let the venerable ones listen to me. This robe of the monk so and so, which
had to be forfeited, is forfeited (by him) to the venerable ones. If it seems
right to the venerable ones, let the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.9" href="#BD.2.9"></a>
venerable ones give back this robe to the monk so and so.’</span></p>
<p>That monk, approaching one monk, arranging his upper robe over one shoulder,
sitting down on his haunches, saluting with joined palms, should speak thus to
him: <span class="kamma">‘Your reverence, this robe is to be forfeited by me, the ten days having
elapsed. I forfeit it to the venerable one.’</span> Having forfeited it, the offence should be confessed. The offence should be
acknowledged by this monk; the robe forfeited should be given back (with the
words): <span class="kamma">‘I will give back this robe to the venerable one.’</span></p>

If he thinks that ten days have elapsed when they have done so, there is an
offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he is in doubt as to whether ten
days have elapsed, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he
does not think that ten days have elapsed when they have done so, there is an
offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that one is allotted
when it is not allotted, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.
If he thinks that one is assigned when it is not assigned, there is an offence
of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that one is bestowed when it is
not bestowed, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he
thinks that one is lost when it is not lost, there is an offence of expiation
involving forfeiture. If he thinks that one is destroyed when it is not
destroyed, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks
that one is burnt <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.10" href="#BD.2.10"></a>
when it is not burnt, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If
he thinks that one is stolen when it is not stolen, there is an offence of
expiation involving forfeiture. Not forfeiting the robe which had to be
forfeited, if he makes use of it, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he
thinks that the ten days have elapsed when they have not elapsed, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether the ten days have not
elapsed, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that the ten days
have not elapsed when they have not elapsed, there is no offence.</p>
<p></p>
<hr>
There is no offence if, within ten days, it is allotted, assigned, bestowed,
lost, destroyed, burnt, if they tear it from him, if they take it on trust; if
he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer. <hr>

Then the group of six monks did not give back a robe that had been forfeited.
They told this matter to the lord. He said: “Monks, a robe that has been
forfeited <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.11" href="#BD.2.11"></a>
is not not to be given back. Whosoever should not give it back, there is an
offence of wrong-doing.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.198" href="#Vin.3.198"></a></p>
