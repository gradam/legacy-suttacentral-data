… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks knowingly used to eat together with and be in communion
with and lie down in a sleeping place with Ariṭṭha, the monk who talked thus,
who had not acted according to the rule, who had got given up that view. Those
who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the group of six monks knowingly eat together with and be in communion
with and lie down in a sleeping place with Ariṭṭha … who has not given up that
view?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, knowingly eat together with and are
in communion with and lie down in a sleeping place with Ariṭṭha … who has not
given up that view?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, knowingly eat together with and be in communion with
and lie down in a sleeping place with Ariṭṭha … who has not given up that view?
It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And
thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should knowingly eat together with or be in communion with or lie
down in a sleeping place <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.28" href="#BD.3.28"></a>
with a monk who talks thus, who has not acted according to the rule, who has
not given up that view, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.69.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.69.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… monk is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">He knows</span> means:
<span class="gloss">either he knows by himself or others tell him or (someone) tells him.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Talks thus</span> means:
<span class="gloss">talks so, saying: ‘In so far as I understand <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> taught by the lord, it is that in following those things called
stumbling-blocks by the lord there is no stumbling-block at all.’</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Has not acted according to the rule</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he is suspended, not restored.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.29" href="#BD.3.29"></a>
<span class="term">Together with (to monk) who has not given up that view</span> means:
<span class="gloss">together with (a monk) who has not given up this view.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Or should eat with</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there are two (kinds of) eating, eating food and eating
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Eating food means, if he gives or accepts food, there is an offence of
expiation. Eating <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> means, he recites or causes to recite. If he recites or causes a line to be
recited, for every line there is an offence of expiation; if he recites or
causes a syllable to be recited, for every syllable there is an offence of
expiation. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.138" href="#Vin.4.138"></a>
</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Or should be in communion with</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he performs the Observance day (ceremony) or the Invitation ceremony or a
(formal) act of the Order together with one who is suspended, there is an
offence of expiation.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Or should lie down in a sleeping place with</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if one who is suspended is lying down and a monk lies down in a sleeping place
under the same roof, there is an offence of expiation. If a monk is lying down
and one who is suspended lies down, there is an offence of expiation. Or, if
both are lying down, there is an offence of expiation. If, getting up, they lie
down again and again, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.69.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.69.2.2"></a>
If he thinks that one is suspended when he is suspended, (and) eats together
with or is in communion <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.30" href="#BD.3.30"></a>
with or lies down in a sleeping place with (him), there is an offence of
expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether one is suspended … offence of
wrong-doing. If he thinks that one is not suspended when he is suspended … no
offence. If he thinks that one is suspended when he is not suspended, there is
an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether one is not
suspended, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that one is not
suspended when he is not suspended, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.69.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.69.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if he knows, “He is not suspended”; if he knows, “He was
suspended, he is restored”; if he knows, “He has given up that view”; if he is
mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
