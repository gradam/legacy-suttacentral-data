… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of seventeen monks were companions. Staying, they just stayed
together, setting forth, they just set forth together. These, spreading a
sleeping-place in a certain dwelling belonging to the Order, setting forth,
neither removed it nor had it removed, (but) set forth without having asked
(for permission). The lodging became eaten by white ants. Those who were modest
monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this group of seventeen monks, spreading a sleeping-place in a
dwelling belonging to the Order, setting forth, neither remove it nor have it
removed, (but) set forth without having asked (for permission, so that) the
lodging is eaten by white ants?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord
… He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of seventeen monks … belonging
to the Order, setting forth neither removed it … eaten by white ants?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can these foolish men … eaten by white ants? It is not, monks, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of
training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, spreading a sleeping-place or having it spread in a dwelling
belonging to the Order, setting forth, should neither remove it nor have it
removed, or should go away without asking (for permission), there is an offence
of expiation.”</span></p>

If he thinks that it belongs to the Order when it belongs to the Order,
spreading a sleeping-place or having it spread, setting forth should neither
remove it nor have it removed, or should go away without asking (for

it belongs to the Order … without asking (for permission), there is an offence
of expiation. If he thinks that it belongs to an individual <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.245" href="#BD.2.245"></a>
when it belongs to the Order, spreading a sleeping-place … or should go away

belongs to the Order when it belongs to an individual, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it belongs to an individual, there

when it belongs to an individual (but) to another individual, there is an

There is no offence if, having removed it, he goes away; if, having caused it
to be removed, he goes away; if, having asked (for permission), he goes away;
if it comes to be taken possession of by something; if going with the
expectation, standing there, he asks (for <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.246" href="#BD.2.246"></a>permission); if he becomes taken possession of by something; if there are
accidents; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
