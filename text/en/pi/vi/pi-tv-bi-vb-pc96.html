… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.345" href="#Vin.4.345"></a>
time a certain nun entered a village for almsfood without her vest. While she
was on the high road gusts of wind blew up her outer cloak. People shouted out:
“Beautiful is the waist of the lady.” That nun, being made fun of by the
people, became ashamed. Then that nun, having gone to a dwelling, told this
matter to the nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How
can this nun enter a village without her vest?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that this nun … without her vest?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can a nun enter a village without her vest? It is not, monks, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should enter a village without her vest, there is an offence of
expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Without a vest</span> means:
<span class="gloss">without a vest. </span></p>
<p><span class="term">Vest</span> means:
<span class="gloss">from below the collar-bone to above the navel, for the sake of covering this.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should enter a village</span> means:
<span class="gloss">in going beyond the enclosure of a village that is fenced in, there is an
offence of expiation. In entering the precincts of a village that is not fenced
in, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

There is no offence if she is one whose robe is stolen; if she is one whose
robe is lost; if she is ill; if she is not thinking; if she does not know; if
there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
<p class="end">The Ninth Division: that on a sunshade</p>
<p>Recited, ladies, are the hundred and sixty-six rules for offences of expiation.
Concerning them, I ask the ladies: I hope that you are quite pure in this
matter? And a second time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter?
And a third time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? The
ladies are quite pure in this matter, therefore they are silent; thus do I
understand this.</p>
