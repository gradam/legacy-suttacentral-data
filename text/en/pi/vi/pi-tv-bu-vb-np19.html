… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks engaged in various transactions in which gold and silver
was used. People … spread it about saying:</p>
<p>“How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, engage in various transactions in
which gold and silver is used, like householders who enjoy pleasures of the
senses?” Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest
monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this group of six monks engage in various transactions in which gold
and silver is used?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, engaged in various transactions in
which gold and silver is used?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How can you, foolish men,
engage in various transactions in which gold and silver is used? It is not,
foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks,
this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should engage in various transactions in which gold and silver is
used, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:

<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.107" href="#BD.2.107"></a>
<span class="term">Various</span> means:
<span class="gloss">shaped and unshaped and (partly) shaped, (partly) unshaped.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Shaped</span> means:
<span class="gloss">intended (as an ornament) for the head, intended (as an ornament) for the neck,
intended (as an ornament) for the hand, intended (as an ornament) for the foot,
intended (as an ornament) for the hips.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Unshaped</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is called shaped in a mass.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">(Partly) shaped, (partly) unshaped</span> means:
<span class="gloss">both of these.</span>
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.240" href="#Vin.3.240"></a></p>
<p><span class="term">Gold and silver</span> means:
<span class="gloss">what is the colour of the teacher, the <i lang="pi">kahāpaṇa</i>, the <i lang="pi">māsaka</i> of copper, the <i lang="pi">māsaka</i> of wood, the <i lang="pi">māsaka</i> of lac, used in business.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should engage in</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he gets shaped in exchange for shaped, there is an offence of expiation
involving forfeiture. If he gets unshaped in exchange for shaped, there is an
offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he gets (partly) shaped, (partly)
unshaped in exchange for shaped, there is an offence of expiation involving
forfeiture. If he gets shaped in exchange for unshaped … If he gets unshaped in
exchange for unshaped … If he gets (partly) shaped, (partly) unshaped in
exchange for unshaped … If he gets shaped in exchange for (partly) shaped,
(partly) unshaped … If he gets unshaped in exchange for (partly) shaped,
(partly) unshaped … If he gets (partly) shaped, (partly) unshaped in exchange
for (partly) shaped, (partly) unshaped, there is an offence of expiation
involving forfeiture.</span> It is to be forfeited in the midst of the Order. And thus, monks, should it be
forfeited: That monk, approaching the Order, arranging his upper robe over one
shoulder, honouring the feet of the senior monks, sitting down on his haunches,
saluting with joined palms, should speak thus: <span class="kamma">‘I, honoured sirs, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.108" href="#BD.2.108"></a>
engaged in various transactions in which gold and silver are used; this is to
be forfeited by me. I forfeit it to the Order.’</span> Having forfeited it, the offence should be confessed. The offence should be
acknowledged by an experienced, competent monk. If an attendant of a monastery
or a lay-follower comes there … <span class="add">See
<a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bu-vb-np18#Bu-NP.18.2">Bu-NP.18.2</a>;
<em>instead of</em>: except by the one who accepted gold and silver … and accepts gold and silver
<em>read</em>: except by the one who got gold and silver in exchange … and gets gold and
silver in exchange</span> … If he thinks that it is gold and silver when it is not gold and silver,
(and) gets gold and silver in exchange, there is an offence of expiation
involving forfeiture. If he is in doubt as to whether it is not gold and
silver, (and) gets gold and silver in exchange, there is an offence of
expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that it is not gold and silver
when it is not gold and silver, (and) gets gold and silver in exchange, there
is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that it is gold
and silver when it is not gold and silver, there is an offence of wrong-doing.
If he is in doubt as to whether it is not gold and silver, there is an offence
of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not gold and silver when it is not gold
and silver, there is no offence.</p>
<p>There is no offence if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
