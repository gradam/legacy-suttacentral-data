… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks intentionally aroused remorse in the group of seventeen
monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Your reverences, a rule of training laid down by the lord says that a person
under twenty years of age is not to be ordained; and you, (though) under twenty
years of age, are ordained. Then perhaps you are not really ordained.” These
cried out. Monks spoke thus: “Why do you, your reverences, cry out?”</p>
<p>“Your reverences, this group of six monks intentionally aroused remorse in us.”
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.149" href="#Vin.4.149"></a>
</p>
<p>Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of
six monks intentionally arouse remorse in monks?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, intentionally aroused remorse in
monks?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How can you, foolish men,
intentionally arouse remorse in monks? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should
be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should intentionally arouse remorse in a monk thinking, “There
will be no comfort for him even for a moment,” if having done it for just this
object, not for another, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.77.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.77.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… monk is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.54" href="#BD.3.54"></a>
<span class="term">In a monk</span> means:
<span class="gloss">in another monk.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Intentionally</span> means:
<span class="gloss">a transgression committed knowingly, consciously, deliberately.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should arouse remorse</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he arouses remorse saying: ‘Surely you, (though) under twenty years of age,
are ordained, surely you eat at the wrong time, surely you drink strong drink,
surely you sit in a private place together with a woman,’ there is an offence
of expiation.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Having done it for just this object, not for another</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there comes to be no other object whatever (for which) to arouse remorse.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.77.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.77.2.2"></a>
If he thinks that one is ordained when he is ordained, (and) intentionally
arouses remorse, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to
whether one is ordained… If he thinks that one is not ordained when he is
ordained … offence of expiation. If he intentionally arouses remorse in one who
is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that one is
ordained when he is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is
in doubt as to whether one is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing.
If he thinks that one is not ordained when he is not ordained, there is an
offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.77.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.77.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if, not desiring to arouse remorse, he speaks, saying:
‘Surely you, (though) under twenty years of age, are ordained … surely you sit
in a private place together with a woman; come now, find out (about it), do not
let there come to be remorse for you afterwards;’ if he is mad, if he is the
first wrong-doer.</p>
