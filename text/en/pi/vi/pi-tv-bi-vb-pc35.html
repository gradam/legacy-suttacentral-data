… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
Bhaddā Kāpilānī had spent the rains in Saketa. As she had some business to do,
she sent a messenger to the nun Thullanandā, saying: “If the lady Thullanandā
would give me quarters, I would come to Sāvatthī.” The nun Thullanandā spoke
thus: “Let her come, I will give it.” Then Bhaddā Kāpilānī went from Saketa to
Sāvatthī. The nun Thullanandā gave quarters to Bhaddā Kāpilānī. Now at that
time the nun Thullanandā was very learned, she was a repeater … <span class="add">see <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bi-vb-pc33#Bi-Pc.33.1">Bi-Pc.33.1</a></span> … she was skilled in giving <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk. The nun Thullanandā, thinking: “Those who are said to have few wants …
<span class="add">see <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bi-vb-pc33#Bi-Pc.33.1">Bi-Pc.33.1</a></span> … intent on hinting,” angry, displeased threw Bhaddā Kāpilānī out of her
quarters. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the lady Thullanandā, angry, displeased, having given quarters to the
lady Bhaddā Kāpilānī, throw her out?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā … threw her out?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … throw her out? It is not, monks, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, having given quarters to a nun, should, angry, displeased, throw
her out or have her thrown out, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
