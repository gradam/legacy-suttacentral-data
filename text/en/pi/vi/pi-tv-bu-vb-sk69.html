… in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks, having
sat down on a low seat, taught <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) sitting on a high seat. Those who were modest monks … spread it
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.147" href="#BD.3.147"></a>
about, saying: “How can this group of six monks … teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) sitting on a high seat?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, … taught <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) sitting on a high seat?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>How can you, foolish men, … teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) sitting on a high seat? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased …” And having rebuked them, having given
reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<hr>
<div class="jataka">
<p>“Formerly, monks, in Benares, the wife of a certain low class man came to be
pregnant. Then, monks, this low class woman spoke thus to this low class man:
‘Sir, I am pregnant; I want to eat a mango.’</p>
<p>‘There are no mangoes, it is not the mango season,’ he said.</p>
<p>Now at that time the king had a mango tree with a perpetual crop of fruit.
Then, monks, that low class man approached that mango tree; having approached,
having climbed up that mango tree, he remained hidden. Then, monks, the king
together with the brahmin priest, approached that mango tree; having
approached, having sat down on a high seat, he learnt a mantra. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.204" href="#Vin.4.204"></a>
Then, monks, it occurred to that low class man:</p>
<p>‘How unrighteous is this king, inasmuch as he learns a mantra, having sat down
on a high seat. This brahmin also is unrighteous, inasmuch as he, having sat
down on a low seat, teaches a mantra to (someone) sitting on a high seat. I too
am unrighteous, I who for the sake of a woman, steal the king’s mangoes. But
all this is quite gone,’ (and) he fell down just there.</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.148" href="#BD.3.148"></a>
Neither knows the goal, <br>
neither sees <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>,<br>
Neither he who teaches the mantra, <br>
nor he who learns according to what is not the rule. <br>
</p>
<p>My food is pure conjey<br>
of rice flavoured with meat, <br>
I do not therefore fare on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> praised by the noble. <br>
</p>
<p>Brahmin, shame on that gain of wealth, <br>
(that) gain of fame; <br>
That conduct (leads) to falling away <br>
or to walking by what is not the rule.</p>
<p>Go forth, great brahmin, <br>
for other creatures boil, <br>
Do not you, following what is not the rule, <br>
from that break like a pot.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<p>At that time, monks, to teach a mantra, having sat down on a low seat, to
(someone) sitting on a high <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.149" href="#BD.3.149"></a>
seat, was not liked by me. So, however could it now be not not liked to teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, having sat down on a low seat, to (someone) sitting on a high seat? It is
not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks,
this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>‘I will not teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, having sat down on a low seat, to (someone) sitting on a high seat (and) who
is not ill,’ is a training to be observed.”</p>
<p>Dhamma should not be taught, having sat down on a low seat, to (someone)
sitting on a high seat (and) who is not ill. Whoever out of disrespect, having
sat down on a low seat, teaches <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to someone sitting on a high seat (and) who is not ill, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</p>
<p>There is no offence if it is unintentional … if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
