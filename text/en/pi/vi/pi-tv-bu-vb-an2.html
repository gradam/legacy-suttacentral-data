At one time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta
Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. At that time the venerable Udāyin said: “It has
been forbidden by the lord to sit together with womenfolk, a man and a woman,
in a secret place on a secluded, convenient seat,” but he sat together with
that young girl, the one with the other, in a secret place, conversing at the
right time, talking <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> at the right time. A second time did Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, being invited,
come to that family. Visākhā saw the venerable Udāyin sitting together with
that girl, the one with the other, in a secret place, and seeing them she said
to the venerable Udāyin:</p>
<p>“This, honoured sir, is not right, it is not suitable for the master to sit
together with womenfolk, a man and a woman, in a secret place. Although,
honoured sir, the master has no desire for that thing, unbelieving people are
difficult to convince.”</p>
<p>But the venerable Udāyin took no heed after he had been spoken to thus by
Visākhā. Then Visākhā, when she had departed, told this matter to the monks.
Those who were modest monks … <span class="add">=
<a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bu-vb-an1#Bu-An.1.1">Bu-An.1.1</a>;
<em>the words</em> on a secluded, convenient seat
<em>are omitted here</em></span> …“And thus, monks, this course of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">And furthermore, if there is not a seat which is secluded and convenient, but
sufficiently so for speaking to a woman with lewd words, then whatever monk
should sit down on such a seat together with a woman, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.337" href="#BD.1.337"></a>
the one with the other, in a secret place, and a trustworthy woman lay-follower
seeing him should speak concerning a certain one of two matters: either one
entailing a formal meeting of the Order, or one involving expiation, and the
monk himself acknowledging that he was sitting down, should be dealt with
according to a certain one of two matters: as to whether it is one entailing a
formal meeting of the Order, or as to whether it is one involving expiation. Or
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.192" href="#Vin.3.192"></a>
that monk should be dealt with according to what that trustworthy woman
lay-follower should say. This again is an undetermined matter.”</span></p>

Set forth, venerable ones, are the two undetermined matters. In this connection
I ask the venerable ones: I hope that you are pure in this matter? A second
time I ask: I hope that you are pure in this matter? A third time I ask: I hope
that you are pure in this matter? The venerable ones are pure in this matter,
therefore they are silent. Thus do I understand.</p>

<h5>Its summary:</h5>
<p>Convenient and so and likewise, but not thus,<br>
such undetermined matters are well pointed out by the best of Buddhas.</p>
