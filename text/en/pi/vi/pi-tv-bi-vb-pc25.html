… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a certain nun having walked for alms, having spread out a damp robe, entered a
dwelling-place. A certain nun, having put on that robe, entered a village for
almsfood. She, having come out, asked the nuns: “Ladies, have you not seen my
robe?” The nuns told this matter to that nun. Then that nun … spread it about,
saying:</p>
<p>“How can this nun, without asking (for permission) put on my robe?” Then this
nun told this matter to the nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about,
saying: “How can this nun put on a nun’s robe without asking (for permission)?”
…</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that a nun … without asking (for permission)?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can a nun …
without asking (for permission)? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are
not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should wear a robe that should be handed back, there is an offence
of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bi-Pc.25.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.25.2.1" href="#Bi-Pc.25.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">A robe that should be handed back</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if she dresses in or puts on any one robe of the five (kinds of) robes of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.293" href="#BD.3.293"></a>
one who is ordained, either if it was not given to her or without asking
(permission) for it, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.25.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.25.2.2"></a>
If she thinks that she is ordained when she is ordained (and) wears a robe that
should be handed back, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as
to whether she is ordained … If she thinks that she is not ordained when she is
ordained … offence of expiation. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.283" href="#Vin.4.283"></a>
If she wears a robe of one who is not ordained and that should be handed back,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is ordained when she
is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to
whether she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks
that she is not ordained when she is not ordained, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.25.2.3" href="#Bi-Pc.25.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she gives it or, if asking (permission) for it, she
dresses in it or puts it on; if she is one whose robe is stolen, if she is one
whose robe is destroyed; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the
first wrong-doer.</p>
