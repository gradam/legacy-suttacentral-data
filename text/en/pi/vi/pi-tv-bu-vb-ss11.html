<h1>Monks’ Suspension 11: Agreeing to schism</h1>
</div>
<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.304"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.11.1"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1704"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. At that time Devadatta was pursuing schism in the Sangha, a break in transmission. The monks were saying, “Devadatta does not speak in accordance with the teaching and the training. How can he pursue schism in the Sangha?”</p>
<p>Then Kokālika, Kaṭamodakatissaka, Khaṇḍadeviyā-putta, and Samuddadatta said to those monks: “Venerables, do not say so.<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.175"></a> Devadatta does speak in accordance with the teaching and the training. And he speaks with our consent and approval. He knows about us and speaks for us, and we agree to this.”</p>
<p>The monks of few desires … complained and criticised them: “How can these monks support Devadatta’s pursuit of schism in the Sangha?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1705"></a>They informed the Master … and he questioned them: “Is it true, monks, that some monks support Devadatta’s pursuit of schism in the Sangha?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.305"></a>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked them: “… Monks, how can these foolish men support Devadatta’s pursuit of schism in the Sangha? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2 class="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1706"></a>“That monk may have one, two, or three monks who agree with him and support him, and they may say, ‘Venerables, do not admonish this monk. He speaks in accordance with the teaching and the training. And he speaks with our consent and approval. He knows about us and speaks for us, and we agree to this.’ The monks should say to those monks: ‘Venerables, do not say so. This monk does not speak in accordance with the teaching and the training. Do not consent to schism in the Sangha. Stay with the Sangha, for a united Sangha—in concord, in harmony, having a joint recitation—lives in comfort.’ If those monks continue as before, they should be admonished up to three times to make them stop. If they stop, good. If not, they incur an offence entailing suspension.”</p>

<p><span class="term">They should be admonished</span>:</p>
<div class="gloss">
<p>“And, monks, they should be admonished in this way. An experienced and competent monk should inform the Sangha:</p>
<div class="kamma">
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1715"></a>‘Bhante, let the Sangha listen to me. Monks so-and-so and so-and-so agree with and support monk so-and-so who is pursuing schism in the Sangha. They are not stopping that action. If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should admonish them to make them stop. This is the motion.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1716"></a>‘Bhante, let the Sangha listen to me. Monks so-and-so and so-and-so agree with and support monk so-and-so who is pursuing schism in the Sangha. They are not stopping that action. The Sangha admonishes them to make them stop. Any monk who agrees to admonishing them to make them stop should remain silent. Any monk who does not agree should say so.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1717"></a>‘For a second time … For a third time I speak on this matter: Bhante, let the Sangha listen to me. Monks so-and-so and so-and-so agree with and support monk so-and-so who is pursuing schism in the Sangha. They are not stopping that action. The Sangha admonishes them to make them stop.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.307"></a> Any monk who agrees to admonishing them to make them stop should remain silent. Any monk who does not agree should say so.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1718"></a>‘These monks have been admonished by the Sangha to make them stop that action. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”</p>
</div>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1719"></a>After the motion, they commit an offence of bad conduct. After two proclamations, they commit a serious offence. When the proclamation is finished, they commit an offence entailing suspension. For one who commits the offence entailing suspension, the offence of bad conduct and the serious offence are annulled. Two or three can be admonished together, but not more than that.</p>

<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1720"></a><span class="term">They incur an offence entailing suspension</span>: <span class="gloss">… This is the name and designation of this class of offence. Therefore, too, it is said that they incur an offence entailing suspension.</span></p>
