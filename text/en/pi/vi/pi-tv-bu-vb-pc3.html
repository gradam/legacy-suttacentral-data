… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks brought slander against monks for quarrelling, for disputing, for engaging in contention; hearing of this they were proclaimed for that and this dissension; hearing of that they were proclaimed for this and that dissension, so that quarrels that had not arisen arose, and also quarrels that had arisen rolled on for becoming more, for expansion. Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this group of six monks bring slander against monks for quarrelling, (so that) hearing of this … they were proclaimed … for expansion.”</p>
<p>Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, brought slander against monks for quarrelling, (so that) hearing of this … they were proclaimed … for expansion?” </p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: </p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, bring slander against monks for quarrelling, (so that) hearing of this … they were proclaimed … for expansion. It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased, nor for increase in those who are pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p><span class="rule">“In slander by monks, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Slander</span> means:
<span class="gloss">slander comes to be in two ways: making dear or desiring dissension.</span></p>
<p>One brings slander in ten ways: on account of birth and on account of name and on account of clan and on account of work and on account of craft and on account of disease and on account of distinguishing mark and on account of passion and on account of attainment and on account of mode of address.</p>
<p><span class="term">Birth</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there are two (kinds of) birth: low birth and high birth.</span>
<span class="term">Low birth</span> means:
<span class="gloss">birth as (a member of) a despised class, birth as a bamboo-plaiter, birth as a hunter, birth as a cartwright, birth as a refuse-scavenger</span>—this means low birth.
<span class="term">High birth</span> means:
<span class="gloss">birth as a noble, birth as a brahmin</span>—this means high birth …
<span class="term">Mode of address</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there are two modes of address: low mode of address and high mode of address.</span>
<span class="term">Low mode of address</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he says, “You are a camel …” … by calling him male and female</span>—this means low mode
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.13" href="#Vin.4.13"></a>
 of address.
<span class="term">High mode of address</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he says, “You are learned … a good bourn is to be expected for you”</span>—this means high mode of address.</p>
