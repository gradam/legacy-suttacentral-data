… at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding-place. At that time
the group of six monks, at the time of robe-making, asked for much yarn, so
that when the robe-material was made much yarn came to be over. Then it
occurred to the group of six monks: “Now then, your reverences, let us, asking
for more yarn, have robe-material woven by weavers.” Then the group of six
monks, asking for more yarn, had robe-material woven by weavers, but when the
robe-material was woven much yarn came to be over. A second time did the group
of six monks, asking for more yarn, have robe-material woven by weavers, but
when the robe-material was woven much yarn came to be over. A third time did
the group of six monks, asking for more yarn, have robe-material woven by
weavers. People … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, themselves asking for yarn, have
robe-material woven by weavers?”</p>
<p>Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the group of six monks, themselves asking for yarn, have robe-material
woven by weavers?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, yourselves asking for yarn, had
robe-material woven by weavers?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, yourselves asking for <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.143" href="#BD.2.143"></a>
yarn, have robe-material woven by weavers? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should
be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, himself asking for yarn, should have robe-material woven by
weavers, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-NP.26.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.26.2.1" href="#Bu-NP.26.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… is monk to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Himself</span> means:
<span class="gloss">himself asking.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Yarn</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the six (kinds of) yarn: linen, cotton, silk, wool, coarse hempen cloth,
canvas.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">By weavers</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he has it woven by weavers there is an offence of wrong-doing in the action.
It is <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.144" href="#BD.2.144"></a>
to be forfeited on acquisition; it should be forfeited to … an individual.
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.257" href="#Vin.3.257"></a>
And thus, monks, should it be forfeited:
<span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, this robe caused by me to be woven by weavers, having myself
asked for the yarn, is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to the Order.’</span> …
<span class="kamma">‘… the Order should give back … let the venerable ones give back … I will give
back this robe to the venerable one.’</span></span></p>
<p>If he thinks that it was caused to be woven when it was caused to be woven,
there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he is in doubt as to
whether it was caused to be woven, there is an offence of expiation involving
forfeiture. If he thinks that it was not caused to be woven when it was caused
to be woven, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he
thinks that it was caused to be woven when it was not caused to be woven, there
is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it was not caused
to be woven, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it was not
caused to be woven when it was not caused to be woven, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is no offence to sew a robe to a binding, to a belt, to a shoulder-strap, to
a bag for carrying the bowl in, to a water-strainer; if it belongs to
relations; if they are invited; if it is for another; if it is by means of his
own property; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
