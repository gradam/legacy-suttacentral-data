… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a cloth for the rains came to be allowed to monks by the lord. The group of six
monks, saying: “A cloth for the rains is allowed by the lord,” looked about
beforehand for robe-material as cloths for the rains, (and) making them
beforehand, they put them on, (but going) naked because the cloths for the
rains were old, they let their bodies get wet with the rain. Those who were
modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six monks look
about beforehand for robe-material as cloths for the rains, (and) making them
beforehand put them on, (but) because the cloths for the rains are old, (going)
naked, let their bodies get wet with the rain?” <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.135" href="#BD.2.135"></a>
Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, looking about beforehand for
robe-material as cloths for the rains, (and) making them beforehand put them
on, (but) because the cloths for the rains were old, (going) naked, you let
your bodies get wet with the rain?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, looking about before-hand for robe-material as
cloths for the rains, (and) making them beforehand put them on, (but) because
the cloths for the rains were old, (going) naked, let your bodies get wet with
the rain? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased
… And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">If he thinks, ‘A month of the hot weather remains,’ robe-material as a cloth
for the rains should be looked about for by that monk. If he thinks, ‘Half a
month of the hot weather remains,’ making it, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.253" href="#Vin.3.253"></a>
it should be put on. If he thinks, ‘More than a month of the hot weather
remains,’ and should look about for robe-material as a cloth for the rains; if
he thinks, ‘More than half a month of the hot weather remains,’ and making it,
should put it on, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-NP.24.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.24.2.1" href="#Bu-NP.24.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">If he thinks, ‘A month of the hot weather remains,’ robe-material as a cloth
for the rains should be looked about for by that monk</span> means:
<span class="gloss">having approached those people who formerly gave robe material as cloths for
the rains, he may speak to them thus: ‘It is the time for robe-material as
cloths for the rains, it is the season for robe-material as cloths for the
rains, and other people are giving robe-material as cloths for the rains.’ He
should not say, ‘Give me robe-material as a cloth for the rains, bring me
robe-material as a cloth for the rains, barter robe-material for me as a cloth
for the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.136" href="#BD.2.136"></a>
rains, get in exchange robe-material for me as a cloth for the rains.’</span></p>
<p><span class="term">If he thinks, ‘Half a month of the hot weather remains,’ making it, it should
be put on</span> means:
<span class="gloss">making it in the half month of the hot weather remaining, it should be put on.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">If he thinks, ‘More than a month of the hot weather remains’</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he looks about for robe-material as a cloth for the rains while over a month
of the hot weather remains, there is an offence of expiation involving
forfeiture.</span></p>
<p>If he thinks, ‘More than half a month of the hot weather remains,’ making it he
puts it on while more than half a month of the hot weather remains, it is to be
forfeited. It should be forfeited to … an individual. And thus, monks, should
it be forfeited: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, this robe-material as a cloth for the rains was looked about
for by me while more than a month of the hot weather remained; making it, it
was put on while more than half a month of the hot weather remained; it is to
be forfeited. I forfeit it to the Order.’</span> …
<span class="kamma">‘… the Order should give back … let the venerable ones give back … I will give
back this cloth for the rains to the venerable one.’</span></p>
<p>If he thinks that more than a month of the hot weather remains when there is
more, and looks about for robe-material as a cloth for the rains, there is an
offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he is in doubt as to whether more
than a month of the hot weather remains, and looks about for robe-material as a
cloth for the rains, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If
he thinks that less than a month of the hot weather remains when there is more,
and looks about for robe-material as a cloth for the rains, there is an offence
of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that more than half a month of
the hot weather remains when there is more, (and) making it, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.137" href="#BD.2.137"></a>
puts it on, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he is in
doubt as to whether more than half a month of the hot weather remains, (and)
making it, puts it on, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.
If he thinks that less than half a month of the hot weather remains when there
is more, (and) making it, puts it on, there is an offence of expiation
involving forfeiture. If (going) naked, although there is a cloth for the
rains, he lets his body get wet with the rain, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he thinks that more than a month of the hot weather remains
when there is less, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to
whether less than a month of the hot weather remains, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he thinks that less than a month of the hot weather remains
when there is less, there is no offence. If he thinks that more than half a
month of the hot weather remains when there is less, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether less than half a month of the hot
weather remains, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.254" href="#Vin.3.254"></a>
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that less than half a month of
the hot weather remains when there is less, there is no offence.</p>
<p>There is no offence if, thinking, ‘A month of the hot weather remains,’ he
looks about for robe-material as a cloth for the rains; if, thinking, ‘Half a
month of the hot weather remains,’ making it, he puts it on; if, thinking,
‘Less than a month of the hot weather remains,’ he looks about for
robe-material as a cloth for the rains; if, thinking, ‘Less than half a month
of the hot weather remains,’ making it, he puts it on; if the cloth for the
rains that has been looked for is worn out during the rains; if the cloth for
the rains that has <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.138" href="#BD.2.138"></a>
been put on is worn out during the rains; washing them, they should be laid
aside, they should be put on (again) at the right season. (There is no offence)
if the robe-material is stolen, if the robe-material is destroyed, if there are
accidents; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
