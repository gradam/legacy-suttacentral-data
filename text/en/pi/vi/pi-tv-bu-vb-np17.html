<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.94" href="#BD.2.94"></a>
… among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan monastery. At that time the
group of six monks had sheep’s wool <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.235" href="#Vin.3.235"></a>
washed and dyed and combed by nuns. The nuns, through washing, dyeing, combing
the sheep’s wool, neglected the exposition, the interrogation, the higher
morality, the higher thought, the higher insight. Then Mahāpajāpatī the Gotamid
approached the lord, and having approached, greeting the lord, she stood at a
respectful distance. As she was standing at a respectful distance, the lord
spoke thus to Mahāpajāpatī the Gotamid:</p>
<p>“Gotami, I hope that the nuns are zealous, ardent, (with) a self that is
striving?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.95" href="#BD.2.95"></a>
“Whence, lord, is there zeal in the nuns? The masters, the group of six monks,
have sheep’s wool washed and dyed and combed by nuns. The nuns … neglect the
exposition, the interrogation, the higher morality, the higher thought, the
higher insight.”</p>
<p>Then the lord … gladdened Mahāpajāpatī the Gotamid with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk. Then Mahāpajāpatī the Gotamid … gladdened by the lord with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk, greeting the lord, departed keeping her right side towards him. Then the
lord, in this connection, on this occasion, having had the Order of monks
convened, asked the group of six monks:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, had sheep’s wool washed and dyed and
combed by nuns?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>“Were they relations of yours, monks, or not relations?”</p>
<p>“They were not relations, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>“Foolish men, those who are not relations do not know what is suitable or what
is unsuitable, or what is pleasant or what is unpleasant to those who are not
relations. Thus you, foolish men, will have sheep’s wool washed and dyed and
combed by nuns who are not relations? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should
be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should have sheep’s wool washed or dyed or combed by a nun who is
not a relation, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he who …</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Monk</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… is monk to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.96" href="#BD.2.96"></a>
<span class="term">(A nun) who is not a relation means</span>:
<span class="gloss">one who is not related on the mother’s side or on the father’s side back
through seven generations.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Nun</span> means:
<span class="gloss">one ordained by both Orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Wash</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he gives an order—there is an offence of wrong-doing. If washed, it is to be
forfeited.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Dye</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he gives an order—there is an offence of wrong-doing. If dyed, it is to be
forfeited.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Comb</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he gives an order—there is an offence of wrong-doing. If combed
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.236" href="#Vin.3.236"></a>
it is to be forfeited. It should be forfeited … to an individual. And thus,
monks, should it be forfeited: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, this sheep’s wool, caused by me to be washed by a nun who is
not a relation, is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to the Order.’</span> …
<span class="kamma">‘… the Order should give back … let the venerable ones give back … I will give
back this sheep’s wool to the venerable one.’</span></span></p>
<p>If he thinks that a woman is not a relation when she is not a relation and
makes her wash sheep’s wool, there is an offence of expiation involving
forfeiture. If he thinks that a woman is not a relation when she is not a
relation and makes her wash, makes her dye sheep’s wool, there is an offence of
wrong-doing together with an offence involving forfeiture. If he thinks that a
woman is not a relation when she is not a relation and makes her wash, makes
her comb sheep’s wool, there is an offence of wrong-doing together with an
offence involving forfeiture. If he thinks that a woman is not a relation when
she is not a relation and makes her wash, makes her dye, makes her comb sheep’s
wool, there are two offences of wrong-doing together with an offence involving
forfeiture.</p>

<p>If he is in doubt as to whether a woman is not a relation … If he thinks that a
woman is a relation when she is not a relation … If he makes her wash another’s
sheep’s wool, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he makes a woman who has

offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether a woman is a relation,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that a woman is a relation
when she is a relation, there is no offence.</p>
<p>There is no offence if a female relation is washing it <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.98" href="#BD.2.98"></a>
when a woman assistant who is not a relation is (helping); if she washes it
unasked; if he makes her wash unused goods tied up in a bundle; if it is
(washed) by a female probationer, by a female novice; if he is mad, if he is
the first wrong-doer.</p>
