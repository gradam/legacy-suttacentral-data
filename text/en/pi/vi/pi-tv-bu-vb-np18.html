… at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding-place. Now at that
time <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.237" href="#Vin.3.237"></a>
the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, was dependent as a regular
diner on a certain family in Rājagaha. When solid food or soft food came to
that family, a portion from that was set aside for the venerable Upananda, the
son of the Sakyans. Now at that time meat came one evening to that family, a
portion from that was set aside for the venerable Upananda, the son of the
Sakyans. A young boy belonging to that family, getting up in the night towards
morning, cried: “Give me meat.” Then the man spoke thus to his wife:</p>
<p>“Give the boy the master’s portion, having got another (portion) in exchange,
we will give that to the master.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, dressing in the morning
and taking his bowl and robe, approached the family, and having approached he
sat down on the appointed seat. Then that man approached the venerable
Upananda, the son of the Sakyans; having approached, having greeted the
venerable Upananda, the, son of the Sakyans, he sat down at a respectful
distance. As he was sitting at a respectful distance, that man spoke thus to
the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans:</p>
<p>“Yesterday evening, honoured sir, (some) meat came, a portion from that was set
aside for the master. This young boy, honoured sir, got up in the night towards
morning and cried: ‘Give me meat,’ and the master’s <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.100" href="#BD.2.100"></a>
portion was given to the boy. What could you get with a <i lang="pi">kahāpaṇa</i>, honoured sir?”</p>
<p>“(The use of) <i lang="pi">kahāpaṇas</i> is given up by me, sir,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes, honoured sir, it is given up.”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless give me a <i lang="pi">kahāpaṇa</i>, sir,” he said. Then that man having given the venerable Upananda, the son of
the Sakyans, a <i lang="pi">kahāpaṇa</i>, looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“As we accept gold and silver, so do these recluses, sons of the Sakyans,
accept gold and silver.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.101" href="#BD.2.101"></a>
Monks heard that man who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying: “How can the venerable Upananda, the son of the
Sakyans, accept gold and silver?” Then these monks told this matter to the
lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Upananda, accepted gold and silver?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, accept gold and silver?</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.102" href="#BD.2.102"></a>
It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And
thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should take gold and silver, or should get another to take it
(for him), or should consent to its being kept in deposit (for him), there is
an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.238" href="#Vin.3.238"></a>
</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-NP.18.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.18.2.1" href="#Bu-NP.18.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… is monk to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Gold</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is called the colour of the teacher.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Silver</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the <i lang="pi">kahāpaṇa</i>, the <i lang="pi">masaka</i> of copper, the <i lang="pi">māsaka</i> of wood, the <i lang="pi">māsaka</i> of lac, used in business.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.103" href="#BD.2.103"></a>
<span class="term">Should take</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he himself takes, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should get another to take it (for him)</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he causes another to take it, there is an offence of expiation involving
forfeiture.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should consent to its being kept in deposit</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he says: ‘Let this come to be for the master,’ or consents to its being kept
in deposit, it is to be forfeited. It should be forfeited in the midst of the
Order. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: That monk, approaching the
Order, arranging his upper robe over one shoulder, honouring the feet of the
senior monks, sitting down on his haunches, saluting with joined palms, should
speak thus: <span class="kamma">‘I, honoured sirs, accepted gold and silver, this is to be forfeited by me. I
forfeit it to the Order.’</span> Having forfeited it, the offence should be confessed. The offence should be
acknowledged by an experienced, competent monk. If an attendant of a monastery
or a lay-follower comes there, he should be told: ‘Sir, find out about this.’
If he says: ‘What could be got with this?’ he should not be told: ‘Bring this
or that’; oil or ghee or honey or molasses may be mentioned as allowable. If he
brings what is allowable, having got it in exchange for this, it may be made
use of by all except the one who accepted the gold and silver. If he can
undertake to do this in this way, it is well. But if he cannot undertake to do
it, he <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.104" href="#BD.2.104"></a>
should be told: ‘Sir, remove this.’ If he removes it, it is well. But if he
does not remove it, a monk endowed with five qualities should be agreed upon as
silver-remover: one who would not follow a wrong course through desire, one who
would not follow a wrong course through hatred, one who would not follow a
wrong course through stupidity, one who would not follow a wrong course through
fear, and one who would know what is removed and what is not removed. And thus,
monks, should he be agreed upon: First, the monk is to be requested. Having
been requested, the Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk,
saying: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. If it seems right to the Order, the
Order should agree upon the monk so and so as silver-remover. This is the
motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. The Order agrees upon the
monk so and so as silver-remover. If it is pleasing to the venerable ones to
agree upon the monk so and so as silver-remover, let them be silent; if it is
not pleasing, they should speak. The monk so and so is agreed upon by the Order
as silver-remover, and it is right … Thus do I understand this.’</span> It is to be removed by the monk agreed upon making no sign. If, making a sign,
he lets it drop, there is an offence of wrong-doing. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.239" href="#Vin.3.239"></a>
</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.105" href="#BD.2.105"></a>
If he thinks that it is gold and silver when it is gold and silver, (and)
accepts gold and silver, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.
If he is in doubt as to whether it is gold and silver, (and) accepts gold and
silver, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks
that it is not gold and silver when it is gold and silver, (and) accepts gold
and silver, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks
that it is gold and silver when it is not gold and silver, there is an offence
of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is not gold and silver,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not gold and silver
when it is not gold and silver, there is no offence.</p>
<p>There is no offence if, taking it or causing (another, to take it within a
monastery or within a house, he lays it aside, thinking, ‘It will be for him
who will take it’; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
