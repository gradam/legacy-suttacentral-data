At one time, the Awakened One, the Lord was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta
Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time monks under probation
consented to regular monks greeting them, standing up before them, saluting
with joined palms, doing the proper duties, bringing forward a seat, bringing
forward a sleeping-place, water for (washing) the feet, a footstool, a
foot-stand, receiving the bowl and robe, treating their backs by massaging.
Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about,
saying: “How can these monks who are under probation consent to regular monks
greeting … treating their backs by massaging?” Then these monks told this
matter to the Lord. Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having
had the Order of monks convened, questioned the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that monks who are under probation consent to
regular monks greeting … treating their backs by massaging?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” The Awakened One, the Lord rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can these monks who are under probation consent to regular monks …
treating their backs by massaging? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are
not (yet) pleased …” And having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he
addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“A monk who is under probation, monks, should not consent to regular monks
greeting him … treating his back by massaging. Whoever should consent to (any
of these actions), there is an offence of wrong-doing. I allow, monks, the
mutual greeting, standing up before … treating of backs by massaging between
monks who are under probation according to their seniority. I allow, monks,
five things for monks under <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.45" href="#BD.5.45"></a>
probation according to their seniority: Observance, Invitation, cloths for the
rains, gifts (to the Order) rice.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.12.1.2" href="#Kd.12.1.2"></a>
“Well now, monks, I will lay down the conduct for monks under probation, so
that monks under probation <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.32" href="#Vin.2.32"></a>
may conduct themselves according to it. A monk under probation, monks, should
conduct himself properly. This is the proper conduct in this case: he should
not ordain, he should not give guidance, a novice should not attend him, he
should not consent to an agreement to exhort nuns, even if agreed upon he
should not exhort nuns, he should not fall into that same offence for which he
was granted probation, nor into another that is similar, nor into one that is
worse, he should not find fault with the (formal) act, he should not find fault
with those who carry out the (formal) act, he should not suspend a regular
monk’s Observance, he should not suspend his Invitation, he should not issue
commands, should not set up authority, he should not ask for leave, he should
not reprove, he should not make remember, he should not quarrel with monks.
Nor, monks, should a monk under probation walk in front of a regular monk, nor
sit down in front of him. Whatever is the Order’s last seat, last
sleeping-place, last dwelling-place—that should be given to him and he should
consent to it. Monks, a monk under probation should not approach the families
of a regular monk either as the novice who walks in front of him or as the
novice who walks behind him. He should not undertake the forest-practice, he
should not undertake the almsman’s <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.46" href="#BD.5.46"></a>
practice, he should not have almsfood taken back for this reason: that he
thinks, ‘Do not let them find out about me’. Monks, a monk under probation
should announce it when he is in-coming, he should announce it to (another who
is) in-coming, he should announce it at the Observance, he should announce it
at the Invitation, if he is ill he should also announce it by means of a
messenger.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.12.1.3" href="#Kd.12.1.3"></a>
“Monks, a monk under probation should not go from a residence where there are
monks to a residence where there are no monks, except with a regular (monk),
unless there is a danger. Monks, a monk under probation should not go from, a
residence where there are monks to what is not a residence where there are no
monks, except with a regular (monk), unless there is a danger. Monks, a monk
under probation should not go from a residence where there are monks to a
residence or to what is not a residence where there are no monks, except with a

“Monks, a monk under probation should not go from a residence where there are
monks to a residence where there are monks if the monks there should belong to
a different communion, except with a regular (monk), <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.33" href="#Vin.2.33"></a>

<p>“Monks, a monk under probation may go from a residence where there are monks to
a residence where there are monks if the monks there should belong to the same
communion and if he knows, ‘I am able to arrive this very day.’ Monks, a monk
under probation may go from a residence where there are monks to what is not a

“Monks, a monk under probation should not stay in a residence under one roofing
with a regular monk, he should not stay in what is not a residence under one
roofing (with him), he should not stay in a residence or in what is not a
residence under one roofing (with him). Having seen a regular monk, he should
get up from his seat. He should offer his seat to the regular monk. A monk
under probation should not sit down on the same seat with a regular monk, he
should not sit down on a high seat if he is sitting down on a low seat, he
should not sit down on a seat if he is sitting on the ground, he <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.48" href="#BD.5.48"></a>
should not pace up and down in the same place for pacing up and down in, he
should not pace up and down in a high place for pacing up and down in if he is
pacing up and down in a low place for pacing up and down in, he should not pace
up and down in a place for pacing up and down in if he is pacing up and down on
the ground.</p>
<p>“Monks, a monk under probation should not stay in a residence under one roofing
with a senior monk who is under probation … with a monk who deserves to be sent
back to the beginning … with a monk who deserves <i lang="pi">mānatta</i> (discipline) … with a monk who is undergoing <i lang="pi">mānatta</i> (discipline) … with a monk who deserves rehabilitation, he should not stay in

<p>If, monks, one under probation as the fourth (member) should grant probation,

Then the venerable Upāli approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted
the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a
respectful distance, the venerable Upāli spoke thus to the Lord: “Now, Lord,
how many (kinds of) interruptions are there for a monk under probation?”</p>
<p>“There are three (kinds of) interruptions, Upāli, for a monk under probation:
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.34" href="#Vin.2.34"></a>
dwelling with; dwelling away,
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.49" href="#BD.5.49"></a>

interruptions for a monk under probation.”</p>

Now at that time a large Order of monks had gathered together at Sāvatthī;
monks under probation were not able to carry through their probation. They told
this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to postpone probation.</span> And thus, monks, should it be postponed: That monk who is under probation,
having approached one monk, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder,
having sat down on his haunches, having saluted with joined palms, should speak
thus to him: ‘<span class="kamma">I am postponing probation</span>’—probation comes to be postponed; ‘<span class="kamma">I am postponing the observance</span>’,—probation comes to be postponed.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.12.3.2" href="#Kd.12.3.2"></a>
Now at that time monks went away from Sāvatthī to this place and that; monks
under probation were not able to carry through their probation. They told this
matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to take up probation.</span> And thus, monks, should it be taken up: If that monk who is under probation,
having approached one monk … having saluted with joined palms, should speak
thus to him: ‘<span class="kamma">I am taking up probation</span>’—probation comes to be taken up; ‘<span class="kamma">I am taking up the observance</span>’—probation comes to be taken up.”</p>

Forest, bringing back food, when coming in, at the Observance, <br>
and at the Invitation, and by a messenger, and he may go to where there are
monks. /<br>
Under one roofing and getting up and likewise in regard to offering, /<br>
on a seat, in a high place for pacing up and down in, <br>
on the ground and not in a place for pacing up and down in, /<br>
With a senior—not a (formal) act, interruptions and carryings through, <br>
