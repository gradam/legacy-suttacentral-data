… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, having fallen into the offence
of intentional emission of semen, said to his brother, the monk who shared his
cell:</p>
<p>“I, your reverence, have fallen into the offence of intentional emission of
semen; do not tell anyone else.”</p>
<p>Now at that time a certain monk, having fallen into the offence of intentional
emission of semen, asked the Order for probation on account of this offence.
The Order granted him probation on account of this offence. He, being under
probation, having seen that monk, spoke thus:</p>
<p>“I, your reverence, having fallen into the offence of intentional emission of
semen, asked the Order for probation on account of this offence. The Order
granted me probation on account of this offence of his, so I am under
probation. I, your reverence, am experiencing a feeling, let the venerable one
conceal me, saying: ‘He is experiencing a feeling.’”</p>
<p>“But, your reverence, does another who falls into this offence also act
likewise?”</p>
<p>“Yes, your reverence.”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, this venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, having fallen
into the offence of intentional emission of semen, said to me: ‘ Do not tell
anyone.’”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.8" href="#BD.3.8"></a>
“But are you, then, your reverence, not concealing (him)?”</p>
<p>“Yes, your reverence.”</p>
<p>Then that monk told this matter to the monks. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this monk knowingly conceal a monk’s very bad offence?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monk, knowingly concealed a monk’s very bad
offence?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, knowingly conceal a monk’s very bad offence? It is
not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus,
monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should knowingly conceal a monk’s very bad offence, there is an
offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><span class="term">Very bad offence</span> means:
<span class="gloss">both the four involving defeat and the thirteen entailing a formal meeting of
the Order.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should conceal</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he thinks, ‘Knowing this they will reprove him, they will remind him, they
will jeer at him, they will scoff at him, they will shame him, I will not
tell,’ in the mere fact that responsibility is thrown off, there is an offence
of expiation.</span></p>

If he thinks that it is a very bad offence when it is a very bad offence (and)
conceals it, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether
it is a very <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.9" href="#BD.3.9"></a>
bad offence (and) conceals it, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks
that it is not a very bad offence when it is a very bad offence (and) conceals
it, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he conceals an offence that is not a
very bad one, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he conceals a
transgression that is very bad or that is not very bad of one who is not
ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is a very
bad offence when it is not a very bad offence, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is not a very bad offence,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not a very bad
offence when it is not a very bad offence, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>

There is no offence if he does not tell, thinking: “There will come to be
quarrel or dispute or strife or contention for the Order”; if he does not tell,
thinking: “There will come to be a schism in the Order or dissension in the
Order”; if he does not tell, thinking: “This one, harsh, rough, will be an
obstacle to life or to the Brahma-life”; if he does not tell, not seeing other
suitable monks; if he does not tell (though) not desiring to hide (him); if he
does not tell, thinking: “It will be evident from his own action”; if he is
mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
