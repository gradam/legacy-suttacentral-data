… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the venerable Udāyin frequented families, and he approached many families. Then
the venerable Udāyin, dressing in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, went
up to a certain family. Now at that time the house-wife was sitting at the
entrance-door, and the daughter-in-law of the house was sitting at the door of
the living-room. Then the venerable Udāyin went up to the house-wife, and
having gone up he gave <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> privately to the house-wife. Then the daughter-in-law of the house thought
thus:</p>
<p>“What now, is this recluse the mother-in-law’s lover, or is he speaking
offensively?”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Udāyin, having given <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> privately to the house-wife, approached the daughter-in-law of the house, and
having approached he gave <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> privately to the daughter-in-law of the house. Then the house-wife thought:</p>
<p>“What now, is this recluse the lover of the daughter-in-law of the house, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.21" href="#Vin.4.21"></a>
or is he speaking offensively?”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Udāyin, having given <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> privately to the daughter-in-law of the house, departed. Then the house-wife
said to the daughter-in-law of the house:</p>
<p>“Well now, what did this recluse say to you?”</p>
<p>“Lady, he taught <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to me; but what did he say to the lady?”</p>
<p>“He also taught <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to me,” she said.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.204" href="#BD.2.204"></a>
These (women) looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can master Udāyin teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> privately? Should not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> be given clearly and openly?”</p>
<p>Monks heard these women who looked down upon, criticised, spread it about.
Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about,
saying:</p>
<p>“How can the venerable Udāyin teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to women?”</p>
<p>Then these monks told this matter to the lord …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Udāyin, taught <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to women?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to women? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased
… And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p><span class="subrule">“Whatever monk should teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to women, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.7.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.7.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.7.2.1"></a>
Now -at that time female lay-followers, seeing monks, spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Please, masters, teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.”</p>
<p>“Sisters, it is not allowable to teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to women.”</p>
<p>“Please, masters, teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> in five or six sentences, it is possible to learn <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> in a few (sentences).”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.205" href="#BD.2.205"></a>
“Sisters, it is not allowable to teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to women,” and being scrupulous, they did not teach. The female lay-followers
looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can these masters, being asked by us, not teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>?”</p>
<p>Monks heard these female lay-followers who looked down upon, criticised, spread
it about. Then these monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord, on this
occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks,
saying:</p>
<p>“Monks, I allow you to teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to women in five or six sentences. And thus, monks, this rule of training
should be set forth:</p>
<p><span class="subrule">“Whatever monk should teach
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to women in more than five or six sentences, there is an offence of
expiation.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.22" href="#Vin.4.22"></a>
</span></p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.7.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.7.3.1" href="#Bu-Pc.7.3.1"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks thought: “It is allowed by the lord to
teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to women in five or six sentences”; and these, making an unlearned man sit
down near by, taught <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to women in more than five or six sentences. Those who were modest monks
looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the group of six monks, making an unlearned man sit down near by,
teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to women in more than five or six sentences?”</p>
<p>Then these monks told this matter to the lord …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks … to women?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men … to women? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.206" href="#BD.2.206"></a>
pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to women in more than five or six sentences, except a learned man (be
present), there is offence of expiation.” </span></p>

<p><span class="term">Should teach</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he teaches by line, for every line there is an offence of expiation. If he

If he thinks that it is a woman when it is a woman (and) teaches <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> in more than five or six sentences, except a learned man (be present), there
is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether it is a woman (and)

<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.7.4.3" href="#Bu-Pc.7.4.3"></a>
There is no offence if a learned man (be present); if he teaches <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> in five or six sentences; if he teaches <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> in less than five or six sentences; if he teaches having risen, having sat

having asked a question, he speaks; if talking for the good of another, a woman
hears; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
