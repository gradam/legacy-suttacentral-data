… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the former wife of the venerable Udāyin had gone forth among the nuns. She
frequently came to the venerable Udāyin, and the venerable Udāyin frequently
went to this nun. Now at one time the venerable Udāyin was sitting down in a
private place together with this nun, the one with the other. Those who were
modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the venerable Udāyin sit down in a private place together with a nun,
the one with the other?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Udāyin, sat down in a private place together
with a nun, the one with the other?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, sit down in a private place together with a nun, the
one with the other? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not
(yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should sit down in a private place together with a nun, the one
with the other, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… is monk to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Nun</span> means:
<span class="gloss">one ordained by both Orders.</span></p>

<span class="term">Together with</span> means:
<span class="gloss">together.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">The one with the other</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there is a monk and also a nun. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.69" href="#Vin.4.69"></a>
</span></p>
<p><span class="term">A private place</span> means:
<span class="gloss">private from the eye, private from the ear. Private from the eye means: if
covering the eye, or raising the eyebrow, or raising the head, he is unable to
see. Private from the ear means: it is impossible to hear ordinary talk (from
him and the woman).</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should sit down</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if a nun is sitting and a monk comes to be sitting or lying down close (to
her), there is an offence of expiation; if a monk is sitting and a nun comes to
be sitting or lying down close (to him), there is an offence of expiation. Or
if both are sitting or if both are lying down, there is an offence of
expiation.</span></p>

If he thinks that it is a private place when it is a private place (and) sits
down, the one with the other, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in
doubt as to whether it is a private place … If he thinks that it is not a
private place when it is a private place … is an offence of expiation. If he
thinks that it is a private place when it is not a private place, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is not a private
place, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not a
private place when it is not a private place, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.30.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.30.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if some learned friend comes to be (present); if he stands,
does not sit; if he is not desirous of a private place; if he sits down
thinking about something else; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
