… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
nuns asked a question of a monk who had not given leave. Monks … spread it
about, saying: “How can these nuns ask a question of a monk who has not given
leave?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks … <span class="add">see <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bi-vb-pc94#Bi-Pc.94.1">Bi-Pc.94.1</a></span> … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should ask a question of a monk who has not given leave, there is
an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Not given leave</span> means:
<span class="gloss">without asking (for permission).</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should ask a question</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if, having asked for leave in regard to Suttanta, she asks about Discipline or
about Abhidhamma, there is an offence of expiation. If, having asked for leave
in regard to Discipline, she asks about Suttanta or about Abhidhamma, there is
an offence of expiation. If, having asked for leave in regard to Abhidhamma,
she asks about Suttanta or about Discipline, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

There is no offence if she asks, having asked for leave; if having asked for
leave in general, she asks concerning whatever she likes; if she is mad, if she
is the first wrong-doer.</p>
