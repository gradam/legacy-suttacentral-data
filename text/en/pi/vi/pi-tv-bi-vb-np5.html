… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the nun Thullanandā came to be ill. Then a certain lay-follower approached the
nun Thullanandā; having approached, he spoke thus to the nun Thullanandā: “I
hope, lady, that you are better, I hope that you are keeping going.”</p>
<p>“Sir, I am not better, I am not keeping going.”</p>
<p>“Lady, I will deposit a <i lang="pi">kahāpaṇa</i> in the house of such and such a shopkeeper; you can have whatever you want
brought from there.”</p>
<p>The nun Thullanandā enjoined a certain probationer, saying: “Go, probationer,
fetch oil for the <i lang="pi">kahāpaṇa</i> from the house of such and such a shopkeeper.”</p>
<p>Then that probationer, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.250" href="#Vin.4.250"></a>
having for the <i lang="pi">kahāpaṇa</i> fetched oil from the house of that shopkeeper, gave it to the nun Thullanandā.
The nun Thullanandā said: “I do not need oil, probationer, I need ghee.” Then
that probationer approached that shopkeeper; having approached, she spoke thus
to that shopkeeper:</p>
<p>“The lady says that she does not need oil, sir, she needs ghee. You take the
oil (and) give me the ghee.”</p>
<p>“If we, lady, take back again goods that were bought, when will our goods be
sold? Oil was taken owing to the purchase of oil; give for the purchase of ghee
(and) you shall take ghee.”</p>
<p>Then that probationer stood crying. Nuns spoke thus to that probationer: “Why
are you crying, probationer?” Then that probationer told this matter to the
nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the lady Thullanandā, having got one thing in exchange, get another
thing in exchange?”</p>
