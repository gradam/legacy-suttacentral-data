… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
nuns for two years did not wait upon an ordained woman instructor. These were
ignorant, inexperienced, they did not know what was allowable or what was not
allowable. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these
nuns for two years not wait upon an ordained woman instructor?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns … woman instructor</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns … ordained woman instructor? It is not, monks, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.326" href="#Vin.4.326"></a>
</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun for two years should not wait upon an ordained woman instructor,
there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Ordained</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the <i lang="pi">upasampadā</i>, ordination conferred.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Woman instructor</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she is called a woman preceptor.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.378" href="#BD.3.378"></a>
<span class="term">Two years</span> means:
<span class="gloss">two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should not wait upon</span> means:
<span class="gloss">should not herself attend upon.</span></p>
<p>If she thinks: “I will not wait upon her for two years,” in throwing off the
responsibility, there is an offence of expiation.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.69.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.69.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if the woman preceptor is ignorant or shameless; if he is
ill; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
