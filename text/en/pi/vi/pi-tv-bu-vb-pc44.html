… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, having gone to the house of a
friend, sat down in a private place on a secluded seat together with his wife.
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.96" href="#Vin.4.96"></a>
Then that man looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can master Upananda sit down in a private place on a secluded seat
together with my wife?”</p>
<p>Monks heard that man who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, sit down in a private
place on a secluded seat together with a woman?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Upananda, sat down … with a woman?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, sit down … with a woman? Foolish man, it is not for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of
training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should sit down in a private place on a secluded seat together
with a woman, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

day, much more an older one.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Together with</span> means:
<span class="gloss">together.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">A private place</span> means:
<span class="gloss">private from the eye, private from the ear. Private from the eye means: if

whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should sit down</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if a woman is sitting and a monk comes to be sitting or lying down close (to
her), there is an offence of expiation; if a monk is sitting and a woman comes
to be sitting or lying down close (to him), there is an offence of expiation.
Or if both are sitting or if both are lying down, there is an offence of
expiation.</span></p>

If he thinks that it is a woman when it is a woman (and) sits down in a private
place on a secluded seat, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt
as to whether it is a woman … If he thinks that it is not a woman when it is a
woman … offence of expiation. If he sits down in a private place on a secluded
seat with a female <i lang="pi">yakkha</i> or with a female departed one or with a eunuch or with an animal in woman’s
form, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is a woman when
it is not a woman, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.97" href="#Vin.4.97"></a>
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is not a
woman, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not a woman
when it is not a woman, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.44.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.44.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if some learned friend comes to be (present); if he stands,
does not sit; if he is not desirous <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.359" href="#BD.2.359"></a>
of a private place; if he sits down thinking about something else; if he is
mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
