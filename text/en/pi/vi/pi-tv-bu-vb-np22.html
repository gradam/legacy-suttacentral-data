… among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan monastery. Now at that time
monks were invited by a certain potter who said: “If these masters need a bowl,
I (can supply them) with a bowl.” Now at that time monks, not knowing
moderation, asked for many bowls. They asked for large bowls for those who had
small bowls, they asked for small bowls for those who had large bowls. Then
that potter, making many bowls for the monks, could not make other goods for
sale, and he could not keep himself going and his wife and children suffered.
People … spread it about, saying: “How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans,
not knowing moderation, ask for many bowls? This (man), making many bowls for
these (monks), <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.245" href="#Vin.3.245"></a>
is not able to make other goods for sale, and he cannot keep himself going and
his wife and children suffer.”</p>
<p>Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying: “How can these monks, not knowing moderation, ask for
many bowls? Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Monks, is it true, as is said, that monks, not knowing moderation, asked for
many bowls?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can these foolish men, not knowing moderation, ask for many bowls?
It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …” <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.119" href="#BD.2.119"></a>
And having rebuked them and given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks,
saying:</p>
<p>“Monks, a bowl is not to be asked for. Whoever should ask (for one), there is
an offence of wrong-doing.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.22.1.2" href="#Bu-NP.22.1.2"></a>
Now at that time a certain monk’s bowl became broken. Then it occurred to that
monk: “Asking for a bowl is forbidden by the lord,” and being scrupulous; he
did not ask (for one); he went about for alms-food (to be put) into his hands.
People … spread it about, saying: “How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans,
go about for alms-food (to be put) into their hands, like followers of other
sects?” Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks told
this matter to the lord. Then the lord on this occasion, in this connection,
having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying: “I allow you, monks,
when a bowl is destroyed or when a bowl is broken, to ask for a bowl.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.22.1.3" href="#Bu-NP.22.1.3"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks said: “It is allowed by the lord to ask
for a bowl when a bowl is destroyed or when a bowl is broken”; and these,
because (their bowls) were a little broken and a little <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.120" href="#BD.2.120"></a>
chipped and a little scratched, asked for many bowls. Then that potter, making
many bowls, as before, for the monks, was not able to make other goods for
sale, and he did not keep himself going and his wife and children suffered. As
before, people … spread it about, saying: “How can these recluses, sons of the
Sakyans, not knowing moderation, ask for many bowls? This (man) making many
bowls for these (monks), is not able to make other goods for sale, and he does
not keep himself going and his wife and children suffer.” Monks heard these
people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks … spread it about,
saying: “How can this group of six monks, when their bowls are a little broken
and <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.246" href="#Vin.3.246"></a>
a little chipped and a little scratched, ask for many bowls?” Then these monks
told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, when your bowls were a little broken
… asked for many bowls?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, when your bowls are a little broken … ask for many
bowls? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not yet pleased … And
thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should get another new bowl in exchange for a bowl mended in less
than five places, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. That
bowl is to be forfeited by that monk to the company of monks, and whatever is
the last bowl belonging <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.121" href="#BD.2.121"></a>
to that company of monks, that should be given to this monk with the words:
‘Monk, this is a bowl for you; it should be kept until it breaks.’ That is the
proper course in this case.” </span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-NP.22.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.22.2.1" href="#Bu-NP.22.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… is monk to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">A bowl mended in less than five places</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is not mended, or it is mended in one (place), or it is mended in two
(places), or it is mended in three (places), or it is mended in four (places).
A bowl with no room for mends means: its rim is not two finger-lengths (in
breadth). A bowl with room for mends means: its rim is two finger-lengths (in
breadth).</span></p>
<p><span class="term">New bowl</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is so called with reference to the asking for (it).</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should get in exchange</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he asks for (it). There is an offence of wrong-doing in the action. It is to be
forfeited on acquisition. It should be forfeited in the midst of the Order. All
should come together taking each the bowl in his keeping. An inferior bowl
should not be in his keeping if he hopes, ‘I shall receive a costly bowl.’ If
an inferior bowl is in his keeping, and he hopes, ‘I shall receive a costly
bowl,’ there is an <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.122" href="#BD.2.122"></a>
offence of wrong-doing. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited. That monk,
approaching the Order, arranging his upper robe over one shoulder, honouring
the feet of the senior monks, sitting down on his haunches, saluting with
joined palms, should say: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, this bowl, got in exchange by me for a bowl mended in less than
five places, is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to the Order.’</span> Having forfeited it, the offence should be confessed. The offence should be
acknowledged by an experienced, competent monk. A monk endowed with five
qualities should be agreed upon as assigner of bowls: one who would not follow
a wrong course through desire, one who would not follow a wrong course through
hatred, one who would not follow a wrong course through stupidity, one who
would not follow a wrong course through fear, and one who would know what is
taken and what is not taken. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.247" href="#Vin.3.247"></a>
And thus, monks, should he be agreed upon. First, the monk is to be requested.
Having been requested, the Order should be informed by an experienced,
competent monk, saying: ‘Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. If it seems
right to the Order, the Order should agree upon the monk so and so as assigner
of bowls. This is the motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. The
Order agrees upon the monk so and so as assigner of bowls. If it is pleasing to
the venerable ones to agree upon the monk so and so as assigner of bowls, let
them be silent; if it is not pleasing, they should speak. The monk so and so is
agreed upon by the Order as assigner of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.123" href="#BD.2.123"></a>
bowls, and it is right … So do I understand.’ The monk agreed upon should make
the bowl pass. He should say to an elder: ‘Honoured sir, let the elder take the
bowl.’ If the elder takes it, the elder’s bowl should be passed to a second. He
should not take it out of regard for him. For whoever should not take it, there
is an offence of wrong-doing. It should not be made to pass to one who has what
is not a bowl. In this way the bowl should be made to pass down to the youngest
member of the Order.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Whatever is the last bowl belonging to that company of monks, that should be
given to this monk with the words : ‘Monk, this is a bowl for you; it should be
kept until it breaks’</span> means:
<span class="gloss">This bowl should not be laid aside by that monk in what is not the right place;
it should not be used for improper purposes; it should not be given <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.124" href="#BD.2.124"></a>
away with the words: ‘How can this bowl be lost or destroyed or broken?’ If it
is laid aside in the wrong place or used for improper purposes or given away,
there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">This is the proper course in this case</span> means:
<span class="gloss">this is the appropriate course in this case.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.22.2.2" href="#Bu-NP.22.2.2"></a>
If he gets an unmended bowl in exchange for an unmended bowl, there is an
offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he gets a bowl that is mended in
one place … in two places … in three places … in four places in exchange for an
unmended bowl, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he
gets an unmended bowl … a bowl that is mended in one place … in two places … in
three places … in four places in exchange for a bowl that is mended in one
place, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he gets an
unmended bowl … a bowl that is mended in one place … in two places … in three
places … in four places in exchange for a bowl that is mended in two places …
in three places … in four places, there is an offence of expiation involving
forfeiture.</p>
<p>If he gets a bowl with no room for mends in exchange for an unmended bowl,
there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he gets a bowl that
has room for one mend in exchange for an unmended bowl … If he gets a bowl that
has room for four mends in exchange for a bowl that is mended in four places,
there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.248" href="#Vin.3.248"></a>
</p>
<p>If he gets an unmended bowl in exchange for a bowl that has no room for mends,
there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture … If he gets a bowl
mended in four places in exchange for a bowl that has room for four mends,
there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.</p>
<p>If he gets a bowl with no room for mends in exchange for a bowl that has no
room for mends … If he gets <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.125" href="#BD.2.125"></a>
a bowl that has room for four mends in exchange for a bowl that has room for
four mends, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.</p>
<p>There is no offence if the bowl is destroyed, if the bowl is broken, if they
belong to relations, if they are invited, if it is for another, if it is by
means of his own property; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
