… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the nun Sundarīnanda was beautiful, good to look upon, charming. People, having
seen the nun Sundarīnanda in the refectory, were filled with desire (and) gave
the very best meals to the nun Sundarīnanda who was filled with desire. The nun
Sundarīnanda ate as much as she pleased; other nuns did not obtain as much as
expected. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the
lady Sundarīnanda, filled with desire, having accepted with her own hand from
the hand of a man who is filled with desire, solid food, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.233" href="#Vin.4.233"></a>
soft food, eat it, partake of it?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Sundarīnanda, filled with desire …
ate it, partook of it?’</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can the nun
Sundarīnanda, filled with desire, having accepted with her own hand … solid
food or soft food, eat it, partake of it? It is not, monks, for pleasing those
who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, filled with desire, having accepted with her own hand from the
hand of a man who is filled with desire, solid food or soft food, should eat it
or partake of it, that nun also has fallen into a matter that is an offence at
once, entailing a formal meeting of the Order involving being sent away.”</span></p>

<p><span class="term">Filled with desire</span> means:
<span class="gloss">infatuated, full of desire, physically in love with.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Man</span> means:
<span class="gloss">a human man, not a <i lang="pi">yakkha</i>, not a departed one, not an animal; he is learned, competent to be infatuated.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Solid food</span> means:
<span class="gloss">having set aside the five (kinds of) meals (and) water for cleansing the teeth,
the rest is called solid food.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Soft food</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the five kinds (of) meals: conjey, barley-meal, food made with flour, fish,
meat.</span></p>
<p>If, thinking, “I will eat, I will partake of,” she accepts, there is a grave
offence. For every mouthful there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of
the Order.</p>
<p><span class="term">She also</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she is so called in reference to the former.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Offence at once</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… therefore again it is called an offence entailing a formal meeting of the
Order.</span></p>

If she accepts water for cleansing the teeth, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</p>
<p>If one is filled with desire (and) she accepts, thinking, “I will eat, I will
partake of,” there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful, there is a
grave offence. If she accepts water for cleansing the teeth, there is an
offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>If both are filled with desire (and) thinking, “I will eat, I will partake of,”
she accepts from the hand of a <i lang="pi">yakkha</i> or of a departed one or of a eunuch or of an animal in human form, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful there is a grave offence. If she
accepts water for cleansing the teeth, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>If one is filled with desire (and) she accepts, thinking, “I will eat, I will
partake of,” there is an offence of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.197" href="#BD.3.197"></a>
wrong-doing. For every mouthful, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she
accepts water for cleansing the teeth, there is an offence of wrong-doing. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.234" href="#Vin.4.234"></a></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Ss.5.2.3" href="#Bi-Ss.5.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if neither comes to be filled with desire; if she accepts,
knowing, “He is not filled with desire”; if he is mad, if she is the first
wrong-doer.</p>
