… at Āḷavī in the chief shrine at Āḷavī. Now at that time the monks of Āḷavī, doing repairs, knowing that the water contained life, sprinkled grass and clay and had them sprinkled. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the monks of Āḷavī, knowing that the water contained life … and have them sprinkled?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord…</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, knowing that the water contained life … and had them sprinkled?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>
“How can you, foolish men, knowing that the water contained life … and have them sprinkled? <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.49" href="#Vin.4.49"></a>
It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p><span class="rule">“Whatever monk, knowing that the water contains life, should sprinkle grass or clay or should have them sprinkled, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="gloss">… is monk to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">He knows</span> means:
<span class="gloss">either he knows by himself or others tell him.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should sprinkle</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he himself sprinkles, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should have sprinkled</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he commands another, there is an offence of expiation. When once commanded, if he sprinkles many times, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

If he thinks that it contains life when it contains life, (and) sprinkles grass or clay or has them sprinkled, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether it contains life … has them sprinkled, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it does not contain life when it contains life … has them sprinkled, there is no offence. If he thinks that it contains life when it does not contain life, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it does not contain life, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it does not contain life when it does not contain life, there is no offence.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.20.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.20.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if it was unintentional, if he was not thinking, if he did not know; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
