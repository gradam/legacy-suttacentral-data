At that time the awakened one, the Lord was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta
Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time as many as thirty monks of
Pāvā, all forest-dwellers, all almsmen, all wearers of rag-robes, all wearers
of the three robes, going to Sāvatthī so as to see the Lord when the beginning
of the rains was approaching, were unable to reach Sāvatthī for the beginning
of the rains; they entered upon the rains on the way, at Sāketa. They spent the
rains in a state of longing, thinking: “The Lord is staying close to us, six <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> from here, but we are not getting a chance to see the Lord.”
</p>
<p>Then these monks having, after the lapse of three months, kept the rains, after
the Invitation had been carried out, while the god was raining, while waters
were gathering, while swamps <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.352" href="#BD.4.352"></a>
were forming, with drenched robes and in a state of weariness approached
Sāvatthī, the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery, the Lord; having
approached, having greeted the Lord, they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.7.1.2" href="#Kd.7.1.2"></a>
Now it is the custom for awakened ones, for Lords to exchange friendly
greetings with in-coming monks. So the Lord spoke thus to these monks:</p>
<p>“I hope, monks, that things went well with you, I hope you had enough to
support life, I hope that, in unity, being on friendly terms and harmonious,
you spent a comfortable rainy season and did not go short of almsfood?”</p>
<p>“Things did go well with us, Lord, we had enough to support life, Lord, and in
unity we, Lord, being on friendly terms and harmonious, spent the rainy season
and did not go short of almsfood. Here are we, Lord, as many as thirty monks of
Pāvā, coming to Sāvatthī so as to see the Lord, (but) when the beginning of the
rains was approaching, we were unable to reach Sāvatthī for the beginning of
the rains; we entered on the rains on the way, at Sāketa. We spent the rains,
Lord, in a state of longing for you, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.1.254" href="#Vin.1.254"></a>
thinking: ‘The Lord is staying close to us, six <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> from here, but we are not getting a chance to see the Lord.’ Then we, Lord,
having, after the lapse of three months, kept the rains, and after the
Invitation had been carried out, while the god was raining, while waters were
gathering, while swamps were forming, with drenched robes and in a state of
weariness came along on the journey.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.7.1.3" href="#Kd.7.1.3"></a>
Then the Lord, on this occasion, having given <i lang="pi"><i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk</i> addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to make up
<i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth when monks have completed the rains. Five (things) will be allowable to
you, monks, when the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloths have been made up: going
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.353" href="#BD.4.353"></a>
(to families for alms) without having asked for permission, walking (for alms)
not taking the three robes, a group-meal, a as many robes as you require, and
whatever robe-material accrues there, that will be for them. These five
(things) will be allowable to you, monks, when the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloths have been made.</span> And thus, monks, should <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth be made:</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.7.1.4" href="#Kd.7.1.4"></a>
“The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This material for
<i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth has accrued to the Order. If it seems right to the Order, the Order
should give this material for <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth to the monk so and so for making <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth. This is the motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This
material for <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth has accrued to the Order. The Order is giving this material for <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth to the monk so and so for making <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth. If the giving
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.354" href="#BD.4.354"></a>
of this material for <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth to the monk so and so for making <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth is pleasing to the venerable ones, let them be silent. He to whom it is
not pleasing should speak. This material for <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth is given by the Order to the monk so and so for making kathiṇa-cloth. It
is pleasing to the Order, therefore they are silent. Thus do I understand
this.</span>’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.7.1.5" href="#Kd.7.1.5"></a>
“Monks, <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth becomes made thus, not made thus.

And even if <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth comes to be quite properly made, but if no one gives thanks for it
standing outside the boundary, thus also <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth comes to be not made. And thus, monks, does <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth come to be not made.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.7.1.7" href="#Kd.7.1.7"></a>
“And how, monks, do the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges) become removed? Monks, there are these eight grounds for the
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.358" href="#BD.4.358"></a>
removal of the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges): that depending on (a monk) going away; that depending on (his
robe) being settled; that depending on his resolves (not to have it made up and
not to come back); that depending on (the robe) being lost; that depending on
his hearing (of the general removal of the privileges in the residence to which
he has gone); (that depending on) the disappointment of his expectation (that a
special gift of a robe would be made to him); that depending on his having
crossed the boundary; (that depending on) the removal (of the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> privileges) together with (those of the other monks)”.</p>

This item of <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth, and the five things called allowable:<br>
Without asking permission, nor taking three robes, <br>
a joint-meal likewise, /<br>
As much as is required, and one that accrues will be for the makers.<br>
The motion, and just what is made and just what is not made. /<br>
Marking, washing, and calculating, and cutting, tacking, <br>
making lengths, using a piece of cloth, and strengthening, braiding, /
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.1.266" href="#Vin.1.266"></a>

Binding, patching, dyeing, talk with hints, temporary, <br>
postponement, abandonment, <br>

Unsoiled, when what is allowable (is unsoiled), <br>
pieces of cloth, rags, and bits near a shop, / <br>
Not insinuation, nor roundabout talking, <br>
not temporary and no postponement,<br>
not abandoned, made allowable, <br>

His <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges) become removed depending on that of resolve.<br>
Taking robe-material he goes away, when he is outside the boundary, he thinks,
/<br>
“I will have it made up here, I will not come back,” but while it is being made
up, it is lost; <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.377" href="#BD.4.377"></a>
<br>
his <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges) become removed depending on that of loss. /<br>
Taking it, he goes away, thinking, “I will come back”, <br>
and has the robe-material made up
outside,<br>
when the robe has been made up, <br>
he hears that the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges) are removed there; /<br>
His <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges) become removed <br>
depending on that of hearing.<br>
Taking it, be goes away, thinking, “I will come back”, <br>
and has the robe-material made up outside, /<br>
When the robe has been made up, (staying) outside <br>
he does not go back <br>
until the removal of the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges); <br>
his <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges) become removed <br>
depending on that of having crossed the
boundary. /<br>
Taking it, he goes away, thinking, “I will come back”, <br>
and has the robe-material made up outside,<br>
when the robe has been made up, <br>
thinking, “I will come back”, <br>
(his return) coincides with
the removal of the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges); /<br>
The removal of his <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges) is because it occurs with (that of) the other monks. <br>
Taking and taking with him, the going away is seven times sevenfold. /<br>
There is no sixfold going away, <br>
(the robes) imperfectly executed depending on “going away”.<br>
Taking it, this arises, “I will have it made up <br>
when I am outside the boundary”; /<br>
Settled and resolves and loss, these three.<br>
Taking it, thinking, “I will not come back”, <br>
“I am making it up outside the boundary”; / <br>
Settled, then resolves, then loss, this is three (fold). <br>
Without having determined, for it does not (occur) to him, <br>
the threefold meaning below. /

<br>
Taking it, he goes away, thinking, “I will come back”, <br>
“I am making it up outside the boundary”, <br>
thinking, “I will not come back”, he gets it made up; <br>
his <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges) are removed <br>
because of (his robes) being settled. /<br>
Resolves and loss, hearing, having crossed the boundary,<br>
it may arise with (those of the other) monks; <br>
thus there is going away fifteen times. /<br>
Taking with him, imperfectly executed, <br>
taking it with him likewise again,<br>
these are four turns where all is fifteen-fold. /<br>
And contrary to expectation, in accordance with expectation, <br>
and business, these three.<br>
One should understand this from what has been said: there are three that are
each twelve (-fold). /<br>
Here are nine on “without collecting”, <br>
there is a set of five on comfort;<br>
impediments, non-impediments; <br>
the key is made from what has been said.
