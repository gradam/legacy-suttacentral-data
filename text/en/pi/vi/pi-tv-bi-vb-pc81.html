… at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding place. Now at that
time the nun Thullanandā thinking: “I will ordain a probationer,” having had
monks who were elders convened, having seen sumptuous solid foods and soft
foods, saying: “Masters, I will not ordain the probationer yet,” having
dismissed the monks who were elders, having had Devadatta, Kokālika,
Kaṭamorakatissaka, the son of the lady Khaṇḍā and Samuddadatta convened, she
ordained the probationer. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:
“How can the lady Thullanandā ordain a probationer by showing favouritism to
(monks) placed on probation?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā ordained a probationer
by showing favouritism to (monks) placed on probation?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can the nun
Thullanandā … (monks) placed on probation? It is not, monks, for pleasing those
who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should ordain a probationer by showing favouritism to (monks)
placed on probation, there is an offence of expiation.</span>”</p>

There is no offence if she ordains her if the company has not risen; if she is
mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
