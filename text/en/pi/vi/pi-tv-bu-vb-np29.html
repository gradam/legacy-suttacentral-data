… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
monks who had finished keeping the rains were staying in lodgings in the
jungles. Thieves (of the kind who attack monks in the month) of Kattika
attacked them, saying: “The monks have received possessions.” They told this
matter to the lord. Then the lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having
given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying: “I allow you, monks, when
staying in lodgings in the jungles, to lay aside one of the three robes inside
a house.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.29.1.2" href="#Bu-NP.29.1.2"></a>
Now at that time monks thought: “It is allowed by the lord when staying in
lodgings in the jungles <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.263" href="#Vin.3.263"></a>
to lay aside one of the three robes inside a house.” These, laying aside one of
the three robes inside a house, were away for more than six nights. These robes
were lost and destroyed and burnt and eaten by rats. The monks became badly
dressed, wearing shabby robes. (Other) monks spoke thus:</p>
<p>“How is it that you, your reverences, are badly dressed, wearing shabby robes?”
Then these monks told this matter to the monks. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can these monks, laying aside one of the three robes inside a house, be
away for more than six nights?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord.
He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that monks laying aside <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.157" href="#BD.2.157"></a>
one of the three robes inside a house were away for more than six nights?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can these foolish men, laying aside one of the three robes inside
a house, be away for more than six nights? It is not, monks, for pleasing those
who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be
set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Having spent the rains up to the full moon of Kattika, in case a monk who is
staying in such lodgings as those jungle lodgings which are held to be
dangerous and frightening, so desires, he may lay aside one of his three robes
inside a house; and should there be any reason for that monk to be away,
separated from that robe, that monk may be away, separated from that robe for
at most six nights. Should he be away, separated (from it) for longer than
that, except on the agreement of the monks, there is an offence of expiation
involving forfeiture.”</span></p>

<p><span class="term">The full moon of Kattika</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is called the (night of) Kattika-cātumāsinī.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Those jungle lodgings</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the last lodging called “jungle” is five hundred <i lang="pi">dhanu</i> measures (away from the village).</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.158" href="#BD.2.158"></a>
<span class="term">Dangerous</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if, in a monastery, in the precincts of a monastery, a place where thieves are

sitting down is seen, a place where they are lying down is seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Frightening</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if, in a monastery, in the precincts of a monastery, people injured by thieves
are seen, (people) plundered are seen, (people) beaten down are seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">In case a monk is staying in such lodgings</span> means:
<span class="gloss">a monk staying in lodgings like these. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.264" href="#Vin.3.264"></a>
</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Desires</span> means:
<span class="gloss">wanting.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">One of his three robes</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the outer cloak or the upper robe or the inner robe.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">May lay aside inside a house</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he may lay it aside in the neighbourhood in a food-village.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">And should there be any reason for that monk to be away, separated from that
robe</span> means:
<span class="gloss">should there be a reason, should there be (something) to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">That monk may be away, separated from that robe for at most six nights</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he may be away, separated (from it) for six nights at the maximum.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Except on the agreement of the monks</span> means:
<span class="gloss">setting aside the agreement of the monks.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should he be away, separated (from it) for longer than that</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is to be forfeited at sunrise on the seventh day. It should be forfeited to
… an individual. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, having been away, separated from this robe of mine, for more
than six nights, except on the agreement of the monks, it is to be forfeited. I
forfeit it to the Order.’</span> …
<span class="kamma">‘… the Order should give back … let the venerable ones give back … I will give
back this robe to the venerable one.’</span></span></p>
<p>If he thinks that it is more when it is more than six <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.159" href="#BD.2.159"></a>
nights, (and) is away, separated, except on the agreement of the monks, there
is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he is in doubt as to
whether it is more than six nights, and is away, separated, except on the
agreement of the monks, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.
If he thinks that it is less when it is more than six nights, (and) is away,
separated, except on the agreement of the monks, there is an offence of
expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that (the robe) is taken away when
it is not taken away … If he thinks that it is bestowed when it is not bestowed
… If he thinks that it is lost when it is not lost … If he thinks that it is
destroyed when it is not destroyed … If he thinks that it is burnt when it is
not burnt … If he thinks that it is stolen when it is not stolen, (and) is away
except on the agreement of the monks, there is an offence of expiation
involving forfeiture. Not forfeiting the robe which had to be forfeited, if he
makes use of it, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is
more, when it is less than six nights, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If
he is in doubt as to whether it is less than six nights, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is less when it is less than six nights,
there is no offence.</p>
<p>There is no offence if he is away, separated for six nights; if he is away,
separated for less than six nights; if, being away, separated for six nights,
entering the village-boundary and staying (there) he departs again; if, within
six nights, the (robe) is taken away, bestowed, lost, destroyed, burnt, if they
tear it from him, if they take it on trust; if there is the agreement of the
monks; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.265" href="#Vin.3.265"></a>
