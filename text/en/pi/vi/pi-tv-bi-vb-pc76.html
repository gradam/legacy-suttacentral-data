… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the nun Caṇḍakālī, having approached the Order of nuns, asked for the agreement
to ordain. Then the Order of nuns, having tested the nun Caṇḍakālī, saying:
“You have ordained sufficiently, lady, for the time being,” did not give her
the agreement to ordain. The nun Caṇḍakālī answered, “Very good.” Now at that
time the Order of nuns gave the agreement to ordain to other nuns. The nun
Caṇḍakālī … spread it about, saying: “Am I then ignorant, am I then
unconscientious, that the Order gives the agreement to ordain to other nuns,
but does not give it to me?” Those who were modest nuns … spread it about,
saying:</p>
<p>“How can the lady Caṇḍakālī, on being told, ‘You have ordained sufficiently,
lady, for the time being,’ and having answered, ‘Very good,’ afterwards engage
in criticism?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Caṇḍakālī … afterwards engaged in
criticism?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can the nun
Caṇḍakālī … afterwards engage in criticism? It is not, monks, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, on being told, ‘You have ordained <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.388" href="#BD.3.388"></a>
sufficiently, lady, for the time being,’ and having answered, ‘very good,’
should afterwards engage in criticism, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.76.2.1" href="#Bi-Pc.76.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">‘You have ordained sufficiently, lady, for the time being’</span> means:
<span class="gloss">‘You have conferred the <i lang="pi">upasampadā</i>, sufficiently, lady, for the time being.’</span></p>
<p>If, having answered, ‘Very good,’ she afterwards engages in criticism, there is
an offence of expiation.</p>

There is no offence if she criticises one acting by nature from desire, from
hatred, from confusion, from fear; if she is mad, if she is the first
wrong-doer. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.332" href="#Vin.4.332"></a></p>
