At one time the Awakened One, the Lord was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo
Grove at the squirrels’ feeding place. Now at that time the group of six monks,
while they were bathing, rubbed their bodies against a tree and their thighs
and their arms and their chests and their backs. People looked down upon,
criticised, spread it about saying: “How can these recluses, sons of the
Sakyans, while they are bathing, rub their bodies against a tree … and their
backs, like boxers and wrestlers and young villagers?” Monks heard these people
who were … spreading it about. Then these monks told this matter to the Lord.
Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of
monks convened, questioned the monks, saying: “Is it true, as is said, monks,
that the group of six monks … and their backs?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” The Awakened One, the Lord rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks, it is not suitable in these foolish men, it is not becoming, it is not
fitting, it is not worthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it is not to be
done. How, monks, can these foolish men, while they are bathing, rub their
bodies against a tree … and their backs? It is not, monks, for pleasing those
who are not (yet) pleased …” and having rebuked them, having given reasoned
talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, while a monk is bathing he should not rub his body against a tree.
Whoever should (so) rub it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>

saying: “What kind of sore have I, your reverences?” The monks <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.145" href="#BD.5.145"></a>
spoke thus: “The sore is of such and such a kind, your reverence.” He did not

Now at that time there was a festival on a mountain-top in Rājagaha. The group
of six monks went to see the festival on the mountain-top. People … spread it

sound.” Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it
about, saying: “How can this group of six monks sing <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> with a long-drawn plain-song sound?” Then these monks told this matter to the
Lord. He said: “Is it true, as is said …?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” … Having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks,
saying: “Monks, there are these five disadvantages to one singing <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> with a long-drawn plain-song sound: he is pleased with himself in regard to
that sound, and others are pleased in regard to that sound, and housepeople
look down upon, and while he is himself striving after accuracy in the sound
there is an interruption in his concentration, and people coming after fall
into the way of (wrong) views. These, monks, are the five disadvantages to one
singing <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> with a long-drawn plain-song sound.
<span class="rule">Monks, <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> should not be sung with a long-drawn plain-song sound. Whoever should (so)

<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.5.1" href="#Kd.15.5.1"></a>
Now at that time the mango trees in the park of King Seniya Bimbisāra of
Magadha were bearing fruit and it was made known by King Seniya Bimbisāra of
Magadha: “Let the masters make as much use of the mangoes as they please.” <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.147" href="#BD.5.147"></a>
The group of six monks, having made even young mangoes fall, made use of them.
And <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.109" href="#Vin.2.109"></a>
King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha wanted a mango. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of
Magadha enjoined people, saying: “Go, good sirs, having gone to the park, bring
back a mango.”</p>
<p>“Very well, your majesty,” and these people having answered King Seniya
Bimbisāra of Magadha in assent, having gone to the park, spoke thus to the park
keeper: “Good sir, his majesty wants a mango, give (us) a mango.”</p>
<p>“There is not a mango, masters; the monks having made even young mangoes fall,
have made use of them.” Then these people told this matter to King Seniya
Bimbisāra of Magadha. He said: “Good sirs, mangoes are much enjoyed by the
masters, yet it is moderation that the Lord extols.” People … spread it about,
saying: “How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, not knowing moderation,
make use of the king’s mangoes?” Monks heard these people who … spread it
about. Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, mangoes should not be made use of. Whoever should make use of them,
there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.5.2" href="#Kd.15.5.2"></a>
Now at that time a certain guild came to have food for an Order. Mango peels
were put into the curry. Monks, being scrupulous, did not accept. (The Lord
said:) “Accept it, monks, make use of it. <span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, mango peels.</span>” Now at that time a Certain guild came to have food for an Order. They did not
know how to prepare the peels; they walked into the refectory with the mangoes
whole. Monks, being scrupulous, did not accept. (The Lord said:) “Accept them,
monks, make use of them. <span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to make use of fruit that in five ways is allowable for
recluses: if it is damaged by fire, damaged by a knife, damaged by (one’s)
nail, if it is seedless, and the fifth is if the seeds are discharged. I allow
you, monks, to make use of fruit that in these five ways is allowable to
recluses.</span>”</p>

Now at that time a certain monk, bitten by a snake, passed away. They told this
matter to the lord. He said: “Monks, this monk certainly did not suffuse with
loving-kindness of mind the four royal snake families. For if, monks, this monk
had suffused with loving-kindness of mind the four royal snake families, then
this monk, although bitten by a snake, would not have passed away. What are the
four royal snake families? The royal snake family of Virūpakkha, the royal
snake family of Erāpatha, the royal snake family of Chabyāputta, the royal
snake family of Kaṇhāgotamaka. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.110" href="#Vin.2.110"></a>
Monks, this monk certainly did not suffuse with loving-kindness of mind these
four royal snake families. For if, monks, this monk had suffused with
loving-kindness of mind these four royal snake families, then this monk,
although bitten by a snake, would not have passed away. Monks, I allow you to

make a charm for the self for self-protection, for self-guarding. And thus,
monks, should it be made:</p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.7.1" href="#Kd.15.7.1"></a>
Now at that time a certain monk, tormented by dissatisfaction, cut off his own
male organ. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “This foolish man,
monks, cut off one thing when another should have been cut off. <span class="rule">Monks, one should not cut off one’s own male organ. Whoever should cut it off,

<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.8.1" href="#Kd.15.8.1"></a>
Now at that time a block of sandal-wood of costly choice sandal-wood had
accrued to a (great) merchant of Rājagaha. Then it occurred to this (great)
merchant of Rājagaha: “Suppose that I were to have a bowl carved out of this
block of sandal-wood? The chips will be for my enjoyment, and I can also give
away the bowl as a gift.” Then that (great) merchant of Rājagaha, having had a
bowl carved out of that block of sandal-wood, having put a string round it,
having hung it up on the top of a bamboo (-pole), having tied it to a series of
bamboo (-poles); spoke thus: “Let whatever recluse or brahmin who is a
perfected one as well as of psychic power get down this bowl and (to him) it is
given.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.111" href="#Vin.2.111"></a>
Then Pūraṇa
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.150" href="#BD.5.150"></a>
Kassapa approached the (great) merchant of Rājagaha; having approached, he
spoke thus to the (great) merchant of Rājagaha:</p>
<p>“Now I, householder, am a perfected one as well as of psychic power; give me
the bowl.”</p>
<p>“If, revered sir, the venerable one is a perfected one as well as of psychic
power, let him fetch down the bowl and it is given (to him.)”</p>
<p>Then Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesakambalin, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya
Belaṭṭhiputta, Nātaputta the Jain approached the (great) merchant of Rājagaha;
having approached … “… it is given (to him).”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time the venerable Moggallāna the Great and the venerable Piṇḍola
the Bhāradvāja, having dressed in the morning, taking (each) his bowl and robe,
entered Rājagaha for almsfood. Then the venerable Piṇḍola the Bhāradvāja spoke
thus to the venerable Moggallāna the Great:</p>
<p>“The venerable Moggallāna the Great is a perfected one as well as of psychic
power. Go along, reverend Moggallāna, fetch down this bowl; this bowl is for
you.”</p>
<p>“The venerable Piṇḍola the Bhāradvāja a perfected one as well as of psychic
power. Go along, reverend Bhāradvāja, fetch down this bowl; this bowl is for
you.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Piṇḍola the Bhāradvāja, having risen above the ground,
having taken hold of that bowl, circled three times round Rājagaha. Now at that
time, the (great) merchant of Rājagaha was standing with his wife and children
in his own dwelling holding up his joined palms in salutation, paying homage,
and saying: “Honoured sir, let master Bhāradvāja come to rest just here at our
dwelling.” Then the venerable Piṇḍola the Bhāradvāja came to rest at the
dwelling of the (great) merchant of Rājagaha. Then the (great) merchant of
Rājagaha, having taken the bowl from <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.151" href="#BD.5.151"></a>
the hand of the venerable Piṇḍola the Bhāradvāja, having filled it with costly
solid foods, bestowed it on the venerable Piṇḍola the Bhāradvāja. Then the
venerable Piṇḍola the Bhāradvāja, having taken hold of that bowl, went off to
the monastery.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.8.2" href="#Kd.15.8.2"></a>
People heard: “It is said that the bowl of the (great) merchant of Rājagaha was
fetched down by master Piṇḍola the Bhāradvāja,” and these people (making) a
loud noise, a great noise, followed close after the venerable Piṇḍola the
Bhāradvāja. Then the Lord heard the loud noise, the great noise, and having
heard it, he addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying: “What on earth, Ānanda, is
this loud noise, this great noise?”</p>
<p>“Lord, the bowl of the (great) merchant of Rājagaha has been fetched down by
the venerable Piṇḍola the Bhāradvāja. Lord, people heard: ‘It is said that the
bowl of the (great) merchant of Rājagaha was fetched down by the venerable
Piṇḍola the Bhāradvāja, and, Lord, these people (making) a loud noise, a great
noise, have followed close after the venerable Piṇḍola the Bhāradvāja’; this,
Lord, is the loud noise, the great noise which the Lord (hears).”</p>
<p>Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of
monks convened, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.112" href="#Vin.2.112"></a>
questioned the venerable Piṇḍola the Bhāradvāja, saying:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, Bhāradvāja, that the bowl of the (great) merchant of
Rājagaha was fetched down by you?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” The Awakened one, the Lord rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“It is not suiting, Bhāradvāja, it is not becoming, it is not fitting, it is
not worthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it is not to be done. How can
you, Bhāradvāja, on account of a wretched wooden bowl exhibit a condition of
further-men, a wonder of psychic power to householders? As, Bhāradvāja, a woman
exhibits her loin-cloth on account of a wretched stamped <i lang="pi">māsaka</i>, even so by you, Bhāradvāja, was a condition of further-men, a wonder of
psychic power exhibited to householders on account of a wretched wooden bowl.
It is not, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.152" href="#BD.5.152"></a>
Bhāradvāja, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …” Having rebuked him,
having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“
<span class="rule">Monks, a condition of further-men, a wonder of psychic power is not to be
exhibited to householders. Whoever should exhibit them, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</span> Break, monks, this wooden bowl; having reduced it to fragments, give them to

<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.9.1" href="#Kd.15.9.1"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks used various kinds of bowls, made of
gold, made of silver. People … spread it about, saying: “Like householders who
enjoy pleasures of the senses.” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“

Now at that time the bases of the bowls were rubbed. They told this matter to

<hr>
<p>Now at that time the group of six monks used various kinds of circular
bowl-rests, made of gold, made of silver. People … spread it about, saying:

Now at that time monks, sewing robes, pricked their fingers; their fingers

Now at that time as monks were sewing robes in the open air they were bothered
by cold and heat. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a hall for the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-frame, a hut for the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-frame.</span>” A hall for the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-frame was low to the ground, it was flooded by water.

Now at that time monks, having sewn robe-material, went away having left the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-frame at that very place, and it was eaten by rats and white ants. They told
this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to fold up the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-frame.</span>” A <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-frame was split. “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to fold up the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-frame by using a wooden rod.</span>” A <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-frame was twisted out of position. “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a cord for tying it.</span>” Now at that time monks, having lifted up the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-frame on to walls and posts, went away and the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-frame, having fallen down, was split.

Then the Lord having stayed in Rājagaha for as long as he found suiting set out
on tour for Vesālī. Now at that time <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.118" href="#Vin.2.118"></a>
the monks went along (each) taking his needle and small knife and medicine in

<hr>
<p>Now at that time a certain monk, having tied his sandals to his girdle entered
a village for almsfood. A certain lay-follower, greeting that monk, knocked up
against the sandals with his head. That monk became ashamed. Then that monk,
having arrived at a monastery, told this matter to the monks. The monks told
this matter to the Lord. He said: <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.162" href="#BD.5.162"></a>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.13.1" href="#Kd.15.13.1"></a>
Now at that time on a certain road there was water that was not allowable (for)
there was no strainer. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a strainer.</span>” A little piece of cloth was not enough. “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a strainer on a ladle.</span>” The little piece of cloth was not enough.

<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.13.2" href="#Kd.15.13.2"></a>
Now at that time two monks were going along a high road in the Kosalan country.
Ore monk indulged in bad habits. The other monk spoke thus to that monk: “Do
not do that, your reverence, it is not allowable.” He grumbled at him. Then
that monk, tormented by thirst, spoke thus to the monk who had grumbled: “Give
me the strainer, your reverence, I will drink (some) water.” The monk who had
grumbled did not give it. That monk passed away, tormented by thirst. Then that
monk, having arrived at a monastery, told this matter to the monks. They said:
“But did you, your reverence, (although) being asked, not give a strainer?”</p>
<p>“No, your reverences.” Those who were modest monks looked down upon,
criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can this monk, when being asked for a
strainer, not give it?” Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. Then the
Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of monks
convened, questioned this monk, saying:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monk, when being asked for a strainer, did
not give it?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” The enlightened one, the Lord rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“It is not suitable in you, foolish man, it is not becoming, it is not fitting,
it is not worthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.163" href="#BD.5.163"></a>
it is not to be done. How can you, foolish man, when being asked for a
strainer, not give it? It is not, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.119" href="#Vin.2.119"></a>
foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …” Having rebuked
him, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“
<span class="rule">Monks, if a monk is going along a highroad and is being asked for a strainer,
he should not not give it. Whoever should not give it, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="rule">Nor, monks, should you go along a highway without a strainer. Whoever should
(so) go, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span> If there is not a strainer nor a regulation water-pot, then a corner of the

having strained it with this’.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.13.3" href="#Kd.15.13.3"></a>
Then the Lord, walking on tour gradually arrived at Vesālī. The Lord stayed
there in Vesālī in the Great Grove at the Hall of the Gabled Pillars. Now at
that time monks were making repairs. The water-strainer did not cease (to be in
use). They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a double water-strainer.</span>” The double water-strainer did not cease (to be in use). They told this matter
to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a filter.</span>” Now at that time monks were pestered by mosquitoes. They told this matter to
the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a mosquito-net.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.15.14"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.14.1" href="#Kd.15.14.1"></a>
Now at that time at Vesālī a succession of meals of sumptuous foods came to be
arranged. Monks, having eaten the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.164" href="#BD.5.164"></a>
sumptuous foods, became very ill with their bodies full of (bad) humours. Then
Jīvaka Komārabhacca went to Vesālī on some business or other. Jīvaka
Komārabhacca saw the monks who were very ill with their bodies full of (bad)
humours; seeing them, he approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted
the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a
respectful distance, Jīvaka Komārabhacca spoke thus to the Lord:</p>
<p>“At present, Lord, monks are very ill with their bodies full of (bad) humours.
It were well, Lord, if the Lord allowed the monks a place for pacing up and
down in and a bathroom. Thus will the monks come to have few afflictions.” Then
the Lord gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted Jīvaka Komārabhacca with talk
on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, gladdened … delighted by the Lord with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, rising from his seat, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping his right
side towards him. Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having
given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a place for pacing up and down in, and a bathroom.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.14.2" href="#Kd.15.14.2"></a>
Now at that time
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.120" href="#Vin.2.120"></a>
monks paced up and down in an uneven place for pacing up and down in; their
feet became painful. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to make it level.</span>” A place for pacing up and down in was low to the ground; it was flooded by

<hr>
<p>Now at that time, monks, as they were pacing up and down in the place for
pacing up and down in, fell off. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “
<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a railing round the place for pacing up and down in.</span>” Now at that time monks, pacing up and down in the open air, were bothered

<p>The lower part of the lath and plaster wall of a bathroom decayed. They told
this matter to the Lord. He said: “ <span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to make a facing (round it).</span>” The

<p>Now at that time monks made a fireplace in the middle of a small bathroom, and
there was no access. “ <span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to make a fireplace at one side of a small bathroom, in the
middle of a large one.</span>” The fire in the bathroom scorched their faces. “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, clay for the face.</span>” They moistened the clay with their hands. “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a tub for the clay.</span>” The clay came to smell nasty. “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to cure it.</span>” The fire in the bathroom scorched their bodies. “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to take in water.</span>” They took in water in dishes and bowls. “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a receptacle for water, a saucer for the water.</span>” A bathroom with a grass roofing did not make them sweat. “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, having lashed on (a roof), to give it a smearing inside and

on the ground in a bathroom and they got pins and needles in their limbs. “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a chair for the bathroom.</span>” Now at that time a bathroom was not fenced in. “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, three (kinds of) fences to fence it in with: a fence of bricks,

others who were naked to greet them; did a service to others who were naked and
made others do a service to those who were naked; while naked they gave to

Now at that time monks laid aside their robes on the ground in a bathroom; the
robes became soiled with dust. They <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.168" href="#BD.5.168"></a>
told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a bamboo for robes, a cord for robes.</span>” When it rained the robes got wet. “<span class="allowance">I allow, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.122" href="#Vin.2.122"></a>

Now at that time monks were doubtful about doing a service both when in a

covering to the water, a covering by clothes.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time there was no water in a bathroom. They told this matter to the

<p>Now at that time monks, drawing water in the open air, were bothered by cold

Now at that time monks bathed here, there and everywhere in a monastery; the
monastery became swampy. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a pool.</span>” The pool was public. “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, three (kinds of) fences to fence it in: a fence of bricks, a

Now at that time the group of six monks were away, separated from their pieces
of cloth to sit upon for four months. They told this matter to the Lord. He
said: “<span class="rule">Monks, you should not be away, separated from your pieces of cloth to sit upon
for four months. Whoever should be (so) away, separated from, there is an
offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>

<p>Now at that time the group of six monks lay down to sleep on beds which were
scattered over with flowers. People, touring the dwelling-place, having seen
them … spread it about, saying: “Like householders who enjoy pleasures of the

<p>Now at that time people, taking scents and garlands, came to a monastery. Monks
being scrupulous, did not accept them. They told this matter to the Lord. He

it be assigned?” “<span class="allowance">A piece of felt, monks, should be neither allotted nor assigned.</span>”</p>

Now at that time the Licchavi Vaḍḍha was a friend of the monks who were
followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka. Then the Licchavi Vaḍḍha approached the
monks who were followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka; having approached, he spoke
thus to the monks who were followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka: “I salute you,
masters.” When he had spoken thus, the monks who were followers of Mettiya and
Bhummajaka did not respond. And a second time … And a third <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.172" href="#BD.5.172"></a>
time did the Licchavi Vaḍḍha speak thus to the monks who were followers of
Mettiya and Bhummajaka: “I salute you, masters.” And a third time the monks who
were followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka did not respond. He said: “Do I offend
against the masters? Why do the masters not respond to me?”</p>
<p>“It is because you, friend Vaḍḍha, were indifferent when we were being molested
by Dabba the Mallian.”</p>
<p>“What can I, masters, do?”</p>
<p>“If you, friend Vaḍḍha, were willing you could get the Lord to expel the
venerable Dabba the Mallian this very day.”</p>
<p>“What can I, masters, do? How am I able to do that?”</p>
<p>“Come you, friend Vaḍḍha, go up to the Lord; having gone up, speak thus to the
Lord: ‘This, Lord, is not suitable, it is not becoming that this quarter which
should be without fear, secure, without danger, is the very quarter which is
full of fear, insecure, full of danger. Where there was a calm, now there is a
gale. It seems as if the very water is blazing. My wife has been seduced by
master Dabba the Mallian.’”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.20.2" href="#Kd.15.20.2"></a>
“Very well, masters,” and the Licchavi Vaḍḍha, having answered the monks who
were followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka in assent, approached the Lord; having
approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As
he was sitting down at a respectful distance <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.125" href="#Vin.2.125"></a>
, the Licchavi Vaḍḍha spoke thus to the Lord: “This, Lord, is not suitable … My
wife has been seduced by master Dabba the Mallian.”</p>
<p>Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of
monks convened, questioned the venerable Dabba the Mallian, saying: “Dabba, do
you remember doing as this Vaḍḍha says?”</p>
<p>“Lord, the Lord knows in regard to me.” And a second time the Lord … And a
third time the Lord spoke thus to the venerable Dabba the Mallian: “Dabba, do
you remember doing as this Vaḍḍha says?”</p>
<p>“Lord, the Lord knows in regard to me,” he said.</p>
<p>“Dabba, the Dabbas do not give evasive answers thus. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.173" href="#BD.5.173"></a>
If what was done was done by you, say so: if it was not done by you, say it was
not.”</p>
<p>“Lord, since I was born I cannot call to mind indulging in sexual intercourse
even in a dream; much less so when I was awake.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.20.3" href="#Kd.15.20.3"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: “Because of this, monks, let the
Order turn the Licchavi Vaḍḍha’s bowl upside down, let it impose non-eating
with the Order. Monks, if a lay-follower is possessed of eight qualities his
bowl may be turned upside down: if he tries for non-receiving (of gains) by
monks, if he tries for non-profiting by monks, if he tries for non-residence
for monks, if he reviles and abuses monks, if he causes monk to break with
monk, if he speaks dispraise of the Awakened One, if he speaks dispraise of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, if he speaks dispraise of the Order. I allow you, monks, to turn a
lay-follower’s bowl upside down if he is possessed of these eight qualities.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.20.4" href="#Kd.15.20.4"></a>
And thus, monks, should it be turned upside down: The Order should be informed
by an experienced, competent monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. The Licchavi Vaḍḍha is defaming the
venerable Dabba the Mallian with an unfounded charge of falling away from moral
habit. If it seems right to the Order, the Order may turn the Licchavi Vaḍḍha’s
bowl upside down, it may impose non-eating with the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.174" href="#BD.5.174"></a>
Order This is the motion Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. The
Licchavi Vaḍḍha is defaming … of falling away from moral habit. The Order is
turning the Licchavi Vaḍḍha’s bowl upside down, it is imposing non-eating with
an Order. If the turning upside down of the Licchavi Vaḍḍha’s bowl and the
imposing of non-eating with the Order is pleasing to the venerable ones they
should be silent; he to whom it is not pleasing, should speak. The Licchavi
Vaḍḍha’s bowl is turned upside down by the Order (and there is to be)
non-eating with the Order. It is pleasing to the Order; therefore it is silent.
Thus do I understand this.</span>’”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.20.5" href="#Kd.15.20.5"></a>
Then the venerable Ānanda, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and
robe, went up to the Licchavi Vaḍḍha’s dwelling; having gone up, he spoke thus
to the Licchavi Vaḍḍha: “Your bowl, friend Vaḍḍha, is turned upside down by an
Order, you are non-eating with the Order.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.126" href="#Vin.2.126"></a>
Then the Licchavi Vaḍḍha, thinking: “It is said that my bowl is turned upside
down by an Order, it is said that I am non-eating with the Order,” fainted and
fell on that very spot. Then the Licchavi Vaḍḍha’s friends and intimates, his
kith and kin spoke thus to the Licchavi Vaḍḍha:</p>
<p>“Enough, Vaḍḍha, do not grieve, do not lament, we will reconcile the Lord and
the Order of monks.” Then the Licchavi Vaḍḍha with his wife and children, with
his friends and intimates, with his kith and kin, his clothes wet, his hair wet
approached the Lord; having approached, he spoke thus to the Lord:</p>
<p>“Lord, a transgression has overcome me, in that I, foolish, misguided, wrong
that I was, defamed master Dabba the Mallian with an unfounded charge of
falling away from moral habit. For this, Lord, let the Lord acknowledge my
transgression as a transgression for the sake of restraint in the future.”</p>
<p>“Truly a transgression overcame you, friend Vaḍḍha, in that you, foolish,
misguided, wrong that you were, defamed Dabba the Mallian with an unfounded
charge of falling away <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.175" href="#BD.5.175"></a>
from moral habit. But if you, friend Vaḍḍha, having seen the transgression as a
transgression, confess according to the rule, we acknowledge it for you. For,
friend Vaḍḍha, in the discipline of the noble, this is growth: whoever having
seen a transgression as a transgression, confesses it according to the rule, he
attains restraint in the future.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.20.6" href="#Kd.15.20.6"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: “Well, now monks, let the Order set
upright the Licchavi Vaḍḍha’s bowl, let it grant eating with the Order. Monks,
if a lay-follower is possessed of eight qualities his bowl may be set upright:
if he does not try for non-receiving (of gains) by monks, if he does not try
for non-profiting by monks, if he does not try for non-residence for monks, if
he does not revile and abuse monks, if he does not cause monk to break with
monk, if he does not speak dispraise of the Awakened One, if he does not speak
dispraise of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, if he does not speak dispraise of the Order. I allow you, monks, to set
upright a lay-follower’s bowl if he is possessed of these eight qualities.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.20.7" href="#Kd.15.20.7"></a>
“And thus, monks, should it be set upright: Monks, that Licchavi Vaḍḍha, having
approached the Order, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, having
honoured the monks’ feet, having sat down on his haunches, having saluted them
with joined palms, should speak thus to them: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, my bowl was turned upside down by the Order, I am not eating
with the Order. But I, honoured sirs, am conducting myself properly, I am
subdued, I am mending my ways, and I ask the Order for the setting upright of
the bowl.</span>’ And a second time it should be asked for. And a third time it should be asked
for. The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.127" href="#Vin.2.127"></a>
‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. The Licchavi Vaḍḍha’s bowl was
turned upside down by the Order, he is not eating with the Order; but he is
conducting himself properly, he is subdued, he is mending his ways; he asks the
Order for the setting upright of the bowl. If it seems right to the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.176" href="#BD.5.176"></a>
Order, the Order may set upright the Licchavi Vaḍḍha’s bowl, it may grant
eating with the Order. This is the motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen
to me. The Licchavi Vaḍḍha’s bowl was turned upside down … he asks the Order
for setting upright the bowl. The Order is setting upright the Licchavi
Vaḍḍha’s bowl, it is granting eating with the Order. If the setting upright of
the Licchavi Vaḍḍha’s bowl and the granting of eating with the Order is
pleasing to the venerable ones, they should be silent; he to whom it is not
pleasing should speak. The Licchavi Vaḍḍha’s bowl is set upright by the Order
(and there is) eating with the Order. It is pleasing to the Order; therefore it
is silent. Thus do I understand this.</span>’”</p>

Then the Lord, having stayed in Vesālī for as long as he found suiting, set out
on tour for the Bhaggas. In due course, walking on tour, the Lord arrived at
the Bhaggas. The Lord stayed there among the Bhaggas on Suṁsumāra Hill in the
Bhesakaḷā Grove in the deer park. Now at that time Kokanada was the name of
Prince Bodhi’s palace; it had not long been built and was as yet uninhabited by
recluse or brahmin or by any human creature. Then Prince Bodhi addressed the
brahmin youth, the son of Sañjikā, saying: “Come along, good son of Sañjikā, go
up to the Lord; having gone up, in my name salute the Lord’s feet with your
head, ask whether he is well, not indisposed, of bodily vigour, strong, abiding
in comfort, and say: ‘Lord, Prince Bodhi salutes the Lord’s feet with his head
and asks whether he is well … abiding in comfort,’ and says this: ‘Lord, may
the Lord consent to a meal with Prince Bodhi tomorrow together with the Order
of monks.’”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.177" href="#BD.5.177"></a>
“Very well, good sir,” and the brahmin youth, Sañjikā’s son, having answered
Prince Bodhi in assent, approached the Lord; having approached, having
exchanged greetings with the Lord, having conversed in a courteous and friendly
way, sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful
distance the brahmin youth, the son of Sanjika, spoke thus to the Lord: “Prince
Bodhi salutes the revered Gotama’s feet with his head … and says may the
revered Gotama consent to a meal with Prince Bodhi tomorrow together with the
Order of monks.” The Lord consented by becoming silent.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.21.2" href="#Kd.15.21.2"></a>
Then the brahmin youth, Sañjikā’s son, having understood the Lord’s consent,
rising from his seat approached Prince Bodhi; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.128" href="#Vin.2.128"></a>
having approached, he spoke thus to Prince Bodhi: “I spoke, good sir, in your
name to the Lord Gotama, saying: ‘Prince Bodhi salutes … together with the
Order of monks.’ And the recluse Gotama consented.” Then Prince Bodhi towards
the end of that night, having had sumptuous foods, solid and soft, prepared,
and having had Kokanada palace strewn with white cloths as far as the last
flight of stairs, spoke thus to the brahmin youth, the son of Sañjikā: “Come
you along, good fellow, approach the Lord; having approached, announce the time
to the Lord, saying: ‘It is time, Lord, the meal is ready.’”</p>
<p>“Very well, good sir,” and the brahmin youth, Sañjikā’s son, having answered
Prince Bodhi in assent, approached the Lord; having approached, he announced
the time to the Lord, saying: “It is time, good Gotama, the meal is ready.”
Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe,
approached Prince Bodhi’s dwelling. Now at the time when the Lord was coming
Prince Bodhi was standing at the porch of the outside gateway. Prince Bodhi saw
the Lord coming in the distance, and seeing him, having gone from there to meet
him, having greeted the Lord, having honoured him, he approached Kokanada
palace. Then the Lord stood still at the last flight of stairs. Then Prince
Bodhi spoke thus to the Lord:</p>
<p>“Lord, let the Lord tread on the cloths, let the well-farer <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.178" href="#BD.5.178"></a>
tread on the cloths so that it may be for a long time for my blessing and
happiness.” When he had spoken thus the Lord became silent. And a second time …
And a third time Prince Bodhi spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, let the Lord tread
on … for my blessing and happiness.” Then the Lord looked towards the venerable
Ānanda. Then the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to Prince Bodhi:</p>
<p>“Let the cloths, prince, be packed away, the Lord will not tread upon the cloth
carpeting, the Truth-finder has compassion for the folk who come after.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.21.3" href="#Kd.15.21.3"></a>
Then Prince Bodhi, having had the cloths packed away, had a seat made ready
upstairs in Kokanada. Then the Lord having ascended the Kokanada palace, sat
down together with the Order of monks on the seat made ready. Then Prince
Bodhi, having with his own hand served and satisfied with sumptuous foods,
solid and soft, the Order of monks with the Awakened One at its head, when the
Lord had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl, sat down at a
respectful distance. Then the Lord, having gladdened, rejoiced, roused,
delighted Prince Bodhi as he was sitting at a respectful distance with talk on
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i>,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.129" href="#Vin.2.129"></a>
rising from his seat, departed. Then the Lord on this occasion, in this
connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying: “<span class="rule">Monks, you should not tread on a cloth carpeting. Whoever should tread on one,
there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.21.4" href="#Kd.15.21.4"></a>
Now at that time a certain woman who had had a miscarriage, having invited
monks, having had cloth prepared, spoke thus: “Revered sirs, tread on the
cloth.” The monks, being scrupulous, did not tread on it. She said: “Revered <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.179" href="#BD.5.179"></a>
sirs, tread on the cloth for good luck’s sake.” The monks, being scrupulous,
did not tread on it. Then that woman spread it about, saying: “How can these
masters (although) being asked for good luck’s sake not tread on the cloth
carpeting?” Monks heard this woman who … spread it about. Then these monks told
this matter to the Lord. He said: “Householders, monks, look out for lucky
signs. <span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, when being asked by householders for good luck’s sake, to
tread on a cloth carpeting.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time monks were doubtful whether to tread on a sheet for use after
feet had been washed. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you; monks, to tread on a sheet for use after feet have been washed.</span>”</p>
<p class="end">The Second Portion for Repeating</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.15.22"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.22.1" href="#Kd.15.22.1"></a>
Then the Lord having stayed among the Bhaggas for as long as he found suiting
set out on tour for Sāvatthī. Walking on tour in due course he arrived at
Sāvatthī. The Lord stayed there at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in
Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, taking a small jar
and a (clay foot-) scrubber and a broom, approached the Lord; having
approached, having greeted the Lord, she sat down at a respectful distance. As
she was sitting down at a respectful distance, Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, spoke
thus to the Lord: “Lord, may the Lord accept my little jar and (clay foot-)
scrubber and broom so that it may be for a long time for my blessing and
happiness.” The Lord accepted the little jar and the broom; the Lord did not
accept the (clay foot-) scrubber. Then the Lord gladdened, rejoiced, roused,
delighted Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Then
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.180" href="#BD.5.180"></a>
Visākhā, Migāra’s mother gladdened … delighted by the Lord with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, rising from her seat, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping her right
side towards him. Then <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.130" href="#Vin.2.130"></a>
the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk,
addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“
<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a little jar and a broom.</span>
<span class="rule">Monks, you should not make use of a (clay foot-) scrubber. Whoever should make
use of one, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, three (kinds of) foot-rubbers: a stone, a pebble, sea-scum.</span>”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.22.2" href="#Kd.15.22.2"></a>
Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, taking a fan and a palmyra-whisk, approached the
Lord … <span class="add">
<em>as in</em>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.23.1" href="#Kd.15.23.1"></a>
Now at that time a mosquito-fan accrued to an Order. They told this matter to
the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a mosquito-fan.</span>” A chowry-fan accrued. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, a chowry-fan should not be used. Whoever should use one, there is an
offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, three (kinds of) fans: made of bark, made of khus-khus, made of

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.23.2" href="#Kd.15.23.2"></a>
Now at that time a sunshade accrued to an Order. They told this matter to the
Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.181" href="#BD.5.181"></a>
sunshade.</span>”</p>
<p>Now at that time the group of six monks toured about having put up their
sunshades. Now at that time a certain lay-follower went to a pleasure grove
together with several disciples of Naked Ascetics. These disciples of Naked
Ascetics saw the group of six monks coming in the distance with their sunshades
up; seeing them, they spoke thus to that lay-follower: “These revered sirs of
yours, master, are coming along with their sunshades up like a group of chief
ministers.”</p>
<p>“These, masters, are not monks, they are wanderers.” They made a bet as to
whether they were monks or not. Then that lay-follower, having recognised them
as they came up, looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How
can these revered sirs <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.131" href="#Vin.2.131"></a>
tour about with their sunshades up?” Monks heard that lay-follower who … spread
it about. Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Is it true,
as is said, monks, …?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he
addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, a sunshade should not be used. Whoever should use one, there is an

<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.23.3" href="#Kd.15.23.3"></a>
Now at that time a certain monk came to be ill; there came to be no comfort for
him without a sunshade. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a sunshade to one who is ill.</span>” Now at that time monks, thinking: “A sunshade is allowed by the Lord to one
who is ill, but not to one who is not ill,” were doubtful whether to use a
sunshade in the monastery and monastery precincts. They told this matter to the
Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a sunshade to be used in a monastery and monastery precincts
both by one who is ill and by one who is not ill.</span>”</p>

Now at that time a certain monk, having tied up his bowl with string, having
hung it on his walking staff, passed at the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.182" href="#BD.5.182"></a>
wrong time through a certain village gateway. People, saying: “This, masters,
is a thief who is coming, his sword is gleaming,” having followed him and
seized him, let him go on recognising him. Then this monk, having gone back to
the monastery, told this matter to the monks.</p>
<p>“But did you, your reverence, carry a walking staff with string on it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, your reverences.” Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:
“How can this monk carry a walking staff with string on it?” Then these monks
told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Is it true, as is said, monks, …?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he
addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.24.2" href="#Kd.15.24.2"></a>
Now at that time a certain monk came to be ill; he was not able to tour about
without a walking staff. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to give an agreement as to a walking staff to a monk who
is ill. And thus, monks, should it be given: That ill monk, having approached
the Order, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, having honoured
the feet of the senior monks, having sat down on his haunches, having saluted
with joined palms, should speak thus to it: ‘<span class="kamma">I, honoured sirs, am ill; I am not able to tour about without a walking staff,
so I, honoured sirs, ask the Order for the agreement as to a walking staff.’
And a second time it should be asked for. And a third time it should be asked
for. The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.132" href="#Vin.2.132"></a>
‘Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This monk So-and-so is ill; he is
not able to tour about without a walking staff; he asks the Order for the
agreement as to a walking staff. If it seems right to the Order, the Order may
give the agreement as to a walking staff to the monk So-and-so. This is the
motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.183" href="#BD.5.183"></a>
This monk … as to a walking staff. The Order is giving the monk So-and-so the
agreement as to a walking staff. If the giving to the monk So-and-so of the
agreement as to a walking staff is pleasing to the venerable ones, they should
be silent; he to whom it is not pleasing should speak. The agreement as to a
walking staff is given by the Order to the monk So-and-so. It is pleasing to
the Order; therefore it is silent. Thus do I understand this.</span>’”</p>

Now at that time a certain monk came to be ill; he was not able to carry his

Now at that time a certain monk was a ruminator; he ate ruminating continually.
Monks … spread it about, saying: “This monk is partaking of a meal at the wrong
time.” Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Monks, this monk has recently passed on from the womb of a cow.
<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, rumination for a ruminator.</span>
<span class="rule">But, monks, one should not eat (anything), having brought it back from the

Now at that time a certain guild had food for an Order; many heaps of boiled
rice were allowed to fall in a refectory. People … spread it about, saying:
“How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, on being given boiled rice, not
accept it carefully? Each one of these heaps of boiled rice is the result of a
hundredfold labour.” Monks <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.133" href="#Vin.2.133"></a>
heard these people … who spread it about. Then these monks told this matter to
the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, if anything falls that is being given to you, to make use
of it having picked it up yourselves, for it is left behind (for you), monks,
by benefactors.</span>”</p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.27.1" href="#Kd.15.27.1"></a>
Now at that time a certain monk walked for almsfood with long (finger-) nails.
A certain woman, having seen him, spoke thus to that monk: “Come, honoured sir,
indulge in sexual intercourse.”</p>
<p>“No, sister, that is not allowable.”</p>
<p>“If you do not, honoured sir, I will now, having scratched my limbs with my own
nails, make a row, saying, ‘this monk has maltreated me.”</p>
<p>“You, sister, understand that.” Then that woman, having scratched her limbs
with her own nails, made a row, saying, “This monk has maltreated me.” People,
having run up, took hold of that monk. But these people saw skin and blood on
that woman’s nails; seeing this, they said: “This is the work of this woman
herself, the monk is innocent,” and they let go of that monk. Then that monk,
having gone back to the monastery, told this matter to the monks. They said:
“But do you, your reverence, wear long nails?”</p>
<p>“Yes, your reverences.” Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:
“How can this monk wear long nails?” Then these monks told this matter to the
Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, long nails should not be worn. Whoever should wear them, there is an

<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.185" href="#BD.5.185"></a>
Now at that time monks cut their nails with their nails and they cut their
nails with their mouth and they rubbed them down on a wattle and daub wall;
their fingers became painful. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, cutting of the nails.</span>” They cut their nails down to the blood; their fingers became painful. “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to cut your nails down to the height of the flesh.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time the group of six monks had their twenty (nails) polished.
People … spread it about, saying: “Like householders who enjoy pleasures of the
senses.” They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “ <span class="rule">Monks, you should not have your twenty (nails) polished. Whoever should have

Now at that time monks’ hair came to be long. They told this matter to the

<p>“They are able (to do so), Lord.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.134" href="#Vin.2.134"></a>
Then the Lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned

<p>Now at that time a certain monk came to have a sore on a certain part of his

Now at that time a certain monk’s ears were stopped with wax.

They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, an instrument for removing dirt from the ears.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time the group of six monks used various kinds of instruments for
removing dirt from the ears, made of gold, made of silver. People … spread it
about, saying: “Like householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses.” They told
this matter to the Lord. He said: “ <span class="rule">Monks, various kinds of instruments for removing dirt from the ears should not

Now at that time monks made a large store of copper goods, of bronze goods.
People touring the dwelling-place, having seen this, looked down upon,
criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can these recluses, sons of the
Sakyans make a large store of copper goods, of bronze goods like dealers in

Now at that time monks were (too) scrupulous to use an ointment box and an

They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, an ointment box … a handle.</span>”</p>

<p>Now at that time the group of six monks sat down lolling on their outer cloaks,
the cotton cloth of the outer cloaks gave way. They told this matter to the

<p>Now at that time a certain monk came to be ill; there was no comfort for him

and that monk <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.136" href="#Vin.2.136"></a>
became ashamed. Then that monk, having gone back to the monastery, told this
matter to the monks. The monks told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, you should not enter a village without your waistband. Whoever should

Now at that time monks did not chew tooth-wood; their mouths came to smell
nasty. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Monks, there are these five
disadvantages in not chewing tooth-wood: it is bad for the eyes, the mouth
becomes nasty smelling, the channels of taste are not purified, phelgm and

<hr>
<p>Now at that time dwelling-places were tangled over with grass. As the forest
fires were burning (forests and so on) they burned the dwelling-places. Monks
were doubtful whether to make a counter-fire to give protection. They told this

<p>Now at that time an elephant infested the way of a certain monk who was going
to Sāvatthī through the Kosalan districts. Then that monk rushed up to the foot
of a certain tree (but) being scrupulous did not climb the tree; the elephant
went off by another (track). Then that monk, having reached Sāvatthī, told this
matter to the monks. (The monks told this matter to the Lord). He said: “ <span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, if there is a reason, to climb a tree to the height of a

Now at that time Yameḷu and Tekula were the names of two monks who were
brothers, brahmins by birth, with lovely voices, with lovely enunciation. They
approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, they sat down
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.194" href="#BD.5.194"></a>
at a respectful distance. As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,
these monks spoke thus to the Lord: “At present, Lord, monks of various names,
various clans, various social strata have gone forth from various families;
these corrupt the speech of the Awakened One in (using) his own dialect. Now
we, Lord, give the speech of the Awakened One in metrical form.” The Awakened
One, the Lord rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, speak thus: ‘Now we, Lord, give the speech of the
Awakened One in metrical form’? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who
are not (yet) pleased …” And having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk,
he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“
<span class="rule">Monks, the speech of the Awakened One should not be given in metrical form.
Whoever should (so) give it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to learn the speech of the Awakened One according to his

Now at that time the group of six monks learnt metaphysics. People … spread it
about, saying: “Like householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses.” Monks
heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks told this matter to
the Lord. He said: “Now, monks, can one who sees the essence (as being) in
metaphysics attain to growth, increase, maturity in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline?”</p>
<p>“This is not so, Lord.”</p>
<p>“Or could one who sees the essence (as being) in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline learn metaphysics?”</p>

Now at
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.140" href="#Vin.2.140"></a>
that time the Lord, surrounded by a large assembly, sneezed while he was
teaching <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Monks, saying: “Lord, may the Lord live (long), may the wellfarer live
(long),” made a loud noise, a great noise; the talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> was interrupted by this noise. Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying:
“Now, monks, when (the phrase) ‘Long life’ is spoken to one who has sneezed,
can he for this reason live or die?”</p>
<p>“That is not so, Lord.”</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, ‘Long life’ should not be said to one who has sneezed. Whoever should
say it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time people said “May you live (long), honoured sirs” to monks who
had sneezed. The monks, being scrupulous, did not respond. People … spread it
about, saying: “How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans not respond when
(the phrase) ‘May you live (long), honoured sirs’ is being spoken to them?”
They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Monks, householders like lucky
signs. <span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, when (the phrase) ‘May you live (long), honoured sirs’ is

Now at that time the Lord, surrounded by a large assembly, was teaching <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> sitting down. A certain monk had eaten garlic; he sat down to one side,
thinking: “In case the monks are incommoded.” The Lord saw that monk who was
sitting down at one side; seeing him, he addressed the monks, saying: “Monks,
why is this monk sitting to one side?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.196" href="#BD.5.196"></a>
“Lord, this monk has eaten garlic, so he sat down at one side, thinking: ‘In
case the monks are incommoded’.”</p>
<p>“But, monks, should that be eaten which, when eaten, can (make the eater)
outside such a <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk as this?”</p>
<p>“That is not so, Lord.”</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, garlic should not be eaten. Whoever should eat it, there is an offence

<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.15.34.2" href="#Kd.15.34.2"></a>
Now at that time the venerable Sāriputta had wind in his stomach. Then the
venerable Moggallāna the Great approached the venerable Sāriputta; having
approached, he spoke thus to the venerable Sāriputta: “When you had wind in
your stomach before, reverend Sāriputta, by what means did you get comfort?”</p>
<p>“I had garlic, your reverence.” They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to eat garlic in the case of illness.</span>”</p>

Now at that time monks relieved themselves here, there and everywhere in a
monastery; the monastery was soiled. They told this matter to the Lord. He
said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you monks, to relieve yourselves at one side.</span>”
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.141" href="#Vin.2.141"></a>
The monastery became nasty smelling. “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a vessel.</span>” Sitting down, it was painful. “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, urinal shoes.</span>” The urinal shoes were public; monks were ashamed to relieve themselves. “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, three (kinds of) fences to fence them in: a fence of bricks, a

<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.197" href="#BD.5.197"></a>
they fell off. “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to evacuate having spread (something) and made a hole in

having evacuated, fell down as he was getting up. They told this matter to the
Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a chair with supports.</span>” The hut was not fenced in. “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, three (kinds of) fences with which to fence it in: a fence of

There was no porch. “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a porch.</span>” There was no door to the porch. “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a door … … a cord to pull through.</span>” Powdered grass fell on to the porch … “<span class="allowance">… five (pieces of) cloth design.</span>” A cell became swampy … “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a drain for the water.</span>” There was no vessel for the water for rinsing. “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a vessel for the water for rinsing.</span>” There was no saucer for the water for rinsing. “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a saucer for the water for rinsing.</span>” They rinsed sitting down; it was painful. “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, shoes to be worn for rinsing.</span>” The shoes for rinsing were public; monks were ashamed to rinse. “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, three (kinds of) fences to fence them in: a fence of bricks, a

planted and caused to be planted small flowering trees … and indulged in

Now at the time when Kassapa of Uruvelā went forth many copper goods, wooden
goods, clay goods accrued to the Order. Then it occurred to the monks: “Now,
what copper goods are allowed by the Lord, what are not allowed? What wooden

razor, whetstone, razor-case, piece of felt, a barber’s equipment,<br>
They trimmed beards, they let them grow, goat’s beard, four cornered
arrangement,<br>
on their chests and on their stomachs, whiskers, removed the hair on their
bodies,<br>
Illness, scissors, a sore, long, and with a piece of crystal,<br>
grey hair, stopped, and various kinds of copper goods, a store,<br>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.202" href="#BD.5.202"></a>
And lolling, a bandage, strings, tickets, (waist-)band,<br>
those of many strands, like the head of a water-snake, like tambourine drums,
those like chains,<br>
Palmyra whisk, hundred jungle-ropes, having put on householders’ upper
garments,<br>
loin cloths, double carrying-pole, toothwood, on flicking, <br>
Lodged in the throat, and a forest, counterfire, a tree, and by an elephant,<br>
Yamelu (and Tekula), they learnt metaphysics, they taught it,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.2.145" href="#Vin.2.145"></a>
<br>
Worldly knowledge, he sneezed, good luck, and he ate,<br>
affliction of wind, and it was soiled, nasty smelling, painful, shoes,<br>
They were ashamed, nasty smelling (un-) covered, and they did it here and
there,<br>
nasty smelling, cesspool, it fell in, high to the ground, and about a piling,<br>
Staircase, balustrade, inside, painful and shoes, <br>
outside, a tub and wood, and a stick, uncovered, <br>
A hut tor the privy, both a door as well as a doorpost and lintel,<br>
a hollow like a mortar, an upper projection, a post, and a “monkey’s head,”<br>
A pin, a bolt, a keyhole, and a hole for pulling (cord) through as well as<br>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.203" href="#BD.5.203"></a>
a cord, a smearing inside and out, whitewash and black colouring<br>
Wreathwork creeperwork swordfish five strips of cloth (design)<br>
a bamboo and a cord for robes, weak through age, a fence,<br>
And about a porch, as before, and gravel, flagstones,<br>
(water) remained, a drain, and also a vessel, a saucer, <br>
Painful, shame, a lid, and they indulged in bad habits.<br>
He allowed copper goods a weapon being excepted.<br>
A sofa and divan, a wooden bowl and shoes being excepted—<br>
the Great Sage allowed all (other) goods made of wood.<br>
And the Truth-finder, a (clay foot-) scrubber and an earthern vessel having
been excepted,<br>
compassionate, allowed also all (other) goods made of clay.<br>
The character of whatever matter, if equal to the preceding,<br>
even if it is brief, is known from the context in the key.<br>
Thus the hundred and ten matters in the Minor Matters in the discipline<br>
are based on what is <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> indeed—also there is help for the well behaved. <br>
The expert in discipline is well trained, friendly in mind, very well behaved,<br>
bringing light, steadfast, worthy of honour, one who has heard much.
