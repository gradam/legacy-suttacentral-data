… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the nun Thullanandā was very learned, she was a repeater, she was wise, she was
skilled in giving <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk. Many people visited the nun Thullanandā. Now at that time the nun
Thullanandā’s cell was falling to pieces. People spoke thus to the nun
Thullanandā: “Why is this cell of yours, lady, falling to pieces?”</p>
<p>“Sirs, there are neither benefactors, nor are there workmen.”</p>
<p>Then these people, having made a voluntary collection for the nun Thullanandā’s
cell, gave what was necessary to the nun Thullanandā. And the nun Thullanandā,
although having herself asked for what was necessary, yet having got medicine
in exchange, made use of it. The people, having found out … spread it about,
saying: “How can the lady Thullanandā get something in exchange for what was
necessary (and) appointed for another thing, destined for another thing,
belonging to an individual, (and) that she herself asked for?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā … (and) that she
herself asked for?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … (and) that she herself asked for? It is
not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of
training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should get something in exchange for what was necessary (and)
appointed for another <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.237" href="#BD.3.237"></a>
thing, destined for another thing, belonging to an individual, (and) that she
herself asked for, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>
