<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.321" href="#BD.2.321"></a>
… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.79" href="#Vin.4.79"></a>
time a woman lay-follower, the mother of Kāṇā, had faith and was virtuous. Kāṇā
came to be given to a certain man in a village. Then Kāṇā went to her mother’s
house on some business or other. Then Kāṇā’s husband sent a messenger to Kāṇā,
saying: “Let Kāṇā come back, I desire Kāṇā’s return.” Then the woman
lay-follower, Kāṇā’s mother, saying: “It is awkward to go empty-handed,” cooked
a cake. When the cake was cooked, a certain monk walking for alms came up to
the dwelling of the woman lay-follower, Kāṇā’s mother. Then the woman
lay-follower, Kāṇā’s mother, gave the cake to that monk. He, having gone away,
told another, and she gave him a cake. He, having gone away, told another, and
she gave him a cake. As soon as a cake was <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.322" href="#BD.2.322"></a>
ready it disappeared. A second time did Kāṇā’s husband send a messenger to
Kāṇā, saying: “Let Kāṇā, come back, I desire Kāṇā’s return.” A second time did
the woman lay-follower, Kāṇā’s mother, saying: “It is awkward to go
empty-handed” … it disappeared. A third time did Kāṇā’s husband send a
messenger to Kāṇā, saying: “Let Kāṇā, come back, I desire Kāṇā’s return. If
Kāṇā does not come back, I will take another wife.” A third time did the woman
lay-follower, Kāṇā’s mother, saying: “It is awkward to go empty-handed” … it
disappeared. Then Kāṇā’s husband procured another wife. Kāṇā heard: “It is said
that another wife is taken by this man.” She stood weeping. Then the lord,
dressing in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, came up to the dwelling of
that woman lay-follower, Kāṇā’s mother, and having come up he sat down on the
appointed seat. Then the woman lay-follower, Kāṇā’s mother, approached the
lord, and having approached and greeted the lord, she sat down at a respectful
distance. As she was sitting down at a respectful distance, the lord spoke thus
to the woman lay-follower, Kāṇā’s mother:</p>
<p>“Why does this Kāṇā weep?”</p>
<p>Then the woman lay-follower, Kāṇā’s mother, told this matter to the lord. Then
the lord, having … gladdened the woman lay-follower, Kāṇā’s mother, with talk
on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, rising up from his seat, departed.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.34.1.2" href="#Bu-Pc.34.1.2"></a>
Now at that time a certain caravan was desirous of going from Rājagaha to the
south. A certain monk, walking for alms-food, entered that caravan for
alms-food. A certain lay-follower had barley-meal given to <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.323" href="#BD.2.323"></a>
that monk. He, having gone away, told another, and he had barley-meal given to
him. He, having gone away, told another, and he had barley-meal given to him.
He, having gone away, told another, and he had barley-meal given to him. As
soon as provisions for the journey were ready, they disappeared. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.80" href="#Vin.4.80"></a>
Then that lay-follower said to these people:</p>
<p>“Masters, wait until tomorrow. As soon as provisions for the journey are ready,
they are given to the masters. I will prepare provisions for the journey.”</p>
<p>Saying: “Master, we are unable to wait, the caravan is setting out,” they went
away. Then as that lay-follower, having prepared provisions for the journey,
was going along last, thieves robbed (him). People … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the recluses, sons of the Sakyans, not knowing moderation, accept
(provisions)? This (man) having given to them, going along last, was robbed by
thieves.”</p>
<p>Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks told this
matter to the lord. Then the lord in this connection, on this occasion, having
given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Because of this, monks, I will make known a rule of training for monks,
founded on ten reasons: for the excellence of the Order … for following the
rules of restraint. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set
forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">If a monk, going up to a family, (who) asking, should invite him (to take)
cakes or barley-gruel, two or three <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.324" href="#BD.2.324"></a>
bowlfuls may be accepted by a monk desiring them. Should he accept more than
that, there is an offence of expiation. Having accepted two or three bowlfuls,
having taken them back from there, they must be shared together with the monks.
This is the proper course in this case.”</span></p>

such and such a place, so do not accept (anything) there.’ If, seeing (him), he
does not tell (him), there is an offence of wrong-doing. If, although told, he
accepts, there is an offence of wrong-doing. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.81" href="#Vin.4.81"></a>
