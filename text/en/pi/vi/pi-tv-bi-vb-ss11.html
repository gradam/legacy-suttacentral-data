… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the nun Caṇḍakālī, overthrown in some legal question, angry, displeased, spoke
thus: “The nuns are following a wrong course through desire <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.238" href="#Vin.4.238"></a>
and the nuns are following a wrong course through hatred and the nuns are
following a wrong course through stupidity and the nuns are following a wrong
course through fear.” Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:
“How can the lady, the nun Caṇḍakālī … displeased, speak thus: ‘… and the nuns
are following a wrong course through fear’?” …</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Caṇḍakālī, … displeased, speak thus: ‘… and the nuns
are following a wrong course through fear’? It is not, monks, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased … set forth this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, overthrown in some legal question, angry, displeased, should
speak thus: ‘The nuns are following a wrong course through desire … and the
nuns are following a wrong course through fear,’ that nun should be spoken to
thus by the nuns: ‘Do not, lady, overthrown in some legal question, angry,
displeased, speak thus: “The nuns are following a wrong course through desire …
and the nuns are following a wrong course through fear.” The lady herself may
go (wrong) from desire, and she may go (wrong) from hatred and she may go
(wrong) from stupidity and she may go (wrong) from fear.’ And if this nun,
being <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.206" href="#BD.3.206"></a>
spoken to thus by the nuns, persists as before, she should be admonished up to
a third time for giving up that (course). If, being admonished up to a third
time, she should give it up, that is good. If she should not give it up, that
nun also has fallen into a matter that is an offence on the third (admonition),
entailing a formal meeting of the Order involving being sent away.”</span></p>

told. And a third time she should be told … <span class="add">see
