At one time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s
monastery. Now at that time a milk drink had been prepared for the Order by a
certain brahmin. The monks drank the milk making a hissing sound. A certain
monk who had formerly been an actor spoke thus: “It seems that this whole Order
is cooled.” Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can
this monk make a joke about the Order?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monk, made a joke about the Order?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, make a joke about the Order? It is not, foolish man,
for pleasing those who <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.138" href="#BD.3.138"></a>
are not (yet) pleased …” … and having rebuked him, having given reasoned talk,
he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks, a joke should not be made about the enlightened one or <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> or the Order. Whoever should make (one), there is an offence of wrong-doing.”</p>
<p>Then the lord, having rebuked that monk in many a figure for his difficulty in
maintaining himself … “… And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set
forth:</p>
<p>‘I will not eat making a hissing sound,’ is a training to be observed.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.198" href="#Vin.4.198"></a>
</p>
<p>One should not eat making a hissing sound … if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
