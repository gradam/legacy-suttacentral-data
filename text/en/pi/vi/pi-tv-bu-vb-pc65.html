… at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding-place. Now at that
time in Rājagaha a group of seventeen boys were friends; of these the youth
Upāli was the chief. Then it occurred to Upāli’s parents: “By what means could
Upāli, after our demise, live at ease and not be in want?” Then it occurred to
Upāli’s parents: “If Upāli should learn writing, so would Upāli, after our
demise, live at ease and not be in want.” Then it occurred to Upāli’s parents:
“But if Upāli learns writing, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.129" href="#Vin.4.129"></a>
his fingers will become painful. If Upāli should learn calculation, so would
Upāli, after our demise, live at ease and not be in want.” Then it occurred to
Upāli’s parents: “But if Upāli learns calculation, his breast will become
painful. If Upāli should learn money-changing, so would Upāli, after our
demise, live at ease and not be in want.” Then it occurred to Upāli’s parents:
“But if Upāli learns money-changing, his eyes will become painful. Now there
are these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.11" href="#BD.3.11"></a>
pleasant in habit, pleasant in conduct; having eaten good meals they lie down
on beds sheltered from the wind. Now if Upāli should go forth among the
recluses, the sons of the Sakyans, so would Upāli, after our demise, live at
ease and not be in want.”</p>
<p>The boy Upāli heard this conversation of (his) parents. Then the boy Upāli
approached those boys, and having approached he spoke thus to those boys:
“Come, masters, we will go forth among the recluses, sons of the Sakyans.”</p>
<p>“If you, master, will go forth, we likewise will also go forth.”</p>
<p>Then these boys, having each approached (his) parents, spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Consent that I may go forth from home into homelessness.”</p>
<p>Then the parents of those boys consented, thinking: “All these boys desire the
same thing, they are bent on what is good.” These, having approached monks,
asked for the going forth. The monks let them go forth, they conferred the <i lang="pi">upasampadā</i> ordination on them. Getting up in the night towards dawn, these cried out:</p>
<p>“Give conjey, give rice, give solid food.”</p>
<p>The monks spoke thus: “Wait, your reverences, until it turns light.” Should
there be conjey, you shall drink it; should there be rice, you shall partake of
it; should there be solid food, you shall eat it. But should there not be
conjey or rice or solid food, having walked for alms, you shall eat.”</p>
<p>But those monks, being spoken to thus by the monks, cried out just the same:
“Give conjey, give rice, give solid food,” and they soiled the bedding and made
it wet.</p>
<p>The lord, getting up in the night towards the dawn, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.12" href="#BD.3.12"></a>
heard the noise of the boys, and hearing (it) he addressed the venerable
Ānanda, saying:</p>
<p>“Why ever, Ānanda, is there this noise of boys?”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Ānanda told this matter to the lord. Then the lord, on this
occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of monks convened,
questioned the monks, saying: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.130" href="#Vin.4.130"></a>
</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that monks knowingly conferred the <i lang="pi">upasampadā</i> ordination on an individual under twenty years of age?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can these
foolish men knowingly confer the <i lang="pi">upasampadā</i>, ordination on an individual under twenty years of age? Monks, an individual
under twenty years of age is not able to endure cold, heat, hunger, thirst,
contact with gadflies, mosquitoes, wind and sun, creeping things, abusive
hurtful language; he is not the kind (of person) who endures bodily feelings
which, arising, are painful, acute, sharp, shooting, disagreeable, miserable,
deadly. But, monks, an individual of twenty years of age is able to endure
cold, heat … miserable, deadly. Monks, this is not for pleasing those who are
not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set
forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should knowingly confer the <i lang="pi">upasampadā</i> ordination on an individual under twenty years of age, both that individual is
not ordained and these monks are blameworthy; this is for him an offence of
expiation.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.13" href="#BD.3.13"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… monk is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">He knows</span> means:
<span class="gloss">either he knows by himself or others tell him or (someone) tells (him).</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Under twenty years of age</span> means:
<span class="gloss">not attained to twenty years of age.</span></p>
<p>If he thinks, “I will confer the <i lang="pi">upasampadā</i> ordination,” (and) looks about for a group or for a teacher or for a bowl or
for a robe, or if he determines a boundary, there is an offence of wrong-doing.
As a result of the motion there is an offence of wrong-doing; as a result of
two proclamations there are offences of wrong-doing. At the end of the
proclamations, there is an offence of expiation for the preceptor, an offence
of wrong-doing for the group and for the teacher.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.65.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.65.2.2"></a>
If he thinks that he is under twenty years of age when he is under twenty years
of age, (and) confers the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.14" href="#BD.3.14"></a>
<i lang="pi">upasampadā</i> ordination (on him), there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to
whether he is under twenty years of age, and confers the <i lang="pi">upasampadā</i> ordination (on him), there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that he
has completed twenty years of age when he is under twenty years of age, (and)
confers the <i lang="pi">upasampadā</i> ordination (on him), there is no offence. If he thinks that he is under twenty
years of age when he has completed twenty years of age, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether he has completed twenty years of
age there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that he has completed
twenty years of age when he has completed twenty years of age, there is no
offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.65.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.65.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if he confers the <i lang="pi">upasampadā</i> ordination on one under twenty years of age thinking that he has completed
twenty years of age; if he confers the <i lang="pi">upasampadā</i> ordination on one who has completed twenty years of age thinking that they are
completed; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
