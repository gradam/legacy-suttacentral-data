… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks made a hoard of many bowls. People, engaged in touring
the dwelling-place and seeing (this hoard), looked down upon, criticised,
spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, make a hoard of many bowls? Will
these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, do a trade in bowls or will they set up an
earthenware shop?” Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who
were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this group of six monks keep an extra bowl?” Then these monks told
this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, keep an extra bowl?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.” The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, keep an extra bowl? It is not, foolish men, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.243" href="#Vin.3.243"></a>
And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="subrule">Whatever monk should keep an extra bowl, there is an offence of expiation
involving forfeiture.”</span></p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-NP.21.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.21.2.1" href="#Bu-NP.21.2.1"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.114" href="#BD.2.114"></a>
Now at that time an extra bowl had accrued to the venerable Ānanda, and the
venerable Ānanda became desirous of giving this bowl to the venerable
Sāriputta; but the venerable Sāriputta was staying at Sāketa. Then it occurred
to the venerable Ānanda: “A rule of training laid down by the lord is that an
extra bowl should not be kept. And this extra bowl has accrued to me, and I am
desirous of giving this bowl to the venerable Sāriputta, but the venerable
Sāriputta is staying at Sāketa. Now what line of conduct should be followed by
me?” Then the venerable Ānanda told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“But, how long, Ānanda, before Sāriputta will come (here)?”</p>
<p>“On the ninth or tenth day, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>Then the lord, on that occasion, in that connection, having given reasoned
talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to keep an extra bowl for at most ten days. And thus,
monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">An extra bowl may be kept for at most ten days. For him who exceeds that
(period), there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-NP.21.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.21.3.1" href="#Bu-NP.21.3.1"></a>
<span class="term">For at most ten days</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it may be kept for ten days at the maximum.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">An extra bowl</span> means:
<span class="gloss">one that is not allotted, not assigned.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.115" href="#BD.2.115"></a>
<span class="term">A bowl</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there are two kinds of bowls: an iron bowl, a clay bowl. There are three sizes
for a bowl: a large bowl, a medium-sized bowl, a small bowl. A large bowl means
that it takes half an <i lang="pi">āḷhaka</i> measure of boiled rice, a quarter of that quantity of uncooked rice, a
suitable curry. A medium-sized bowl means that it takes a <i lang="pi">nāḷika</i> measure of boiled rice, a quarter of that quantity of uncooked rice, a
suitable curry. A small bowl means that it takes a <i lang="pi">pattha</i> measure of boiled rice, a quarter of that quantity of uncooked rice, a
suitable curry. (A bowl) greater than that is not a bowl, (a bowl) smaller
(than that) is not a bowl.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">For him who exceeds (that period), there is an offence involving forfeiture</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is to be forfeited on the eleventh day at sunrise.</span> It should be forfeited to … an individual. And thus, monks, should it be
forfeited: That monk, approaching the Order, arranging his upper robe over one
shoulder, honouring the feet of the senior monks, sitting down on his haunches,
saluting with <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.116" href="#BD.2.116"></a>
joined palms, should speak thus:
<span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.244" href="#Vin.3.244"></a>
this bowl is to be forfeited by me, the ten days having elapsed. I forfeit it
to the Order.’</span> Having forfeited it, the offence should be confessed. The offence should be
acknowledged by an experienced, competent monk; the bowl forfeited should be
given (back with the words): <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This bowl of the monk so and so,
which had to be forfeited, is forfeited (by him) to the Order. If it seems
right to the Order, the Order should give back this bowl to the monk so and
so.’</span></p>
<p>That monk, approaching two or three monks … <span class="add">See <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bu-vb-np1#Bu-NP.1.3">Bu-NP.1.3</a>–<a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bu-vb-np1#Bu-NP.1.4">Bu-NP.1.4</a></span> … ‘… I will give back this bowl to the venerable one.’ …</p>
<p>… If he thinks that one is destroyed when it is not destroyed, there is an
offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that one is broken when
it is not broken, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he
thinks that one is stolen when it is not stolen, there is an offence of
expiation involving forfeiture. Not forfeiting the bowl which had to be
forfeited, if he makes use of it, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he
thinks that the ten days have elapsed when they have not elapsed, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether the ten days have not
elapsed, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that the ten days
have not elapsed when they have not elapsed, there is no offence.</p>
<p>There is no offence if within ten days it is allotted, assigned, bestowed,
lost, destroyed, broken, if they tear it from him, if they take it on trust; if
he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>

Then the group of six monks did not give back a bowl that had been forfeited.
They told this matter <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.117" href="#BD.2.117"></a>
to the lord. He said: “Monks, a bowl that has been forfeited is not not to be
given back. Whosoever should not give it back, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.”</p>
