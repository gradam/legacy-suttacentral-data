… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
two nuns shared one covering-cloth. People, engaged in touring the
dwelling-place … <span class="add">see

<em>Instead of</em> one couch
<em>read</em> one covering-cloth</span> … “… this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever two nuns should share one covering-cloth, there is an offence of
expiation.</span>”</p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Nuns</span> mean: they are called ordained.</p>
<p><span class="term">Two should share one covering-cloth</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if having covered themselves with that, they put that on, there is an offence
of expiation.</span></p>

If they think that it is one covering-cloth when it is one covering-cloth (and)
share it, there is an offence of expiation. If they are in doubt as to whether
it is one covering-cloth … If they think they are different covering-cloths
when it is one covering-cloth … offence of expiation. If they think that they
are different cloths when it is one covering, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.306" href="#BD.3.306"></a>
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If they think that it is one covering-cloth
when they are different coverings, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If they
think that it is one covering-cloth when they are different covering-cloths,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If they are in doubt as to whether they are
different covering-cloths, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If they think
that they are different covering-cloths when they are different
covering-cloths, there is no offence.</p>

There is no offence if they lie down having pointed out an arrangement; if they
are mad, if they are the first wrong-doers. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.290" href="#Vin.4.290"></a></p>
