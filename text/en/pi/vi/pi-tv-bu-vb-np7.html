<h1>Monks’ Relinquishment 7: too much</h1>
</div>
<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.7.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.50"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1998"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time some of the monks belonging to the group of six said this to the monks whose robes had been taken:</p>
<p>“The Master has allowed a monk whose robes have been taken or lost to ask an unrelated householder for robes. You should ask for a robe.”</p>
<p>“It’s not necessary; we have already obtained robes.”</p>
<p>“We will ask for you.”</p>
<p>“Do as you please.”</p>
<p>Then those monks belonging to the group of six went to householders and said: “Monks whose robes have been taken have arrived. Give them robes.” And they asked for many robes.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.214"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1999"></a>Soon afterwards in the town meeting hall a certain man said to another: “Sir, monks whose robes have been taken have arrived. I have given them robes.”</p>
<p>“I too have given robes.” And another said the same.</p>
<p>They grumbled and complained: “How can the Sakyan ascetics have no sense of moderation and ask for many robes? Will they start up as cloth merchants or set up a shop?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2000"></a>Monks heard the complaints of those people, and <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.51"></a> the monks of few desires … complained and criticised those monks: “How could those monks belonging to the group of six not have any sense of moderation and ask for many robes?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2001"></a>After criticising those monks in many ways, they informed the Master … “Is it true, monks, that you did not have any sense of moderation and asked for many robes?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, criticised them: “… Foolish men, how could you not have any sense of moderation and ask for many robes? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2 class="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2002"></a>“If an unrelated male or female householder invites him to take many robes, he should accept at most one lower robe and one upper robe. If he accepts more than that, he commits and offence entailing relinquishment and confession.”</p>

<p>In the act of asking for too much, he commit an offence of wrongdoing. If he gets the robe, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment. The robe is to be relinquished to a Sangha, a group, or an individual.</p>
<p>“And, monks, it is to be relinquished in this way. … <a href="/en/pi-tv-bu-vb-np1#Bu-NP.1.3.2">Bu-NP.1.3.2</a>, with appropriate substitutions. … ‘Bhante, this robe of mine, which I received after asking an unrelated householder for too much, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.215"></a> is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ … the Sangha should give … the Venerables should give … ‘I give this robe back to the Venerable.’”</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.7.2.2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2011"></a>If the person is unrelated and he perceives them as unrelated, and he asks them for too many robes, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession. If the person is unrelated, but he has doubts about it, and he asks them for too many robes, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession. If the person is unrelated, but he perceives them as related, and he asks them for too many robes, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2012"></a>If the person is related, but he perceive them a unrelated, he commit an offence of bad conduct. If the person is related, but he has doubts about it, he commit an offence of bad conduct. If the person is related and he perceive them as related, there is no offence.</p>
<h2 class="anapatti">Non-offences</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.7.2.3"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2013"></a>There is no offence: if he takes too much, but with the intention of returning the remainder; if they give, saying, “The remainder is for you”; if they give, but not because his robes were taken from him; if they give, but not because his robes were lost; if it is from relatives; if it is from those who have given an invitation; if it is by means of his own property; if he is insane; if he is the first offender.</p>
