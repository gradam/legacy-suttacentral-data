… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. At that time the
group of six monks having come up to monks whose robes had been stolen, said:
“Your reverences, one whose robe has been stolen or one whose robe has been
destroyed is allowed by the lord to ask for a robe from a man or woman
householder who is not a relation; your reverences, ask (them) for a robe.”</p>
<p>They said: “No, we don’t want (one), your reverences, a robe has been obtained
by us.”</p>
<p>“We are asking for the venerable ones,” they said.</p>
<p>“Do ask (them), your reverences.”</p>
<p>Then the group of six monks, having approached householders, said:</p>
<p>“Sirs, monks are coming whose robes have been stolen; give them robes,” (and)
they asked for many robes. At that <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.214" href="#Vin.3.214"></a>
time a certain man who was sitting in a village assembly hall said to another
man:</p>
<p>“Master, monks are coming whose robes have been stolen; I gave them a robe.”</p>
<p>Then he said: “I also gave (to them).”</p>
<p>Then another man said: “I also gave (to them).”</p>
<p>These men … spread it about, saying: “How can these recluses, sons of the
Sakyans, not knowing moderation, ask for many robes? Will the recluses, sons of
the Sakyans, deal in the cloth trade or will they set up a shop?”</p>
<p>The monks heard these men who … spread it about.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.51" href="#BD.2.51"></a>
Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can the group of
six monks, not knowing moderation, ask for many robes?” Then these monks told
this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, not knowing moderation, asked for
many robes?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, not knowing moderation, ask for many robes? It is
not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus,
monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">If a man or a woman householder who is not a relation, asking (a monk), should
invite him (to take material for) many robes, then at most (material for) an
inner and an upper robe should be accepted as robe-material by that monk; if he
should accept more than that, there is an offence of expiation involving
forfeiture.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Him</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the monk whose robe has been stolen.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">A man who is not a relation</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… <span class="add">See <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bu-vb-np6#Bu-NP.6.3.1">Bu-NP.6.3.1</a></span> … she who lives in a house.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">(For) many robes</span> means:
<span class="gloss">(for) abundant robes.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Asking, should invite</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he says, “Take just as much as you want.”</span></p>
<p><span class="term">At most (material for) an inner and an upper robe <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.52" href="#BD.2.52"></a>
should be accepted as robe-material by that monk</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if the three (robes) come to be destroyed, two may be accepted; if two are
destroyed, one may be accepted; if one is destroyed nothing may be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">If he should accept more than that</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he asks for more than that there is an offence of wrong-domg in the action.
It is to be forfeited on acquisition; it should be forfeited to the Order, or
to a group, or to an individual. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited:
‘Honoured sirs, having gone up to a householder who is not a relation, this
robe material asked for by me more than that (which I should ask for), <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.215" href="#Vin.3.215"></a>
is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to the Order.’ … ‘… the Order should give back
… let the venerable ones give back … I will give back this robe to the
venerable one.’</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.7.2.2" href="#Bu-NP.7.2.2"></a>
If he thinks that a man is not a relation when is he not a relation (and) asks
for robe-material more than that (which he should ask for), there is an offence
of expiation involving forfeiture. If he is in doubt as to whether he is not a
relation … <span class="add">See <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bu-vb-np6#Bu-NP.6.2">Bu-NP.6.2</a></span> … is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.7.2.3" href="#Bu-NP.7.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if, saying: ‘I will take the remainder,’ taking it he goes
away; if they give the remainder, saying: ‘Let it be only for you’; if they do
not give because (a robe was) stolen; if they do not give because (a robe was)
destroyed; if they belong to relations; if they are invited; if it is by means
of his own property; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
