… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. At that time a
robe accrued to a certain monk not at the right time. The robe, as they made
it, did not suffice for him. Then <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.203" href="#Vin.3.203"></a>
that monk, pulling out that robe, smoothed it again and again. The lord, as he
was engaged in touring the lodgings, saw this monk pulling out this robe and
smoothing it again and again, and seeing him he approached this monk, and
having approached he said to this monk:</p>
<p>“Why, monk, do you, pulling out this robe, smooth it again and again?”</p>
<p>“Lord, this robe which accrued to me not at the right time, as they made it
does not suffice for me, therefore do I, pulling out this robe, smooth it again
and again.”</p>
<p>“But, monk, is there for you an expectation of a robe?”</p>
<p>“There is, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>Then the lord on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk,
addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks, I allow you, having accepted a robe not at the right time, to lay it
aside in the expectation of a robe.”</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.3.1.2" href="#Bu-NP.3.1.2"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.25" href="#BD.2.25"></a>
Then monks said: “It is allowed by the lord, if a robe has been accepted not at
the right time, to lay it aside in the expectation of a robe.” These, accepting
robes not at the right time, laid them aside for more than a month. These
robes, tied up in bundles, remained on a bamboo for hanging up robes. Then the
venerable Ānanda, as he was engaged in touring the lodgings, saw these robes
tied up in bundles that remained on the bamboo for hanging up robes. Seeing
them, he addressed the monks thus:</p>
<p>“Your reverences, whose are these robes, tied up in bundles, that remain on the
bamboo for hanging up robes?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, they are our robes, given not at the right time, that are laid
aside in the expectation of robes.”</p>
<p>“But for how long, your reverences, have these robes been laid aside?”</p>
<p>“For more than a month, your reverence,” they said. Then the venerable Ānanda
looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can these monks, having accepted robe-material not at the right time, lay
it aside for more than a month?”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Ānanda told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that monks having accepted robe-material not at
the right time, laid it aside for more than a month?” “It is true, lord,” they
said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can these foolish men, having accepted robe-material not at the
right time, lay it aside for more than a month? It is not, monks, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus also, monks, this rule of training
should be set forth:</p>
<p>“
<span class="rule">When the robe-material is settled, when a monk’s <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.26" href="#BD.2.26"></a>
<i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges) have been removed, if robe-material should accrue to the monk not
at the right time, it may be accepted by that monk if he so wish. Having
accepted it, it should be made up quickly. But if it is not sufficient for him,
that robe-material may be laid aside by that monk for a month at most, should
he have any expectation that the deficiency may be supplied. If he should lay
it aside for longer than that, even with the expectation (of the deficiency
being supplied), there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.</span>”

<span class="term">If he should lay it aside for longer than that, even with the expectation (of
the deficiency being supplied)</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if a robe that was expected accrues on the very day that the first robe
accrues, he should have it made up within ten days. … If a robe that was
expected accrues two days … three days … four days … five days … six days …
seven days … eight days … nine days … ten days after the first robe accrues, he
should have it made up within ten days. If a robe that was expected accrues
eleven days … twelve days … thirteen days … fourteen days … fifteen days …
sixteen days … seventeen days … eighteen <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.28" href="#BD.2.28"></a>
days … nineteen days … twenty days after the first robe accrues, he should have
it made up within ten days … twenty-one days after the first robe accrues, he
should have it made up within nine days … twenty-two … twenty-three …
twenty-four … twenty-five … twenty-six days after the first robe accrues, he
should have it made up within four days. If a robe that was expected accrues
twenty-seven … twenty-eight … twenty-nine days … he should have it made up
within one day. If a robe that was expected accrues thirty days after the first
robe accrues, on that same day it should be allotted, assigned, bestowed. But
should it not be allotted or assigned or bestowed, it is to be forfeited on the
thirty-first day at sunrise; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.205" href="#Vin.3.205"></a>
it should be forfeited to the Order, or to a group, or to an individual. And
thus, monks, should it be forfeited: … <span class="kamma">‘This robe, honoured sirs, (given) not at the right time, is to be forfeited by
me, the month having elapsed. I forfeit it to the Order.’</span> …
<span class="kamma">‘The Order should give back … let the venerable ones give back … I will give
back this robe to the venerable one.’</span></span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.3.2.3" href="#Bu-NP.3.2.3"></a>
If the robe that was expected accrues but is different from the first robe that
has accrued, and there are some nights over, it should not be caused to be made
up unwillingly. If he thinks that a month has elapsed when it has elapsed,
there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he is in doubt as to
whether a month has elapsed … If he does not think that a month has elapsed
when it has elapsed … If he thinks that one is allotted when it is not allotted
… If he thinks that one is assigned when it is not assigned <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.29" href="#BD.2.29"></a>
… If he thinks that one is bestowed when it is not bestowed … If he thinks that
one is lost when it is not lost … If he thinks that one is destroyed when it is
not destroyed … If he thinks that one is burnt when it is not burnt … If he
thinks that one is stolen when it is not stolen, there is an offence of
expiation involving forfeiture. Not forfeiting the robe which had to be
forfeited, if he makes use of it, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he
thinks that a month has elapsed when it has not elapsed, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether a month has not elapsed, there is
an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that a month has not elapsed when it
has not elapsed, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.3.2.4" href="#Bu-NP.3.2.4"></a>
There is no offence if within a month it is allotted, assigned, bestowed, lost,
destroyed, burnt, if they tear it from him, if they take it on trust; if he is
mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
