<h1>Monks’ Relinquishment 3: the third training rule on the kathina period</h1>
</div>
<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-NP.3.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.3.1.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.24"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1921"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time a certain monk had been offered robe cloth outside of the robe season. While he was making the robe, he realised there was not enough cloth. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.203"></a> Lifting it up, he smoothed it out again and again.<span class="fn">The point, according to the commentary, is that he was trying to increase its size.</span></p>
<p>While inspecting the lodgings, the Master saw that monk acting in this way. He approached him and said: “Monk, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Bhante, I have received this robe cloth outside of the robe season, but it’s not enough to make a robe. This is why I lift it up and smooth it out again and again.”</p>
<p>“Do you expect to receive more cloth?”</p>
<p>“I do, Master.”</p>
<p>The Master then spoke on the Dhamma and addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow you to keep robe cloth if you expect to receive more.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.3.1.2"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.25"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1922"></a>When they knew that the Master had given this allowance, some monks kept robe cloth for over a month, even though it was outside the robe season. They kept it tied up in a bundle on a robe rack.</p>
<p>While inspecting the lodgings, Venerable Ānanda saw that robe cloth, and he asked the monks: “Whose robe cloth is this?”</p>
<p>“It is our out-of-season robe cloth, which we are keeping because we are expecting more cloth.”</p>
<p>“How long have you kept this cloth?”</p>
<p>“Over a month.”</p>
<p>Venerable Ānanda complained and criticised them: “How can these monks keep out-of-season robe cloth for over a month?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1923"></a>After criticising those monks in many ways, Venerable Ānanda informed the Master. … “Is it true, monks, that some monks keep out-of-season robe cloth for over a month?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, criticised them: “… How could these foolish men keep out-of-season robe cloth for over a month? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2 class="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1924"></a>“When his robe is finished and the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.26"></a> <i>kathina</i> period has ended, if out-of-season robe cloth is offered to a monk, he may receive it if he wishes. If he receives it, he should quickly make a robe. If there is not enough cloth, but he expects to get more, he should keep it at most one month to make up the lack. If he keeps it beyond that, even if he expects more cloth, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession.”</p>
