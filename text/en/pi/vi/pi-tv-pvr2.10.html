desire below the collar-bone, above the circle of the knees, there is an
offence involving Defeat. If a monk rubs (her) body with (his) body the offence
is one requiring a Formal Meeting of the Order. If she rubs something attached
to the body with the body there is a grave offence. If she rubs something
attached to the body with something attached to the body there is an offence of
wrong-doing. In tickling with the fingers there is an offence of Expiation.
