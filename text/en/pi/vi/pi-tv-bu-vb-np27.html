… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. At that time a
certain man, going off on a journey, said to his wife:</p>
<p>“Weighing yarn, give it to a certain weaver; getting him to weave
robe-material, take care of it; when I come back I will present master Upananda
with robe-material.”</p>
<p>A certain monk, as he was going for alms, heard this man as he was speaking
thus. Then this monk approached the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans,
and having approached he spoke thus to the venerable Upananda, the son of the
Sakyans:</p>
<p>“You, reverend Upananda, are of great merit, for at a certain place a certain
man, going off on a journey, said to his wife: ‘Weighing yarn … I will present
master Upananda with robe-material.’”</p>
<p>“Sir, he is my supporter,” he said. For this very weaver was the supporter of
the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans. Then the venerable Upananda,
the son of the Sakyans, approached this weaver, and having approached he spoke
thus to the weaver:</p>
<p>“Sir, this robe-material is being specially woven for me; make it long and wide
and rough, make it evenly <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.146" href="#BD.2.146"></a>
woven and well woven and well scraped and well combed.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, having weighed this yarn, they gave it to me, saying, ‘Weave
robe-material with this yarn.’ Honoured sir, I am not able to make it long or
wide or rough, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.258" href="#Vin.3.258"></a>
but I am able, honoured sir, to make it evenly woven and well woven and well
scraped and well combed.”</p>
<p>“You, if you please, sir, make it long and wide and rough; there will not come
to be a shortage of this yarn.”</p>
<p>Then that weaver, as soon as the yarn had been brought, setting it up on the
loom, went up to that woman, and having gone up he said to that woman: “The
master wants yarn.”</p>
<p>“Were not you, master, told by me: ‘Weave robe-material with that yarn’?”</p>
<p>“It is true that I, lady, was told by you: ‘Weave robe-material with this
yarn’; but master Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, said to me: ‘You, if you
please, sir, make it long and wide and rough; there will not come to be a
shortage of this yarn.’”</p>
<p>Then that woman gave a second time just as much yarn as she had given at first.
Then the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, heard it said that “The
man is come back from his journey.” Then the venerable Upananda, the son of the
Sakyans, approached <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.147" href="#BD.2.147"></a>
that man’s dwelling and having approached he sat down on the appointed seat.
Then that man approached the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, and
having approached and greeted the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans,
he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful
distance, that man said to his wife: “Is that robe-material woven?”</p>
<p>“Yes, master, that robe-material is woven.”</p>
<p>“Bring it, I will present master Upananda with robe-material.” Then that woman
bringing that robe-material and giving it to her husband, told him this matter.
Then that man, giving that robe-material to the venerable Upananda, the son of
the Sakyans, looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“These recluses, sons of the Sakyans, have great desires, they are not
contented; it is not easy to present them with robe-material. How can master
Upananda, before being invited by me, going up to a householder’s weavers, put
forward a consideration with regard to robe-material?”</p>
<p>Monks heard that man who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying: “How can the venerable Upananda, the son of the
Sakyans, before being invited, going up to a householder’s weavers, put forward
a consideration with regard to robe-material?” Then these monks told this
matter to the lord.</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Upananda, before being invited, going up to
a householder’s weavers, put forward a consideration with regard to
robe-material?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>“Is he a relation of yours, Upananda, or not a relation?”</p>
<p>“He is not a relation, lord.”</p>
<p>“Foolish man, one who is not a relation does not know what is suitable or what
is unsuitable, or what is right or what is wrong for one who is not a relation.
Thus will you, foolish man, before being invited, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.259" href="#Vin.3.259"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.148" href="#BD.2.148"></a>
going up to a householder’s weavers, put forward a consideration with regard to
robe-material. It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet)
pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">A man or a woman householder who is not a relation may cause robe-material to
be woven by weavers for a monk. Then if that monk, before being invited, going
up to the weavers, should put forward a consideration with regard to the
robe-material, saying: ‘Now sirs, this robe-material is being specially woven
for me. Make it long and wide and rough, and make it evenly woven and well
woven and well scraped and well combed. If you do so we could give the
venerable ones something or other in addition.’ And if the monk, speaking thus,
should give something or other in addition, even as little as the contents of a
begging-bowl, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>

<p><span class="term">A householder</span> means:

<p><span class="term">Robe-material</span> means:
<span class="gloss">any one robe-material of the six (kinds of) robe-material including the least

<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.149" href="#BD.2.149"></a>
<span class="term">May cause to be woven</span> means:
<span class="gloss">causes to be woven.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">If that monk</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the particular monk for whom the robe-material is being woven.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Before being invited</span> means:
<span class="gloss">before it was said (to him): ‘What kind of robe-material do you want, honoured
sir? What kind of robe-material shall I have woven for you?’</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Going up to the weavers</span> means:
<span class="gloss">going to the house, approaching (them) anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should put forward a consideration with regard to the robe-material</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he says: ‘Now sirs, this robe-material is being specially woven for me. Make it
long and wide and rough, and make it evenly woven and well woven and well
scraped and well combed. If you do so we could give the venerable ones
something or other in addition.’</span>
</p>
<p><span class="term">And if the monk, speaking thus, should give something or other in addition,
even as little as the contents of a begging-bowl</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the contents of a begging-bowl are called conjey and rice and <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.260" href="#Vin.3.260"></a>
solid food and a lump of chunam and a tooth-pick and unwoven thread, and he
even speaks <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.</span></p>
<p>If according to what he says, he makes it long or wide or rough, there is an
offence of wrong-doing in the action. It is to be forfeited on acquisition. It
should be forfeited to … an individual. And thus, monks, should it be
forfeited: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, before I was invited (to take) this robe-material, approaching
the weavers of a householder who is not a relation, I put forward a
consideration with regard to the robe-material; it is to be forfeited. I
forfeit it to the Order.’</span> …
<span class="kamma">‘… the Order should give back … let the venerable ones give back … I will give
back this robe to the venerable one.’</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.150" href="#BD.2.150"></a>
If, before being invited, going up to the weavers of a householder, thinking
that he is not a relation when he is not a relation, he puts forward a
consideration with regard to robe-material, there is an offence of expiation
involving forfeiture. If, being in doubt as to whether he is not a relation,
before being invited, going up to the weavers of a householder, he puts forward
a consideration with regard to robe-material, there is an offence of expiation
involving forfeiture. If, before being invited, going up to the weavers of a
householder, thinking that he is a relation when he is not a relation, he puts
forward a consideration with regard to robe-material, there is an offence of
expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that he is not a relation when he
is a relation, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to
whether he is a relation, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that
he is a relation when he is a relation, there is no offence.</p>
<p>There is no offence if it belongs to relations; if they are invited; if it is
for another; if it is by means of his own property; if desirous of having
costly (robe-material) woven he has (robe-material) costing little woven; if he
is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
