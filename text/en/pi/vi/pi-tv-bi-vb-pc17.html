… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
several nuns, going to Sāvatthī through the Kosalan districts, having arrived
at a certain village in the evening, having approached a certain brahmin
family, asked for accommodation. Then that brahmin woman spoke thus to these
nuns: “Wait, ladies, until the brahmin comes.” The nuns, saying: “Until the
brahmin comes!”, having spread a sleeping-place, some sat down, others lay
down. Then that brahmin having come during the night, spoke thus to that
brahmin woman: “Who are these?”</p>
<p>“They are nuns, master.”</p>
<p>Saying: “Throw out these shaven-headed strumpets,” he threw them out from the
house. Then these nuns, having arrived in Sāvatthī, told this matter to the
nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these
nuns, having approached families at the wrong time, having spread a
sleeping-place without asking the owner (for permission), sit down on it and
lie down on it?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns … lay down on it?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns, having approached families … lie down on it? It is not,
monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, having approached families at the wrong time, having spread or

on it or should lie down on it, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
