… at Vesālī in the Great Grove in the hall of the Gabled Roof. Now at that time
in Vesālī a succession of meals of sumptuous foods came to be arranged. Then it
occurred to a certain poor workman: “This will not be inferior, in that these
people duly prepare a meal. What now if I were to prepare a meal?” Then that
poor workman approached Kirapatika, and having approached, he said to
Kirapatika:</p>
<p>“I, master, want <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.76" href="#Vin.4.76"></a>
to prepare a meal for the Order of monks with the enlightened one at the head.
Give me a wage.”</p>
<p>Now Kirapatika had faith and was virtuous. Then Kirapatika gave more than a
wage to this poor work-man. Then the poor workman went up to the lord, and
having gone up, having greeted the lord, he sat down at a respectful distance.
As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the poor workman spoke thus to
the lord:</p>
<p>“Lord, may the lord, together with the Order of monks, consent to a meal with
me tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“But, sir, do find out, the Order of monks is large.”</p>
<p>“Lord, let the Order of monks be large. Many are the jujube fruits prepared by
me, the things to be <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.316" href="#BD.2.316"></a>
drunk will be perfect on account of the juice of the jujube fruits.”</p>
<p>The lord consented by becoming silent. Then that poor workman, having obtained
the lord’s consent, having risen up from the seat, having greeted the lord,
departed, keeping his right side towards him. Monks heard it said:</p>
<p>“The Order of monks, with the enlightened one at the head, is invited for
tomorrow by a poor workman. The things to be drunk will be perfect on account
of the juice of jujube fruits.” These ate, walking for alms that morning.
People heard it said: “The Order of monks, with the enlightened one at the
head, is invited by, the poor workman.” These conveyed much solid food and soft
food for the poor workman. Then that poor workman, at the end of that night,
having had sumptuous solid food and soft food prepared, had the time announced
to the lord, saying: “Lord, it is time, the meal is ready.” Then the lord,
dressing in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, approached the poor
workman’s dwelling, and having approached he sat down on the appointed seat
together with the Order of monks. Then that poor workman served the monks in a
refectory. The monks spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Sir, give a little, give a little, sir.” He said: “Do not you, honoured sirs,
accept so very little saying, ‘This is a poor workman.’ Much solid food and
soft food was prepared for me. Honoured sirs, accept as much as you please.”</p>
<p>“Sir, it is not for this reason that we accept so very little, but we ate,
having walked for alms this morning; that is why we are accepting so very
little.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.317" href="#BD.2.317"></a>
Then that poor workman looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the revered sirs, invited by me, eat elsewhere? Yet am I not competent
to give as much as they please?”</p>
<p>Monks heard this poor workman who … <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.77" href="#Vin.4.77"></a>
spread it about. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can these monks, invited somewhere, eat elsewhere?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the monks, invited somewhere, ate
elsewhere?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can these foolish men … eat elsewhere? It is not, monks … And
thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="subrule">In an out-of-turn meal, there is an offence of expiation.</span>”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.33.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.33.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.33.2.1"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.318" href="#BD.2.318"></a>
Now at that time a certain monk became ill. A monk, taking alms-food, went up
to that monk, and having gone up he spoke thus to that monk: “Eat, your
reverence.”</p>
<p>“Very well, your reverence, but there is for me the expectation of a meal.”</p>
<p>Alms-food was conveyed to that monk in the evening. That monk did not eat as
much as expected. They told this matter to the lord. Then the lord on this
occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks,
saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, when a monk is ill, to eat an out-of-turn meal. And thus,
monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="subrule">In an out-of-turn meal, except at a right time, there is an offence of
expiation. In this case, a right time is a time of illness; this is a right
time in this case.</span>”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.33.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.33.3.1" href="#Bu-Pc.33.3.1"></a>
At that time people, at the time of giving robes, having had a meal prepared
together with the robes, invited monks, saying: “Having offered food, we will
present (you) with robes.” The monks, being scrupulous, did not consent,
saying: “It is forbidden by the lord to eat an out-of-turn meal.” … <span class="add">See
<a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bu-vb-pc32#Bu-Pc.32.3">Bu-Pc.32.3</a>,
<a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bu-vb-pc32#Bu-Pc.32.4">Bu-Pc.32.4</a></span> … “… should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">In an out-of-turn meal, except at a right time, there is an offence of
expiation. In this case a right time is a time of illness, a time of giving
robes, a time of making robes; this is a right time in this case.</span>”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.33.4"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.33.4.1" href="#Bu-Pc.33.4.1"></a>
Then the lord, dressing in the morning, taking his bowl
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.78" href="#Vin.4.78"></a>
and robe, with the venerable Ānanda as his attendant, came up to a certain
household, and having <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.319" href="#BD.2.319"></a>
come up he sat down on the appointed seat. Then these people gave a meal to the
lord and to the venerable Ānanda. The venerable Ānanda, being scrupulous, did
not accept (it).</p>
<p>“Take it, Ānanda,” he said.</p>
<p>“Very well, lord, (but) there is for me the expectation of a meal.”</p>
<p>“Well now, Ānanda, having assigned it (to another), take (this food).”</p>
<p>Then the, lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned
talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, having assigned (food to another), to eat an out-of-turn
meal. And thus, monks, should it be assigned: ‘I will give the meal that I am
expecting to so and so.’”</p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.33.5.1" href="#Bu-Pc.33.5.1"></a>
<span class="term">An out-of-turn meal</span> means:
<span class="gloss">invited to any one meal of the five (kinds of) meals, having set this to one
side, if he eats any one other meal of the five (kinds of) meals, this means an

<span class="gloss">setting aside a right time.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Time of illness</span> means:

out-of-turn meal there is no offence.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.33.5.2" href="#Bu-Pc.33.5.2"></a>
There is no offence if it is at a right time; if he eats, having assigned (a
meal); if he eats two or three invitations <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.320" href="#BD.2.320"></a>
together; if he eats the invitations in succession; if invited by a whole
village he eats anywhere in that village; if invited by a whole guild he eats
anywhere in that guild; if being invited, he speaks saying: “I will take
alms-food”; if it is the regular supply of food; if it is food (allowed by)
ticket; if it is (food given) on a day of the waxing or waning of the moon; if
it is (given) on an Observance day; if it is (given) on the day after an
Observance day; setting aside the five (kinds of) meals, there is no offence in
(eating) any other; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
