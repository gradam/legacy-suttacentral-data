… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a certain caravan was desirous of going from Rājagaha to the south. A certain
monk spoke thus to these people: “I will go together with the venerable ones.”</p>
<p>“But we, honoured sir, shall evade the tax.”</p>
<p>“Do you understand (how to do so), sirs?” Then the overseers heard: “A caravan
will evade the tax.” They infested the way. Then these overseers, having seized
and ransacked that caravan, spoke thus to that monk:</p>
<p>“How is it that you, honoured sir, knowingly go together with a caravan (set
on) theft?” (and) having detained him they set him free. Then that monk, having
arrived at Sāvatthī, told this matter to the monks. Those who were modest monks
… spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can a monk, having arranged together with a caravan (set on) theft,
knowingly go along the same highroad?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monk, … knowingly went along the same high
road?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.16" href="#BD.3.16"></a>
“How can you, foolish man, having arranged together with a caravan (set on)
theft, knowingly go along the same high road? It is not, foolish man, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of
training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, having arranged together with a caravan (set on) theft, should
knowingly go along the same high road, even among villages, there is an offence
of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… monk is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">He knows</span> means:
<span class="gloss">either he knows by himself, or others tell him, or (someone) tells him.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Caravan (set on) theft</span> means:
<span class="gloss">they are thieves who have done the deed or who have not done the deed; or they
go for the robbing of kings or they evade the tax.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Together with</span> means:
<span class="gloss">together.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Having arranged</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if one arranges, saying, “We are going, reverend sir, we are going, honoured
sir, we are going, honoured sir, we are going, reverend sir, we are going
either today or tomorrow or the next day,” there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Even among villages</span> means:
<span class="gloss">in a village close enough for a cock (to walk), among every (such) village,
there is an offence of expiation. For every half yojana in what is not a
village, in the jungle, there is an offence of expiation. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.132" href="#Vin.4.132"></a>

If he thinks that a caravan is (set on) theft when the caravan is (set on)
theft, and having arranged, goes along the same high road, even among villages,
there is an <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.17" href="#BD.3.17"></a>
offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether a caravan is (set on)
theft … offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that a caravan is not (set on)
theft when the caravan is (set on) theft … no offence. If monks arrange (and)
the people do not arrange, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks
that the caravan is (set on) theft when the caravan is not (set on) theft,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether the caravan
is not (set on) theft, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that
the caravan is not (set on) theft when the caravan is not (set on) theft, there
is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.66.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.66.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if they go not having arranged; if the people arrange (and)
monks do not arrange; if they go without (making) a rendezvous; if there are
accidents; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
