… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks made one of the group of seventeen monks laugh by
tickling him with the fingers. This monk, faint and unable to get his breath,
died. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the group of six monks <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.111" href="#Vin.4.111"></a>
make a monk laugh by tickling him with the fingers?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks … with the fingers?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men … with the fingers? It is not, foolish men, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of
training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">In tickling with the fingers there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.52.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.52.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Tickling with the fingers</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if one who is ordained desiring to make laugh one who is ordained, rubs the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.388" href="#BD.2.388"></a>
body with the body, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

If he thinks that he is ordained when he is ordained, (and) makes him laugh by
tickling with the fingers, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt
as to whether he is ordained … If he thinks that he is not ordained when he is
ordained … an offence of expiation. If he rubs something attached to the body
with the body, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he rubs the body with
something attached to the body … wrong-doing. If he rubs something attached to
the body with something attached to the body … wrong-doing. If he rubs the body
with something that may be cast, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he rubs
something attached to the body with something that may be cast … wrong-doing.
If he rubs something that may be cast with something that may be cast, there is
an offence of wrong-doing. If he rubs the body of one who is not ordained with
the body, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he rubs something attached to
the body with the body … the body with something attached to the body …
something attached to the body with something attached to the body … the body
with something that may be cast … something attached to the body with something
that may be cast … something that may be cast with something that may be cast,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that he is ordained when he is
not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to
whether he is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks
that he is not ordained when he is not ordained, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</p>

There is no offence if, not desiring laughter, he rubs (him) if there is
something to be done; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
