At that time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta
Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six nuns,
having had ghee asked for, partook of it. People … spread it about, saying:
“How can these nuns, having had ghee asked for, partake of it? Who does not
like well cooked things? Who does not like sweet things?” Nuns heard these
people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about,
saying: “How can this group of six nuns, having had ghee asked for, partake of
it?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six nuns, having had ghee
asked for, partook of it?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the group of six nuns …? It is not, monks, for pleasing those
who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p><span class="subrule">“Whatever nun, having had ghee asked for, should partake of it, it should be
confessed by that nun, saying: ‘I have fallen, ladies, into a blameworthy
matter, un-becoming, which ought to be confessed; I confess it.’”</span></p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for nuns came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pd.1.1.2" href="#Bi-Pd.1.1.2"></a>
Now at that time nuns came to be ill. Nuns enquiring after the ill ones, spoke
thus to the ill nuns: “We <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.420" href="#BD.3.420"></a>
hope, ladies, that you are better, we hope that you are keeping going.”</p>
<p>“Formerly, ladies, we, having had ghee asked for, partook of it, thus there
came to be comfort for us. But now it is forbidden by the lord and, being
scrupulous, we do not have it asked for, thus there does not come to be comfort
for us.” They told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“I allow, monks, an ill nun, having had ghee asked for, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.347" href="#Vin.4.347"></a>
to partake of it. And thus, monks, let the nuns set forth this rule of
training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun who is not ill, having had ghee asked for, should partake of it,
it should be confessed by that nun, saying: ‘I have fallen, ladies, into a
blameworthy matter, unbecoming, which ought to be confessed; I confess it.’”</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bi-Pd.1.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pd.1.2.1" href="#Bi-Pd.1.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Not ill</span> means:
<span class="gloss">for whom there comes to be comfort without ghee.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Ill</span> means:
<span class="gloss">for whom there does not come to be comfort without ghee.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Ghee</span> means:
<span class="gloss">ghee from cows or ghee from she-goats or ghee from buffaloes, ghee from those
whose meat is allowable.</span></p>
<p>If she is not ill (and) has it asked for for herself, in the request there is
an offence of wrong-doing. If she accepts, thinking: “I will partake of it on
acquisition,” there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful there is
an offence which ought to be confessed.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pd.1.2.2" href="#Bi-Pd.1.2.2"></a>
If she thinks that she is not ill when she is not ill (and) having had ghee
asked for partakes of it, there is an offence which ought to be confessed. If
she is in doubt as to whether she is not ill … If she thinks that she is ill
when she is not ill … offence which ought to be <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.421" href="#BD.3.421"></a>
confessed. If she thinks that she is not ill when she is ill, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether she is ill, there is
an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is ill when she is ill, there
is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pd.1.2.3" href="#Bi-Pd.1.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she is ill; if having been ill (and) having had it asked
for she partakes of it when she is not ill, if she eats the remainder of an ill
nun’s meal; if it belongs to relations; if they are invited; if it is for
another; if it is by means of her own property; if she is mad, if she is the
first wrong-doer.</p>
