… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the nun Caṇḍakalī, having quarrelled with the nuns, wept having struck herself
again and again. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can
the lady Caṇḍakalī weep, having struck herself again and again?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Caṇḍakalī wept, having struck
herself again and again?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Caṇḍakalī weep, having struck herself again and again?
It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of
training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should weep, having struck herself again and again, there is an
offence of expiation.” </span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Herself</span> means:
<span class="gloss">herself (individually).</span></p>
<p>If she weeps, having struck herself again and again, there is an offence of
expiation. If she strikes, (but) does not weep, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If she weeps, (but) does not strike, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.20.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.20.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if, smitten by loss of relations or by
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.282" href="#BD.3.282"></a>
loss of possessions or by loss of health, she weeps (but) does not strike; if
she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
