… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the nun Thullanandā came to be ill. Then a certain lay-follower approached the
nun Thullanandā, and having approached he spoke thus to the nun Thullanandā:
“What, lady, is your discomfort? What may be brought (for you)?”</p>
<p>“Sir, I am in need of ghee.”</p>
<p>Then that lay-follower, having for a <i lang="pi">kahāpaṇa</i> brought ghee from the house of a certain shopkeeper, gave it to the nun
Thullanandā. The nun Thullanandā said: “I am not in need of ghee, sir, I am in
need of oil.” Then that lay-follower approached that shopkeeper, and having
approached he spoke thus to that shopkeeper:</p>
<p>“The lady says that she does not need ghee, master, she needs oil. You take the
ghee (and) give me the oil.”</p>
<p>“If we, master, take back again goods that were bought, when will our goods be
sold? Ghee was taken owing to the purchase of ghee; give for the purchase of
oil (and) you shall take oil”</p>
<p>Then that lay-follower … spread it about, saying: “How can this lady
Thullanandā, having had one thing asked for, then have another thing asked
for?” Nuns heard this lay-follower who … spread it about. Those who were modest
nuns … spread it about … Then these nuns told this matter to the monks. The
monks … to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thulla <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.224" href="#BD.3.224"></a>
nandā, having had one thing asked for, had another thing asked for?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.249" href="#Vin.4.249"></a>
the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … have another thing asked for? It is not,
monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, having had one thing asked for, should have another thing asked
for, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bi-NP.4.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-NP.4.2.1" href="#Bi-NP.4.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Nun</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Having had one thing asked for</span> means:
<span class="gloss">having had anything whatever asked for.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should have another asked for</span> means:
<span class="gloss">excepting that (thing), if she has another asked for, in the request there is
an offence of wrong-doing. It is to be forfeited on acquisition. It should be
forfeited to an Order or to a group or to one nun. And thus, monks, should it
be forfeited: “Ladies, having had this thing asked for, the other thing asked
for is to be forfeited by me. I forfeit it to the Order.” … “… the Order should
give back … let the ladies give back … I will give back (this thing) to the
lady.”</span></p>

If she thinks that one thing is another thing and has the other thing asked
for, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If she is in doubt
as to whether one thing … If she thinks that an identical thing is another
thing … offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If she thinks that another
thing is an identical thing (and) has the identical thing asked for, there is
an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether it is an identical
thing (and) has an identical thing asked for, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If she thinks that it is an identical thing when it is an
identical thing, there is no offence.</p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-NP.4.2.3" href="#Bi-NP.4.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she has that thing asked for and also has another thing
asked for; if having pointed out the advantage, she has it asked for; if she is
mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
