… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a certain nun’s robe of costly robe-cloth was badly made, badly sewn. The nun
Thullanandā <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.280" href="#Vin.4.280"></a>
spoke thus to that nun: “Lady, this robe-cloth of yours is lovely, but the robe
is badly made, badly sewn.”</p>
<p>“If I unsew it, lady, will you sew it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, lady, I will sew it.”</p>
<p>Then that nun, having unsewn that robe, gave it to the nun Thullanandā. The nun
Thullanandā, thinking: “I will sew it, I will sew it,” neither sewed it nor
made an effort to get it sewn. Then that nun told this matter to the nuns.
Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the lady
Thullanandā, having had a nun’s robe unsewn, neither sew it nor make an effort
to get it sewn?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the Thullanandā, having had a nun’s robe
unsewn, neither sewed it nor made an effort to get it sewn?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … nor make an effort to get it sewn? It is
not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of
training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, having unsewn or having made (another) unsew a nun’s robe, if she
is not afterwards prevented should neither sew it nor should make an effort to
get it sewn, except on the fourth and fifth days, there is an offence of
expiation.”</span></p>

If she thinks that she is ordained when she is ordained, having unsewn or
having made (another) unsew a robe, and if she is not afterwards prevented,
neither sews it nor makes an effort to get it sewn, except on the fourth and
fifth days, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as to whether
she is ordained … If she thinks that she is not ordained when she is ordained …
offence of expiation. If, having unsewn or having made (another) unsew another
requisite … except on the fourth and fifth days, there is an offence <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.281" href="#Vin.4.281"></a>
of wrong-doing. If, having unsewn or made (another) unsew a robe or another
requisite of one who is not ordained … except on the fourth and fifth days,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is ordained when she
is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to
whether she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks
that she is not ordained when she is not ordained, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</p>

<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.289" href="#BD.3.289"></a>
There is no offence if there is an obstacle; if, having looked about, she does
not get the chance; if she, working, lets the fourth and fifth days pass; if
she is ill; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first
wrong-doer.</p>
