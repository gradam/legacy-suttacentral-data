… at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding place. And then
Devadatta came up to Kokālika, and to Kaṭamorakatissaka, and to the son of the
lady Khaṇḍā, and to Samuddadatta, and having eome up he said to Kokālika,
Kaṭamorakatissaka, and the son of the lady Khaṇḍā, and to Samuddadatta: “Now
we, your reverences, will make a schism in the Order of the recluse Gotama, a
breaking of the concord.”</p>
<p>When he had spoken thus Kokālika said to Devadatta: “Your reverence, the
recluse Gotama has great psychic power, and great might. How can we make a
schism in the Order of the recluse Gotama, a breaking of the concord?”</p>
<p>“Now we, your reverence, having approached the recluse Gotama, will beg for
five items: ‘Lord, the lord in many ways speaks in praise of desiring little,
of being contented, of expunging (evil), of being punctilious, of whatis
gracious, of decrease (of the obstructions), of putting forth energy. Lord,
these five items are conducive in many ways to desiring little, to contentment,
to expunging (evil), to being punctilious, to what is gracious, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.297" href="#BD.1.297"></a>
to decrease (of the obstruction), to putting forth energy.</p>
<ol>
<li>It were good, lord, if the monks for as long as life lasted, should be
forest-dwellers; whoever should betake himself to the neighbourhood of a
village, sin would besmirch him.</li>
<li>For as long as life lasts let them be beggars for alms; whoever should accept
an invitation, sin would besmirch him.</li>
<li>For as long as life lasts let them be wearers of robes taken from the
dust-heap; whoever should accept a robe given by a householder, sin would
besmirch him.</li>
<li>For as long as life lasts let them live at the foot of a tree; whoever should
go under cover, sin would besmirch him.</li>
<li>For as long as life lasts let them not eat fish and flesh; whoever should eat
fish and flesh, sin would besmirch him.”</li>
</ol>
<p>“The recluse Gotama will not allow these things. Then we will win over the
people by means of these five items.”</p>
<p>“It is possible, your reverence, with these five items, to make a schism in the
Order of the recluse Gotama, a breaking of the concord. For, your reverence,
people esteem austerity.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.10.1.2" href="#Bu-Ss.10.1.2"></a>
Then Devadatta together with his friends went up to the lord, and having gone
up and greeted the lord, he sat down to one side. As he was sitting to one
side, Devadatta said to the lord: “Lord, the lord in many <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.298" href="#BD.1.298"></a>
ways speaks in praise of desiring little … who should eat fish or flesh, sin
would besmirch him.”</p>
<p>“Enough, Devadatta,” he said. “Whoever wishes, let him be a forest-dweller;
whoever wishes, let him dwell in the neighbourhood of a village; whoever
wishes, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.172" href="#Vin.3.172"></a>
let him be a beggar for alms; whoever wishes, let him accept an invitation;
whoever wishes, let him wear rags taken from the dust-heap; whoever wishes, let
him accept a householder’s robes. For eight months, Devadatta, lodging at the
foot of a tree is permitted by me. Fish and flesh are pure in respect of three
points: if they are not seen, heard or suspected (to have been killed for
him).”</p>
<p>Then Devadatta thinking: “The lord does not allow these five items,” was joyful
and exultant. He rose from his seat, and having greeted the lord, and paid
homage to him keeping him on his right side, he departed together with his
friends. Then Devadatta, entering Rājagaha, taught the people by means of the
five items: “We, your reverences, having approached the recluse Gotama, begged
for five items: ‘Lord, the lord in various ways speaks in praise of desiring
little … whoever should eat fish and flesh, sin would besmirch him.’ The
recluse Gotama does not <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.299" href="#BD.1.299"></a>
allow these. But we live in conformity with these five items.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.10.1.3" href="#Bu-Ss.10.1.3"></a>
Then those who were men of no faith, not virtuous, and of poor enlightenment,
said: “These recluses, sons of the Sakyans, are punctilious and practise the
expunging of evil; but the recluse Gotama is luxurious and strives after
abundance.”</p>
<p>Then those who were faithful, virtuous, clever, enlightened people became
vexed, annoyed, angry and said: “How can this Devadatta go forward with a
schism in the Order of the lord, with a breaking of the concord?”</p>
<p>Then the monks heard these people who were vexed, annoyed, angry. Those who
were modest monks were … angry, and said: “How can this Devadatta go forward
with a schism, with a breaking of the concord?” Then these monks told this
matter to the lord.</p>
<p>He said: “Is it true, as is said, Devadatta, that you went forward with a
schism in the Order, with a breaking of the concord?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying: “How can you, foolish man,
go forward with a schism in the Order, with a breaking of the concord? It is
not, foolish man, for the benefit of unbelievers … Thus, monks, this course of
training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should go forward with a schism of the Order which is harmonious,
or should persist in taking up some legal question leading to a dissension:
that monk should be spoken to thus by the monks: <span class="kamma">‘Do not, venerable one, go forward with a schism of the Order which is
harmonious, or persist in taking up some legal question leading to a
dissension. Let the venerable <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.300" href="#BD.1.300"></a>
one be associated with the Order; for the Order is harmonious, on friendly
terms, not quarrelsome, it dwells comfortably under a single rule.’</span> And if that monk, after he has been spoken to thus by the monks,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.173" href="#Vin.3.173"></a>
should persist, that monk should be admonished up to three times by the monks
together concerning his giving up such a course. Should he give it up after
being admonished up to three times, this is good. Should he not give it up,
there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Ss.10.2"></a>

<p><span class="term">Monk</span> means:

<p><span class="term">Harmonious</span> means:
<span class="gloss">an Order belonging to the same community is established within the same
boundary.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should go forward with a schism</span> means:
<span class="gloss">saying, “How should these folk be separated, how should they be separated, how
should they be at variance?” seeking a faction, he gets a group together.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">A legal question leading to a dissension</span> means:

<span class="gloss">should not give up.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">That monk</span> means:
<span class="gloss">that schismatic monk.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">By the monks</span> means:
<span class="gloss">by other monks, whoever see, whoever hear; these should say:
<span class="kamma">“Do not, venerable one, go forward with a schism of the Order which is
harmonious, nor persist in taking up a legal question leading to a dissension.
Let the venerable one be associated with the Order. The Order, harmonious, on
friendly terms, not quarrelsome, dwells comfortably under a single rule.”</span> A second time they should say … A third time they should say … If he gives it
up, this is good. If he does not give it up, it is an offence of wrong-doing.
If having heard, they do not speak, there is an offence of wrong-doing. That
monk, having been pulled to the middle of the Order, they are to say: <span class="kamma">“Do not, venerable one, go forward with a schism of the Order, which is
harmonious, nor persist in taking up a legal question leading to a dissension.
Let the venerable one be associated with the Order. The Order, harmonious …
comfortably under a single rule.”</span> A second time they should say … A third time they should say … If he gives it
up, that is good. If he does not give it up, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">That monk should be admonished</span>.
<span class="gloss">Thus, monks, should he be admonished: the Order should be informed by an
experienced, competent monk: <span class="kamma">“Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This monk, so and so, proceeds with
a schism of the Order which is harmonious. He does not give up this course. If
it is the right time for the Order, let the Order admonish this monk, so and
so, so that he may give up his course. This is the motion. Honoured sirs, let
the Order hear me. This monk, so and so … does not give up his course. The
Order <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.174" href="#Vin.3.174"></a>
together admonishes the monk, so and so, that he may give up his course. If it
seems good to the venerable ones, together admonishing this monk, so and so,
that he should give up his course, be silent; if it does not seem good, then
you should speak. A second time I speak this matter … A third time <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.302" href="#BD.1.302"></a>
I speak this matter … then you should speak. It has been said by the Order that
the monk, so and so, should give up his course. It seems good to the Order …
Thus do I understand.”</span></span></p>
<p>According to the motion there is an offence of wrong-doing; according to the
two resolutions there are grave offences; according to the end of a resolution
there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order. If he is
committing an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order, the offence of
wrong-doing according to the motion and the grave offences according to the two
resolutions, subside.</p>
<p><span class="term">An offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… because of this it is called an offence entailing a formal meeting of the
Order.</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Ss.10.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.10.3.1" href="#Bu-Ss.10.3.1"></a>
Thinking a legally valid act to be a legally valid act, he does not give it up,
there is au offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order. Being in doubt as
to whether it is a legally valid act, he does not give it up, there is an
offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order. Thinking an act which is not
legally valid to be an act which is legally valid, he does not give it up,
there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order. Thinking an act
which is legally valid to be an act which is not legally valid, is an offence
of wrong-doing. Being in doubt as to whether it is not a legally valid act, is
an offence of wrong-doing. Not thinking an act which is legally valid to be an
act which is not legally valid, is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>

<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.303" href="#BD.1.303"></a>
There is no offence if he has not been admonished, if he gives it up, if he is
mad, out of his mind, in pain, a beginner.</p>
