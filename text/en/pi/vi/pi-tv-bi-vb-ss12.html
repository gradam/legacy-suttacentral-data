… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
nuns who were pupils of the nun Thullanandā lived in company, they were of evil
habits, of evil repute, of evil ways of living, vexing the Order of nuns,
concealing one another’s sins. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about,
saying: “How can these nuns live in company … concealing one another’s sins?”
…</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns live in company … concealing one
another’s sins?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns live in company … concealing one another’s sins?</p>
<p>It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … let the nuns
set forth this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">In case nuns live in company, of evil habits, of evil repute, of evil ways of
living, vexing the Order of nuns, concealing one another’s sins, those nuns
should be spoken to thus by the nuns: ‘Sisters are living in company … <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.208" href="#BD.3.208"></a>
concealing one another’s sins. Let the ladies desist; the Order praises this
detachment in sisters.’ But if these nuns, being spoken to thus by the nuns,
should persist as before, these nuns should be admonished by the nuns up to the
third time for giving up that (course). If, being admonished up to the third
time they should give it up, that is good. If they should not give it up, these
nuns also have fallen into a matter that is an offence on the third
(admonition), entailing a formal meeting of the Order involving being sent
away.</span>”</p>

<p><span class="term">Vexing the Order of nuns</span> means:
<span class="gloss"> <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.240" href="#Vin.4.240"></a>
they protest when a (formal) act is being carried out against each other.</span></p>

<span class="kamma">“Sisters are living in company … detachment in sisters.”</span> And a second time they should be told. And a third time they should be told …
<span class="add">see
<a class="cr" href="#Bi-Ss.10.2.1">Bi-Ss.10.2.1</a>.
<em>Instead of</em> Do not, ladies, angry,
<em>etc., read</em> Sisters are living in company,
<em>etc.; instead of</em> that nun … does not give up that course
<em>read</em> those nuns … do not give up that course;
<em>instead of</em>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.209" href="#BD.3.209"></a>
this nun so and so
<em>read</em> these nuns so and so and so and so are living in company … they do not give up
that course … the nuns so and so and so and so should be admonished … are
admonished for giving up that course</span> … If they are committing an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order,
the offence of wrong-doing according to the motion and the grave offences
according to the two proclamations, subside.</span></p>
<p>Two or three should be admonished together. More than that should not be
admonished together.</p>
<p><span class="term">These nuns also</span> means:
<span class="gloss">they are so called in reference to the former.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Up to the third time</span> means:
<span class="gloss">they fall on the third admonition, not through transgression of a course.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Involving being sent away</span> means:
<span class="gloss">they are caused to be sent away from the Order,</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… therefore again it is called an offence entailing a formal meeting of the
Order.</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Ss.12.2.2" href="#Bi-Ss.12.2.2"></a>
If they think that it is a legally valid act when it is a legally valid act
(and) do not give up … <span class="add">see <a class="cr" href="#Bi-Ss.10.2.2">Bi-Ss.10.2.2</a></span> … If they think that it is not a legally valid act when it is not a legally
valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Ss.12.2.3" href="#Bi-Ss.12.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if they are not admonished; if they give it up; if they are
mad, if they are the first wrong-doers.</p>
