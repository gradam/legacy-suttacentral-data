“What is the forerunner of a legal question concerning disputes?” Greed is a forerunner, hatred is a forerunner, confusion is a forerunner, lack of greed … lack of hatred … lack of confusion is a forerunner. “How many are the causal occasions?” There are eighteen causal occasions that are matters making for schism. “How many matters?” There are eighteen matters that are matters making for schism. “How many grounds?” There are eighteen grounds that are grounds making for schism. “How many causes?” Nine causes: three causes that are skilled, three causes that are unskilled, three causes that are indeterminate. “How many roots?” Twelve roots. “By how many modes does one dispute?” One disputes by two modes: either the view that it is <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> or the view that it is non-<i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. “By how many decidings is a legal question concerning disputes stopped?” A legal question concerning disputes is stopped by two decidings: by a verdict in the presence of and by the decision of the majority.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.5.7.4" href="#Prv.5.7.4"></a>
“What is the forerunner of a legal question concerning offences?” … non-confusion is a forerunner. “How many are the causal occasions?” The seven classes of offence are causal occasions. “How many matters?” The seven classes of offence are matters. “How many grounds?” The seven classes of offence are grounds. “How many causes?” Nine causes … three causes that are indeterminate. “How many roots?” The six origins of offences are roots. “By how many modes … ?” By six modes one falls into an offence: through being shameless, through ignorance, through being scrupulous by nature, through thinking it is allowable when it is not allowable, through thinking it is not allowable when it is allowable, through confusion of mindfulness. “By how many decidings is a legal question concerning offences stopped?” … it is stopped by three decidings: by a verdict in the presence of and by a carrying out on (his) acknowledgement and by a covering over (as) with grass.</p>

How many are the decidings? Seven decidings: a verdict in the presence of, a verdict of innocence, a verdict of past insanity, a carrying out on (his) acknowledgement, the decision of the majority, the decision for specific depravity, a covering over (as) with grass. These seven decidings. Might it be that these seven decidings become ten decidings, that ten decidings become seven decidings according to the presentation of the matter? It might be. How can it be? There are two decidings of a legal question concerning disputes, four decidings of a legal question concerning censure, three decidings of a legal question concerning offences, one deciding of a legal question concerning obligations. Thus these seven decidings become ten decidings, the ten decidings become seven decidings according to the presentation of the matter.</p>

What is the reason for this? Was it not said by the Lord: “There are, monks, these four legal questions and seven decidings. Legal questions are settled by decidings; decidings are settled by legal questions. Thus these things are associated, not dissociated, and it is not possible … to point to a difference between them.”</p>
