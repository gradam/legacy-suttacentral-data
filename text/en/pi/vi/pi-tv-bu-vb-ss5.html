… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. At that time the
venerable Udāyin was dependent on families at Sāvatthī, and he approached many
families. When he saw a youth not (yet) a husband, or a young girl without a
husband, he spoke in praise of the girl in the presence of the youth’s parents,
saying: “The young girl of that family is beautiful, good to look upon, lovely,
she is learned, accomplished, wise, clever, energetic. This young girl is
suitable for that youth.”</p>
<p>These said: “They do not know us, honoured sir, nor who we are, nor to whom we
belong. If, honoured sir, the master will induce them to give, we might convey
this girl to this youth.”</p>
<p>He spoke in praise of the youth in the presence of the girl’s parents, saying:
“The youth of that family is beautiful, good to look upon, lovely, he is
learned, accomplished, wise, clever, energetic. That young girl is suitable for
this youth.”</p>
<p>They said: “They do not know us, honoured sir, nor who we are, nor to whom we
belong, nor in what, as it were, is the girl’s property. But if, honoured sir,
the master would beg, we might give this girl to that youth.”</p>
<p>By this means he brought about the leading of the bridegroom (to the bride’s
home), he brought about the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.230" href="#BD.1.230"></a>
leading away (from the bride’s home), he caused marriages to take place.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.5.1.2" href="#Bu-Ss.5.1.2"></a>
Now at that time the daughter of a certain woman who was formerly a courtesan
was beautiful, good to look upon, lovely. Some disciples of Naked Ascetics
coming from a distant village, said to the courtesan: “Lady, give this girl to
our boy!”</p>
<p>She said: “Masters, I do not know you, nor who these are, nor to whom he
belongs; and I will not give my only daughter to go to a distant village.”</p>
<p>Some people said to these disciples of Naked Ascetics: “Masters, why did you
come?”</p>
<p>“Now we, masters, begged that courtesan for her daughter for our son; and she
said, ‘But, masters, I do not know you, nor who these are, nor to whom he
belongs, and I will not give my only daughter to go to a distant village.’”</p>
<p>“Master, why did you beg the courtesan for her daughter? Certainly master
Udāyin should be told, master Udāyin will induce her to give (her daughter).”</p>
<p>Then these <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.136" href="#Vin.3.136"></a>
disciples of Naked Ascetics approached the venerable Udāyin, and having
approached him, they said to the venerable Udāyin: “Now, honoured sir, we
begged that courtesan … ‘distant village.’ It would be good, honoured sir, if
the master could induce this courtesan to give her daughter to our boy.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Udāyin approached that courtesan, and having approached, he
said to that courtesan: “Why did you not give your daughter to these
(people)?”</p>
<p>“But, master, I do not know them, nor who they are, nor to whom he belongs, and
I will not give my only daughter to go to a distant village.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.231" href="#BD.1.231"></a>
“Give her to them, I know them.”</p>
<p>“If, honoured sir, the master knows them, I will give (her),” she said. Then
this courtesan gave her daughter to these disciples of Naked Ascetics.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.5.1.3" href="#Bu-Ss.5.1.3"></a>
Then these disciples of Naked Ascetics, taking the young girl, for a month made
use of her according to her lot as a daughter-in-law; then afterwards they made
use of her according to her lot as a female slave. Then this young girl
dispatched a messenger to her mother, saying: “I am wretched, I am miserable, I
get no happiness. For a month they made use of me according to my lot as a
daughter-in-law, now after that they are making use of me according to my lot
as a female slave. Let my mother come for me, let her take me away.”</p>
<p>Then the courtesan came up to the disciples of Naked Ascetics, and having come
up, she said to these disciples of Naked Ascetics, “Masters, do not make use of
this young girl according to her lot as a female slave, make use of this young
girl according to her lot as a daughter-in-law.”</p>
<p>They said: “We do not want anything to do with you, we want to have to do
(only) with a recluse. You go away, we do not know you.”</p>
<p>Then this courtesan, being reproached by these followers of the Naked Ascetics,
returned again to Sāvatthī. A second time this young girl dispatched a
messenger to her mother, saying: “I am wretched … take me away.” Then the
courtesan approached the venerable Udāyin, and having approached him, she said
to the venerable Udāyin:</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, it is said that the young girl is wretched, miserable, she gets
no happiness. For a month they <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.232" href="#BD.1.232"></a>
made use of her according to her lot as a daughter-in-law, and now after that
they are making use of her according to her lot as a female slave. Honoured
sir, do say: ‘Masters, do not make use of this young girl according to her lot
as a female slave, make use of this young girl according to her lot as a
daughter-in-law.’”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Udāyin approached these disciples of the Naked Ascetics, and
having approached them, he said to these disciples of the Naked Ascetics:</p>
<p>“Masters, do not make use of this young girl according to her lot as a female
slave, make use of this young girl according to her lot as a daughter-in-law.”</p>
<p>They said: “We do not want anything to do with you; we want to have to do
(only) with the courtesan. A recluse should be without occupation, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.137" href="#Vin.3.137"></a>
the recluse will become a model recluse. You go away, we do not know you.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Udāyin having been reproached by these disciples of Naked
Ascetics, returned again to Sāvatthī. For a third time the young girl
dispatched a messenger to her mother, saying: “I am wretched, take me away.”
For a second time the courtesan approached the venerable Udāyin … “… Do say:
‘Masters … as a daughter-in-law.’”</p>
<p>He said: “When I went before, I was reproached by these disciples of the Naked
Ascetics. Go yourself. I will not go.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.5.1.4" href="#Bu-Ss.5.1.4"></a>
Then the courtesan became annoyed, vexed, angry and said: “May this master
Udāyin be wretched, may this master Udāyin be miserable, may this <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.233" href="#BD.1.233"></a>
master Udāyin not find happiness, even as my girl is wretched, miserable, and
finds no happiness because of her evil mother-in-law, because of her evil
father-in-law, because.of her evil husband.” And then the young girl became
annoyed, vexed, angry, saying: “May this master Udāyin be wretched, may this
master Udāyin be miserable, may this master Udāyin not find happiness, even as
I am wretched, miserable and find no happiness because of my evil
mother-in-law, because of my evil father-in-law, because of my evil husband.”</p>
<p>Even other women, unhappy with their mothers-in-law, unhappy with their
fathers-in-law, unhappy with their husbands, denounced him, thus: “May … be
wretched … even as we are wretched, miserable, and find no happiness because of
our evil mothers-in-law, because of our evil fathers-in-law, because of our
evil husbands.”</p>
<p>But those women who were happy with their mothers-in-law, with their
fathers-in-law, and with their husbands, these prayed to him thus: “May this
master Udāyin be happy, may this master Udāyin be blest, may this master Udāyin
prosper, even as we are happy, blest and do prosper because of our good
mothers-in-law, because of our good fathers-in-law, because of our good
husbands.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.5.1.5" href="#Bu-Ss.5.1.5"></a>
The monks heard some women denouncing, some women praying. Then those who were
modest monks became annoyed, vexed, angry and said: “How can the venerable
Udāyin act as a go-between?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord.
Then the lord on this occasion, for this reason, having had the company of
monks convened, questioned the venerable Udāyin, saying:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.234" href="#BD.1.234"></a>
“Is it true, as is said, Udāyin, that you acted as a go-between?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>Then the enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying: “How could you,
foolish man, act as a go-between? That is not, foolish man, for the benefit of
unbelievers … Thus, monks, this course of training should be set forth: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.138" href="#Vin.3.138"></a>
</p>
<p><span class="subrule">“Whatever monk should act as a go-between for a woman with a man in mind or for
a man with a woman in mind, whether as a wife or as a mistress, that is an
offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.”</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Ss.5.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.5.2.1" href="#Bu-Ss.5.2.1"></a>
At one time many men of abandoned life who were amusing themselves in a
pleasure grove, sent a messenger to a harlot to say, “Come, we will enjoy
ourselves in the pleasure grove.”</p>
<p>She said: “Masters, I do not know you, nor who you are, nor to whom you belong;
and I have many goods, I am well-to-do, and I will not go outside the city.”
Then the messenger told this matter to the men of abandoned life. A certain man
said to these men of abandoned life:</p>
<p>“Masters, why do you beg this harlot? Surely master Udāyin should be told.
Master Udāyin will procure (her for you).”</p>
<p>When he had spoken thus, a certain lay-follower said to that man: “Do not speak
like that, master; it is not right for recluses, sons of the Sakyans, to act
like that. Master Udāyin will not do it.”</p>
<p>When he had spoken thus, they said, “Will he do it, or won’t he do it?” and
they made a bet. Then these men of abandoned life approached the venerable
Udāyin, and having approached him they said to the venerable Udāyin:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.235" href="#BD.1.235"></a>
“Now we, honoured sir, amusing ourselves in the pleasure grove, sent a
messenger to some harlot, saying, ‘Come, we will enjoy ourselves in the
pleasure grove’ She said: ‘Masters, I do not know you, nor who you are, nor to
whom you belong; and I have many goods, I am well-to-do, and I will not go
outside the city.’ It would be good, honoured sir, if the master would procure
this harlot (for us).”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Udāyin went up to this harlot, and having come up he said to
this harlot: “Why do you not go among these (men)?”</p>
<p>“Master, I do not know them … I will not go outside the city.”</p>
<p>“Go among them,” he said, “I know them.”</p>
<p>“If, honoured sir, the master knows them, I will go.”</p>
<p>Then these men of abandoned life, taking this harlot, went to the pleasure
grove.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.5.2.2" href="#Bu-Ss.5.2.2"></a>
Then that lay-follower became annoyed, vexed, angry, saying: “How can master
Udāyin act as a go-between for a temporary wife?” The monks heard that
lay-follower who was annoyed, vexed, angry. Those who were modest monks became
annoyed, vexed, angry, saying: “How can the venerable Udāyin act as a
go-between for a temporary wife?” Then these monks <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.139" href="#Vin.3.139"></a>
told this matter to the lord.</p>
<p>“Is it true, as they say, Udāyin, that you acted as a go-between for a
temporary wife?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying: “How can you, foolish man,
act as a go-between for a temporary wife? It is not, foolish man, for the
benefit of unbelievers … Thus, monks, this course of training should be set
forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should act as a go-between for a woman with a man in mind, or for
a man with a woman <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.236" href="#BD.1.236"></a>
in mind whether as a wife or as a mistress or even as a temporary wife, there
is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.”</span></p>
