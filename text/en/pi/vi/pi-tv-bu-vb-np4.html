… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the former wife of the venerable Udāyin had gone forth among the nuns. She
frequently came to the venerable Udāyin, and the venerable Udāyin frequently
went to this nun. Now at that time the venerable Udāyin used to participate in
a meal with this nun. Then the venerable Udāyin, dressing in the morning,
taking his bowl and robe, approached this nun, and having approached and
disclosed his private parts in front of this nun, he sat down on a seat. And
further, the nun having disclosed her private parts in front of the venerable
Udāyin, sat down on a seat. Then the venerable Udāyin, impassioned, looked at
and thought about this nun’s private parts and emitted semen. Then the
venerable Udāyin said to this nun:</p>
<p>“Go, sister, fetch water, I will wash the inner robe.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.206" href="#Vin.3.206"></a>
</p>
<p>“Give it (to me), master, I will wash it myself,” and she took hold of one part
with her mouth and placed one part on her private parts. Because of this she
conceived a child. The nuns spoke thus:</p>
<p>“This nun is one who does not lead the Brahma-life, (because) she is pregnant.”</p>
<p>(She, sayin,) “Ladies, I am not one who does not lead the Brahma-life,” told
this matter to the nuns.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.31" href="#BD.2.31"></a>
The nuns looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can master Udāyin get a soiled robe washed by a nun?” Then these nuns told
this matter to the monks. Those who were modest monks looked down upon,
criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the venerable Udāyin get a soiled robe washed by a nun?” Then these
monks told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Udāyin, got a soiled robe washed by a nun?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>“Was she a relation of yours, Udāyin, or not a relation?”</p>
<p>“She was not a relation, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>“Foolish man, one who is not a relation does not know what is suitable or what
is unsuitable, or what is pleasant or what is unpleasant for a woman who is not
a relation. Thus you, foolish man, will get a soiled robe washed by a nun who
is not a relation. It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet)
pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should get a soiled robe washed or dyed or beaten by a nun who is
not a relation, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>

<p><span class="term">Wash</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he gives an order—there is an offence of wrong-doing. If washed, it is to be
forfeited.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Dye</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he gives an order—there is an offence of wrong-doing. If dyed, it is to be
forfeited.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Beat</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he gives an order—there is an offence of wrong-doing. If once having given a
blow with the palm (of the hand) or a blow with a club, it is to be forfeited.
It should be forfeited to the Order, or to a group, or to an individual. And
thus, monks, should it be forfeited: ‘Honoured sirs, this soiled robe which I
had washed by a nun who is not a relation, is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to
the Order.’ … ‘… the Order should give back … let the venerable ones give back
… I will give back this robe to the venerable one.’” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.207" href="#Vin.3.207"></a>
