… in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks ate
shaking the hands about. … “…</p>
<p>‘I will not eat shaking the hands about,’ is a training to be observed.”</p>
<p>One should not eat shaking the hands about. Whoever out of disrespect eats
shaking the hands about, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>There is no offence if it is unintentional, if he is not thinking, if he does
not know, if he is ill, if he shakes the hands about getting rid of the crumbs,
if there are accidents, if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
