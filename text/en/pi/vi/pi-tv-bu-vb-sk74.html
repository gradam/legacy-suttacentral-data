… in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks eased
themselves and spat on green corn … “…</p>
<p>‘I will not ease myself or spit, if not ill, on green corn,’ is a training to
be observed.”</p>
<p>One should not ease oneself or spit, if not ill, on green corn. Whoever out of
disrespect eases himself or spits, if not ill, on green corn, there is an
offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>There is no offence if it is unintentional, if he is not thinking, if he does
not know, if he is ill, if done where there is no green corn he spreads green
corn over it, if <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.151" href="#BD.3.151"></a>
there are accidents, if he is mad, if he is the first wrongdoer.</p>
