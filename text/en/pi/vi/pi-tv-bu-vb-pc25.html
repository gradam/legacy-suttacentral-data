… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a monk was walking for alms in Sāvatthī along a certain road. And a nun was
walking for alms along that road. Then that monk spoke thus to that nun: “Go,
sister, in such and such a place alms-food is being given.” And she spoke thus:
“Go, master, in such and such a place alms-food is being given.”</p>
<p>These had become friends through constantly seeing (one another). Now at that
time robe-material was being distributed to the Order. Then that nun, going for
exhortation, approached that monk, and having approached and greeted that monk,
she stood at a respectful distance. As she was standing at a respectful
distance, that monk spoke thus to that nun:</p>
<p>“Sister, this is my share of the robe-material, you may accept it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, master, my robe is worn thin.” Then that monk gave that nun the
robe-material. Then that monk became one whose robe was worn thin. Monks spoke
thus to this monk.</p>
<p>“Your reverence, make up your robe-material now.” Then that monk told this
matter to the monks. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can a monk give robe-material to a nun?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monk, gave robe-material to a nun?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>“Is she a relation of yours, monk, or not a relation?”</p>
<p>“She is not a relation, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>“Foolish man, one who is not a relation does not know what is suitable or what
is unsuitable, or what <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.283" href="#BD.2.283"></a>
is right or what is wrong for a nun who is not a relation. How can you, foolish
man, give robe-material to a nun who is not a relation? It is not, foolish man,
for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of
training should be set forth:</p>
<p><span class="subrule">“Whatever monk should give robe-material to a nun who is not a relation, there
is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.25.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.25.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.25.2.1"></a>
Then scrupulous monks did not give robe-material in exchange to nuns. The nuns
… spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the masters not give robe-material to us in exchange?” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.60" href="#Vin.4.60"></a>
</p>
<p>Monks heard these nuns who … spread it about. Then these monks told this matter
to the lord. Then the lord on this occasion, in this connection, having given
reasoned talk addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks, I allow you to give in exchange to five (classes of people): to a monk,
a nun, a female probationer, a male novice, a female novice. I allow you,
monks, to give in exchange to these five (classes of people). And thus, monks,
this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should give robe-material to a nun who is not a relation, except
in exchange, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.25.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.25.3.1" href="#Bu-Pc.25.3.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… is monk to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Not a relation</span> means:
<span class="gloss">one who is not related on the mother’s side or the father’s side back through
seven generations.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.284" href="#BD.2.284"></a>
<span class="term">Nun</span> means:
<span class="gloss">one ordained by both Orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Robe-material</span> means:
<span class="gloss">any one robe-material of the six (kinds of) robe-materials, (including) the
least one fit for assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Except in exchange</span> means:
<span class="gloss">setting aside (the fact that) he gives in exchange, there is an offence of
expiation.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.25.3.2" href="#Bu-Pc.25.3.2"></a>
If he thinks that she is not a relation when she is not a relation, (and) gives
robe-material (to her), except in exchange, there is an offence of expiation.
If he is in doubt as to whether she is a relation … If he thinks that she is a
relation when she is not a relation … there is an offence of expiation. If he
gives robe-material to one ordained by one (Order only), except in exchange,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that she is not a relation
when she is a relation, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt
as to whether she is a relation, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he
thinks that she is a relation when she is a relation, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.25.3.3" href="#Bu-Pc.25.3.3"></a>
There is no offence if she is a relation; if there is an exchange; if there is
a large thing for a small thing, or a small thing for a large thing; if a nun
takes it on trust; if she takes it for the time being; if he gives another
requisite, except robe-material; if she is a female probationer, a female
novice; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
