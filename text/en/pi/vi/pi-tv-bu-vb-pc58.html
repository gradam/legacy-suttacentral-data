… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time many monks and wanderers were going along the high-road from Sāketa to Sāvatthī. On the way, thieves, having issued forth, robbed them. At Sāvatthī hirelings of the king, having issued forth, having seized these thieves with the goods, sent a messenger to the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Let the revered sirs come; let each, recognising his own robe, take it.”</p>
<p>The monks did not recognise them. They looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the revered sirs not recognise their own robes?”</p>
<p>Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of monks convened, having given reasoned talk on what is befitting, on what is suitable, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>
“On account of this, monks, I will lay down a rule of training for monks based on ten grounds: for the excellence of the Order, for the comfort of the Order … for establishing what is verily <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, for following discipline. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p><span class="rule">“When a monk obtains a new robe, any one mode of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.407" href="#BD.2.407"></a>
 disfigurement of the three modes of disfigurement must be taken: either dark green or mud(-colour) or black. If a monk should make use of a new robe without taking any one mode of disfigurement of the three modes of disfigurement, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">New</span> means:

<p><span class="term">Robe</span> means:
<span class="gloss">any one robe of the six (kinds of) robes.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Any one mode of disfigurement of the three modes of disfigurement must be taken</span> means:
<span class="gloss">even (as little as) with a blade of grass must be taken.</span></p>

<span class="gloss">there are two (kinds of) dark <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.408" href="#BD.2.408"></a>
 green: the dark green of bronze, the dark green of foliage.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Mud</span>(-colour) means:
<span class="gloss">it is called water.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Black</span> means:
<span class="gloss">anything that is of black.</span></p>

<span class="gloss"> <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.121" href="#Vin.4.121"></a>
 if a monk makes use of a new robe without having taken any one mode of disfigurement of the three modes of disfigurement, even (as little as) with a blade of grass, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

If he makes use of it, thinking that he has not taken when he has not taken, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether he has not taken … If he makes use of it, thinking that he has taken when he has not taken, there is an offence of expiation. If he thinks that he has not taken when he has taken, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether he has taken, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that he has taken when he has taken, there is no offence.</p>

There is no offence if, having taken, he makes use of it; if what is allowable becomes destroyed; if what made the appearance allowable becomes worn away; if what was not made allowable becomes sewn together with what was made allowable; if there is a patch; if there is a braiding; if there is a binding

 ; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
