… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
nuns ordained a probationer who had trained for two years in the six rules
(but) who was not agreed upon by the Order. Nuns spoke thus: “Come,
probationers, find out about this, give this, convey this, make this
allowable.” These spoke thus: “Ladies, we are not probationers, we are nuns.”
Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns
ordain a probationer who has trained for two years in the six rules (but) who
is not agreed upon by the Order?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns ordained … not agreed upon by the
Order?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns ordain … not agreed upon by the Order? It is not, monks,
for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … and having rebuked them, having
given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to give the agreement as to ordination to a probationer
who has trained for two years in the six rules. And thus, monks, should it be
given: That probationer who has trained for two years in the six rules, having
approached the Order … <span class="add"><a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bi-vb-pc63#Bi-Pc.63.1">Bi-Pc.63.1</a></span> … should speak thus:
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.321" href="#Vin.4.321"></a>
<span class="kamma">‘Ladies, I, so and so, a probationer who has trained for two years in the six
rules under the lady so and so, request the Order <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.368" href="#BD.3.368"></a>
for the agreement as to ordination.’ And a second time …
<span class="add">
<a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bi-vb-pc63#Bi-Pc.63.1">Bi-Pc.63.1</a>
<em>instead of</em> probationer
<em>read</em> probationer who has trained for two years in the six rules
<em>instead of</em> agreement as to training for two years in the six rules
<em>read</em> agreement as to ordination.</span> … So do I understand this.’</span>”</p>
<p>Then the lord, having rebuked the nuns in many a figure for their weakness in
maintaining themselves … “… this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should ordain a probationer who has trained for two years in the
six rules (but) who is not agreed upon by the Order, there is an offence of
expiation.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.64.2.1" href="#Bi-Pc.64.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Two years</span> means:
<span class="gloss">two years. </span></p>
<p><span class="term">Has trained</span> means:
<span class="gloss">has trained in the six rules. </span></p>
<p><span class="term">Not agreed upon</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the agreement as to ordination is not given by a (formal) act at which the
motion is followed by one proclamation.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should ordain</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… <span class="add"><a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bi-vb-pc61#Bi-Pc.61.2.1">Bi-Pc.61.2.1</a></span> …</span></p>
<p>There is no offence if she ordains a probationer who has trained for two years
in the six rules and who is agreed upon by the Order; if she is mad, if she is
the first wrong-doer.</p>
