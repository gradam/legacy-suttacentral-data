<h3>The story of Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.20"></a>
<a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.20.1"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.1.1" href="#Kd.20.1.1"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.352" href="#BD.5.352"></a>
At one time the Awakened One, the Lord, was staying among the Sakyans at
Kapilavatthu in the Banyan monastery. Then the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great,
approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, she stood at a
respectful distance. As she was standing at a respectful distance, the Gotamid,
Pajāpatī the Great, spoke thus to the Lord:</p>
<p>“Lord, it were well that women should obtain the going forth from home into
homelessness in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder.”</p>
<p>“Be careful, Gotami, of the going forth of women from home into homelessness in
this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder.” And a second time … And a
third time did the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great speak thus to the Lord: “Lord,
it were well …”</p>
<p>“Be careful, Gotami, of the going forth of women from home into homelessness in
this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder.”</p>
<p>Then the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, thinking: “The Lord does not allow women
to go forth from home into homelessness in the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder,” afflicted, grieved, with a
tearful face and crying, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping her right
side towards him.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.1.2" href="#Kd.20.1.2"></a>
Then the Lord having stayed at Kapilavatthu for as long as he found suiting,
set out on tour for Vesālī. Gradually, walking on tour, he arrived at Vesālī.
The Lord stayed there in Vesālī in the Great Grove in the Gabled Hall. Then the
Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, having had her hair cut off, having donned saffron
robes, set out for Vesālī with several Sakyan women, and in due course
approached Vesālī, the Great Grove, the Gabled Hall. Then the Gotamid, Pajāpatī
the Great, her feet swollen, her limbs covered with dust, with tearful face,
and crying, stood outside the porch of the gateway. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.353" href="#BD.5.353"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.254" href="#Vin.2.254"></a>
The venerable Ānanda saw the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, standing outside the
porch of the gateway, her feet swollen, her limbs covered with dust, with
tearful face and crying; seeing her, he spoke thus to the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the
Great:</p>
<p>“Why are you, Gotami, standing … and crying?”</p>
<p>“It is because, honoured Ānanda, the Lord does not allow the going forth of
women from home into homelessness in the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder.”</p>
<p>“Well now, Gotami, stay here a moment, until I have asked the Lord for the
going forth of women from home into homelessness in the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.1.3" href="#Kd.20.1.3"></a>
Then the venerable Ānanda approached the Lord; having approached, having
greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down
at a respectful distance, the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to the Lord:</p>
<p>“Lord, this Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, is standing outside the porch of the
gateway, her feet swollen, her limbs covered with dust, with tearful face and
crying, and saying that the Lord does not allow the going forth of women from
home into homelessness in the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder. It were well, Lord, if women
might obtain the going forth from home … by the Truth-finder.”</p>
<p>“Be careful, Ānanda, of the going forth of women from home … by the
Truth-finder.” And a second time … And a third time the venerable Ānanda spoke
thus to the Lord: “It were well, Lord, if women might obtain the going forth …
proclaimed by the Truth-finder.”</p>
<p>“Be careful, Ānanda, of the going forth of women from home into homelessness in
the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder.” Then the venerable Ānanda,
thinking: ‘The Lord does not allow the going forth of women from home into
homelessness in the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder. Suppose now that I, by some
other method, should ask the Lord for the going forth of women <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.354" href="#BD.5.354"></a>
from home into homelessness in the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder.” Then the venerable Ānanda
spoke thus to the Lord:</p>
<p>“Now, Lord, are women, having gone forth from home into homelessness in the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder, able to realise the fruit of
stream-attainment or the fruit of once-returning or the fruit of non-returning
or perfection?”</p>
<p>“Women, Ānanda, having gone forth … are able to realise … perfection.”</p>
<p>“If, Lord, women, having gone forth … are able to realise … perfection—and,
Lord, the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, was of great service: she was the Lord’s
aunt, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.255" href="#Vin.2.255"></a>
foster-mother, nurse, giver of milk, for when the Lord’s mother passed away she
suckled him—it were well, Lord, that women should obtain the going forth from
home into homelessness in the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder.”</p>
<h3>Eight important rules</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.1.4" href="#Kd.20.1.4"></a>
“If, Ānanda, the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, accepts eight important rules,
that may be ordination for her:</p>
<ol>
<li>“<span class="rule">A nun who has been ordained (even) for a century must greet respectfully, rise
up from her seat, salute with joined palms, do proper homage to a monk ordained
but that day. And this rule is to be honoured, respected, revered, venerated,
never to be transgressed during her life.</span></li>
<li>“<span class="rule">A nun must not spend the rains in a residence where there is no monk. This rule
too is to be honoured … during her life.</span></li>
<li>“<span class="rule">Every half month a nun should desire two things from the Order of monks: the
asking (as to the date) of the Observance day, and the coming for the
exhortation. This rule too is to be honoured … during her life.</span></li>
<li>“<span class="rule">After the rains a nun must ‘invite’ before both Orders in respect of three
matters: what was seen, what was heard, what was suspected. This rule too is to
be honoured … during her life.</span></li>
<li>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.355" href="#BD.5.355"></a>
<span class="rule">“A nun, offending against an important rule, must undergo <i lang="pi">mānatta</i> (discipline) for half a month before both Orders. This rule too must be
honoured … during her life.</span></li>
<li>“<span class="rule">When, as a probationer, she has trained in the six rules for two years, she
should seek ordination from both Orders. This rule too is to be honoured …
during her life.</span></li>
<li>“<span class="rule">A monk must not be abused or reviled in any way by a nun. This rule too is to
be honoured … during her life.</span></li>
<li>“<span class="rule">From today admonition of monks by nuns is forbidden, admonition of nuns by
monks is not forbidden. This rule too is to be honoured, respected, revered,
venerated, never to be transgressed during her life.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>“If, Ānanda, the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, accepts these eight important
rules, that may be ordination for her.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.1.5" href="#Kd.20.1.5"></a>
Then the venerable Ānanda, having learnt the eight important rules from the
Lord, approached the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great; having approached, he spoke
thus to the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great:</p>
<p>“If you, Gotami, will accept eight important rules, that will be the ordination
for you: a nun who has been ordained (even) for a century … From today
admonition of monks by nuns is forbidden … never to be transgressed during your
life. If you, Gotami, will accept these eight important rules, that will be the
ordination for you.”</p>
<p>“Even, honoured Ānanda, as a woman or a man when young, of tender years, and
fond of ornaments, having washed (himself and his) head, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.256" href="#Vin.2.256"></a>
having obtained a garland of lotus flowers or a garland of jasmine flowers or a
garland of some sweet-scented creeper, having taken it with both hands, should
place it on top of his head—even so do I, honoured Ānanda, accept these eight
important rules never to be transgressed during my life.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.1.6" href="#Kd.20.1.6"></a>
Then the venerable Ānanda approached the Lord: having approached, having
greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down
at a respectful distance, the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord,
the eight important rules were accepted by the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.356" href="#BD.5.356"></a>
“If, Ānanda, women had not obtained the going forth from home into homelessness
in the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder, the Brahma-faring, Ānanda,
would have lasted long, true <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> would have endured for a thousand years. But since, Ānanda, women have gone
forth … in the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder, now, Ānanda, the Brahma-faring
will not last long, true <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> will endure only for five hundred years.</p>
<p>“Even, Ānanda, as those households which have many women and few men easily
fall a prey to robbers, to pot-thieves, even so, Ānanda in whatever <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline women obtain the going forth from home into homelessness, that
Brahma-faring will not last long.</p>
<p>“Even, Ānanda, as when the disease known as mildew attacks a whole field of
rice that field of rice does not last long, even so, Ānanda, in whatever <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline women obtain the going forth … that Brahma-faring will not last
long.</p>
<p>“Even, Ānanda, as when the disease known as red rust attacks a whole field of
sugar-cane, that field of sugar-cane does not last long, even so, Ānanda, in
whatever <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline … that Brahma-faring will not last long.</p>
<p>“Even, Ānanda, as a man, looking forward, may build a dyke to a great reservoir
so that the water may not overflow, even so, Ānanda, were the eight important
rules for nuns laid down by me, looking forward, not to be transgressed during
their life.”</p>
<p class="end">Told are the Eight Important Rules for Nuns.</p>
<h3>Allowance for the ordination of nuns</h3>
<p>Then the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great approached the Lord; having approached,
having greeted the Lord, she stood at a respectful distance. As she was
standing at a respectful distance, the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great spoke thus
to the Lord:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.357" href="#BD.5.357"></a>
“Now, what line of conduct, Lord, should I follow in regard to these
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.257" href="#Vin.2.257"></a>
Sakyan women?” Then the Lord, gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted the
Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Then the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, gladdened … delighted by the Lord with
talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping her right side towards him. Then
the Lord on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks,
saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, nuns to be ordained by monks.</span>”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.20.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.2.2" href="#Kd.20.2.2"></a>
Then these nuns spoke thus to the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great: “The lady is
not-ordained, neither are we ordained, for it was thus laid down by the Lord:
nuns should be ordained by monks.”</p>
<p>Then the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great approached the venerable Ānanda; having
approached, having greeted the venerable Ānanda, she stood at a respectful
distance. As she was standing at a respectful distance, the Gotamid, Pajāpatī
the Great spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda: “Honoured Ānanda, these nuns
spoke to me thus: ‘The lady is not ordained, neither are we ordained, for it
was thus laid down by the Lord: nuns should be ordained by monks’.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Ānanda approached the Lord; having approached, having
greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down
at a respectful distance, the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord,
the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great spoke thus: ‘Honoured Ānanda, these nuns spoke
to me thus … nuns should be ordained by monks’.”</p>
<p>“At the time, Ānanda, when the eight important rules were accepted by the
Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, that was her ordination.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.20.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.3.1" href="#Kd.20.3.1"></a>
Then the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great approached the venerable Ānanda; having
approached, having greeted the venerable Ānanda, she stood at a respectful
distance. As she was standing at a respectful distance, the Gotamid, Pajāpatī
the Great spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda: “I, honoured Ānanda, am asking
one boon from the Lord: It were well, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.358" href="#BD.5.358"></a>
Lord, if the Lord would allow greeting, standing up for salutation and the
proper duties between monks and nuns according to seniority.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Ānanda approached the Lord; having approached, having
greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down
at a respectful distance, the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord,
the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great spoke thus: ‘I, honoured Ānanda, am asking one
boon … according to seniority’.”</p>
<p>“This is impossible, Ānanda, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.258" href="#Vin.2.258"></a>
it cannot come to pass, that the Truth-finder should allow greeting, standing
up for, salutation and the proper duties between monks and nuns according to
seniority. Ānanda, these followers of other sects, although liable to poor
guardianship, will not carry out greeting, standing up for, salutation and
proper duties towards women, so how should the Truth-finder allow greeting …
and proper duties towards women?” Then the Lord, on this occasion, having given
reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, one should not carry out greeting, rising up for salutation and proper
duties towards women. Whoever should carry out (one of these), there is an
offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.20.4"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.4.1" href="#Kd.20.4.1"></a>
Then the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great approached the Lord; having approached,
having greeted the Lord, she stood at a respectful distance. As she was
standing at a respectful distance, the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great spoke thus
to the Lord: “Lord, those rules of training for nuns which are in common with
those for monks, what line of conduct should we, Lord, follow in regard to
these rules of training?”</p>
<p>“Those rules of training for nuns, Gotami, which are in common with those for
monks, as the monks train themselves, so should you train yourselves in these
rules of training.”</p>
<p>“Those rules of training for nuns, Lord, which are not in common with those for
monks, what line of conduct should we, Lord, follow in regard to these rules of
training?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.359" href="#BD.5.359"></a>
“Those rules of training for nuns, Gotami, which are not in common with those
for monks, train yourselves in the rules of training according as they are laid
down.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.20.5"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.5.1" href="#Kd.20.5.1"></a>
Then the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great approached the Lord; having approached,
having greeted the Lord, she stood at a respectful distance. As she was
standing at a respectful distance, the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great spoke thus
to the Lord: “Lord, it were well if the Lord would teach me <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> in brief so that I, having heard the Lord’s <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, might live alone, aloof, zealous, ardent, self-resolute.”</p>
<p>“Whatever are the states, of which you, Gotami, may know: these states lead to
passion, not to passionlessness, they lead to bondage, not to the absence of
bondage, they lead to the piling up (of rebirth), not to the absence of piling
up, they lead to wanting much, not to wanting little, they lead to discontent,
not to contentment, they lead to sociability, not to solitude, they lead to
indolence, not to the putting forth of energy, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.259" href="#Vin.2.259"></a>
they lead to difficulty in supporting oneself, not to ease in supporting
oneself—you should know definitely, Gotami: this is not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, this is not discipline, this is not the Teacher’s instruction. But whatever
are the states of which you, Gotami, may know: these states lead to
passionlessness, not to passion … <span class="add"><em>the opposite of the preceding</em></span> … they lead to ease in supporting oneself, not to difficulty in supporting
oneself—you should know definitely, Gotami: this is <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, this is discipline, this is the Teacher’s instruction.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.20.6"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.6.1" href="#Kd.20.6.1"></a>
Now at that time the Pātimokkha was not recited to nuns. They told this matter
to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to recite the Pātimokkha to the nuns.</span>” Then it occurred to the nuns: “Now, by whom should the Pātimokkha be recited
to nuns?” They told this matter to the Lord. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.360" href="#BD.5.360"></a>
He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow monks, the Pātimokkha to be recited to nuns by monks.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time monks, having approached a nunnery, recited the Pātimokkha to
nuns. People looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “These are
their wives, these are their mistresses; now they will take their pleasure
together.” Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks
told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“
<span class="rule">Monks, the Pātimokkha should not be recited to nuns by monks. Whoever should
recite it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, the Pātimokkha to be recited to nuns by nuns.</span>”</p>
<p>The nuns did not know how to recite the Pātimokkha. They told this matter to
the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to explain to the nuns through monks, saying: ‘The
Pātimokkha should be recited thus’.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.6.2" href="#Kd.20.6.2"></a>
Now at that time nuns did not confess offences. They told this matter to the
Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, an offence should not be not confessed by a nun. Whoever should not
confess it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>” The nuns did not know how to confess offences. They told this matter to the
Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to explain to the nuns through monks, saying: ‘An offence
should be confessed thus’.</span>”
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.260" href="#Vin.2.260"></a></p>
<p>Then it occurred to monks: “Now, by whom should nuns’ offences be
acknowledged?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks to acknowledge nuns’ offences through monks.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time nuns, having (each) seen a monk on a carriage-road and in a
cul-de-sac and at cross-roads, having (each) laid down her bowl on the ground,
having arranged her upper robe over one shoulder, having sat down on her
haunches, having saluted with joined palms, confessed an offence. People …
spread it about, saying: “These are their wives, these are their mistresses;
having treated them <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.361" href="#BD.5.361"></a>
contemptuously during the night now they are asking for forgiveness.” They told
this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, nuns’ offences should not be acknowledged by monks. Whoever should
acknowledge (one), there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, nuns’ offences to be acknowledged by nuns.</span>” The nuns did not know how to acknowledge offences. They told this matter to
the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to explain to the nuns through monks, saying: ‘An offence
should be acknowledged thus’.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.6.3" href="#Kd.20.6.3"></a>
Now at that time (formal) acts were not carried out for nuns. They told this
matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a (formal) act to be carried out for nuns.</span>” Then it occurred to monks: ‘Now, by whom should (formal) acts for nuns be
carried out?’ They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, (formal) acts for nuns to be carried out by monks.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time nuns on whose behalf (formal) acts had been carried out,
having (each) seen a monk on a carriage-road and in a cul-de-sac and at
cross-roads, having (each) laid down her bowl on the ground, having arranged
her upper robe over one shoulder, having sat down on her haunches, having
saluted with joined palms, asked forgiveness thinking, “Surely it should be
done thus.” As before people … spread it about, saying: “These are their wives,
these are their mistresses; having treated them contemptuously during the night
now they are asking for forgiveness.” They told this matter to the Lord. He
said: “ <span class="rule">Monks, a (formal) act on behalf of nuns should not be carried out by monks.
Whoever should (so) carry one out, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, nuns to carry out (formal) acts on behalf of the nuns.</span>” Nuns did not know how (formal) acts should be carried out. They told this
matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to explain to the nuns through monks, saying: ‘A (formal)
act should be carried out thus’.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.20.7"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.7.1" href="#Kd.20.7.1"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.362" href="#BD.5.362"></a>
Now at that time nuns, in the midst of an Order,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.261" href="#Vin.2.261"></a>
striving, quarrelling, falling into disputes, wounding one another with the
weapons of the tongue, were not able to settle that legal question. They told
this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to settle nuns’ legal questions by monks.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time monks were settling a legal question for nuns, but as that
legal question was being investigated there were to be seen both nuns who were
entitled to take part in a (formal) act and those who had committed an offence.
The nuns spoke thus: “It were well, honoured sirs, if the ladies themselves
could carry out (formal) acts for nuns, if the ladies themselves could
acknowledge an offence of nuns, but it was thus laid down by the Lord: ‘Nuns’
legal questions should be settled by monks’.” They told this matter to the
Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, having cancelled the carrying out by monks of nuns’
(formal) acts, to give it into the charge of nuns to carry out nuns’ (formal)
acts by nuns; having cancelled (the acknowledgement) by monks of nuns’
offences, to give it into the charge of nuns to acknowledge nuns’ offences by
nuns.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.20.8"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.8.1" href="#Kd.20.8.1"></a>
Now at that time the nun who was the pupil of the nun Uppalavaṇṇā had followed
after the Lord for seven years mastering discipline, but because she was of
confused mindfulness, what she had learnt she forgot. That nun heard it said <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.363" href="#BD.5.363"></a>
that the Lord wished to come to Sāvatthī. Then it occurred to that nun: “For
seven years I have followed the Lord mastering discipline, but because I am of
confused mindfulness, what I have learnt is forgotten. Hard it is for a woman
to follow after a teacher for as long as her life lasts. What line of conduct
should be followed by me?” Then that nun told this matter to the nuns. The nuns
told this matter to the monks. The monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:
“<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, discipline to be taught to nuns by monks.</span>”</p>
<p class="end">The First Portion for Repeating.</p>

<a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.20.9"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.9.1" href="#Kd.20.9.1"></a>
Then the Lord, having stayed in Vesālī for as long as he found suiting, set out
on tour for Sāvatthī. Gradually, walking on tour, he arrived at Sāvatthī. The
Lord stayed there at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.262" href="#Vin.2.262"></a>
monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks sprinkled nuns with muddy

Now at that time monks asked nuns about the things which are stumbling-blocks.
Those wishing for ordination were at a loss, they were abashed, they were
unable to answer. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, ordination in the Order of monks after she has been ordained on
the one side, and has cleared herself (in regard to the stumbling-blocks) in
the Order of nuns.</span>”</p>
<p>Now at that time nuns asked those wishing for ordination,
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.376" href="#BD.5.376"></a>
but who were not instructed, about the things which are stumbling-blocks. Those
wishing for ordination <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.272" href="#Vin.2.272"></a>
were at a loss, they were abashed, they were unable to answer. They told this
matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow them, monks, having instructed first, afterwards to ask about the
things which are stumbling-blocks.</span>”</p>
<p>They instructed just there in the midst of the Order. As before, those wishing
for ordination were at a loss, they were abashed, they were unable to answer.
They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow them, monks, having instructed aside, to ask about the things which are
stumbling-blocks in the midst of the Order.</span> And thus, monks, should she be instructed: First, she should be invited to
choose a woman preceptor; having invited her to choose a woman preceptor, a
bowl and robes should be pointed out to her (with the words): ‘<span class="kamma">This is a bowl for you, this is an outer cloak, this is an upper robe, this is
an inner robe, this is a vest, this is a bathing-cloth; go and stand in such
and such a place</span>’.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.17.3" href="#Kd.20.17.3"></a>
Ignorant, inexperienced (nuns) instructed them. Those wishing for ordination,
but who were not instructed, were at a loss, they were abashed, they were
unable to answer. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“
<span class="rule">Monks, they should not be instructed by ignorant, inexperienced (nuns). Whoever
(such) should instruct them, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow them, monks, to instruct by means of an experienced, competent (nun).</span>”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.17.4" href="#Kd.20.17.4"></a>
Those who were not agreed upon instructed. They told this matter to the Lord.
He said:</p>
<p>“
<span class="rule">Monks, they should not be instructed by one who is not agreed upon. Whoever
(such) should instruct, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow them, monks, to instruct by means of one who is agreed upon.</span> And thus, monks, should she be agreed upon: oneself may be agreed upon by
oneself, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.377" href="#BD.5.377"></a>

by oneself? The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent nun,
saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Ladies, let the Order listen to me. So-and-so wishes for ordination through the

upon by another? The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent nun,
saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Ladies, let the Order listen to me. So-and-so wishes for ordination through the

<p>The shadow should be measured at once, the length of the season should be

heard it said that the men of abandoned life were besetting the way and she

<span class="add">as in <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-kd20#Kd.20.26.1">Kd.20.26.1</a></span> ‘<span class="kamma">… Thus do I understand this.</span>.”</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.20.26"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.26.1" href="#Kd.20.26.1"></a>
Now at that time a certain nun, having disavowed the training, left the Order;
having come back again she asked the nuns for ordination. They told this matter
to the Lord. He said: “Monks, there is no disavowal of the training by a nun,
but in so far as she is one who leaves the Order, she is in consequence not a
nun.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.26.2" href="#Kd.20.26.2"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.387" href="#BD.5.387"></a>
Now at that time a certain nun, wearing the saffron robes, went over to the
fold of a sect; having come back again she asked the nuns for ordination. They
told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Monks, whatever nun, wearing the
saffron robes, goes over to the fold of a sect, on coming back should not be
ordained.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.20.27"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.27.1" href="#Kd.20.27.1"></a>
Now at that time nuns
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.280" href="#Vin.2.280"></a>
being scrupulous, did not consent to greeting by men, to their cutting (their)
hair, to their cutting (their) nails, to their dressing a sore. They told this
matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow them, monks, to consent to (these actions).</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.27.2" href="#Kd.20.27.2"></a>
Now at that time nuns were sitting down cross-legged, consenting to the touch
of heels. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, nuns should not sit down cross-legged. Whoever should (so) sit down,
there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time a certain nun was ill. There was no comfort for her if she was
not cross-legged. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, the half cross-legged (posture) for nuns.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.27.3" href="#Kd.20.27.3"></a>
Now at that time nuns relieved themselves in a privy; the group of six nuns
caused abortion there. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, nuns should not relieve themselves in a privy. Whoever should do so
there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow them, monks, to relieve <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.388" href="#BD.5.388"></a>
themselves where it is open underneath, covered on top.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.20.27.4" href="#Kd.20.27.4"></a>
Now at that time nuns bathed with chunam. People looked down upon, criticised,
spread it about, saying: “Like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the
senses.” They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, nuns should not bathe with chunam. Whoever should (so) bathe, there is
an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow them, monks, the red powder of rice husks and clay.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time nuns bathed with scented clay. People … spread it about,
saying: “Like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses.” They told
this matter to the Lord. He said: “ <span class="rule">Monks, nuns should not bathe with scented clay. Whoever should (so) bathe,
there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow, them, monks, ordinary clay.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time nuns, bathing in a bathroom, created a disturbance. They told
this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, nuns should not bathe in a bathroom. Whoever should bathe (in one),
there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time nuns bathed against the stream consenting to the touch of the
current. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, nuns should not bathe against the stream. Whoever should (so) bathe,
there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time nuns bathed not at a ford; men of abandoned life seduced them.
They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, nuns should not bathe not at a ford. Whoever should (so) bathe, there is
an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time nuns bathed at a ford for men. People … spread it about,
saying, “Like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.281" href="#Vin.2.281"></a>
They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, nuns should not bathe at a ford for men. Whoever should (so) bathe,
there is an offence <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.389" href="#BD.5.389"></a>
of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow them monks, to bathe at a ford for women.</span>”</p>

<p class="end">Told is the Tenth Section: that on Nuns.</p>
<div class="uddana">
<h5>In this Section are a hundred and six items. This is its key:</h5>
<p>The Gotamid asked for the going forth, the Truthfinder did not allow it,
<br>
from Kapilavatthu the Leader went to Vesālī. /<br>
Covered with dust she made it known to Ānanda in the porch. <br>
Saying: “Is she able?” he asked about the method; saying, <br>
“(She was your) mother” and “(your) nurse.” / <br>
A century and that day, no monk, desiring, <br>
Invitation, important rules, two years, not abusing, / <br>
Complying with these eight rules for exhortation during her life.<br>
Acceptance of the important rules—that is the ordination for her. /<br>
A thousand years to only five (hundred) by the similes of the pot-thieves,<br>
mildew, red-rust: thus an injury to what is true <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. /<br>
May, looking forward, build a dyke; again it is the stability of what is true <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. <br>
To be ordained, the lady, greeting according to seniority, /<br>
Will not carry out like this, in common and not in common,<br>
about exhortation, and about the Pātimokkha, “now, by whom?”, to a nunnery, / <br>
If they do not know he explains, and they do not confess, through a monk,<br>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.390" href="#BD.5.390"></a>
to acknowledge through a monk, acknowledgement through a nun, /<br>
He explained, (formal) act, by a monk, they looked down on, or by a nun,<br>
to explain, and to quarrel, having cancelled, and about Uppala-(vaṇṇā), /<br>
In Sāvatthī, muddy water, did not greet, bodies and thighs<br>
and private parts and the group offended and associated with, /<br>
Not to be greeted is the penalty, for nuns likewise again,<br>
and the prohibition, exhortation, is it allowable? he went away, /<br>
Ignorant, without ground, decision, exhortation, an Order of five,<br>
two or three, they did not undertake, ignorant ones, ill, setting out on a
journey, /<br>
Forest-dwellers, they did not announce, and they did not come back,<br>

And plaited cloth, and fringed, and plaited thread, (and) fringed, /<br>
Cow’s leg-bone, cow’s jaw-bone, backs of the hands, likewise the feet,<br>
thighs (and) faces, gums, smearing, rubbing (and) with chunam, /<br>
They marked, and painting the body, painting the face, likewise the two,<br>
ointment marks (and) distinguishing marks, from a window, in the light, and
about dancing, / <br>

Courtesan, tavern, slaughter-house, a shop, usury, trade, <br>
they kept slaves, women slaves, servants, servant women, / <br>
Animals, and greens, they carried pieces of felt,<br>
robes that were dark green, yellow, red, crimson, that were black, /<br>
Brownish-yellow, reddish-yellow, not cut up, and long,<br>
and if they should wear (robes) with (borders) of flowers, snakes’ hoods,
jackets, <br>
as well as (garments made of the) Tirīṭa tree. /<br>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.391" href="#BD.5.391"></a>
If a nun, after she has gone, on a probationer, on a woman novice<br>
bestows her requisites, it is the (Order of) nuns that is the owner. /<br>
If a woman lay-follower on a monk, on a novice, on a lay-follower,<br>
and on others is bestowing her requisites, the (Order of) monks is the owner.
/<br>
About a Mallian (woman), foetus, base of the bowl, membrumand concerning food,<br>
and abundant, even greater, food that was stored, / <br>
As for monks below, do likewise for nuns,<br>
lodgings, menstruating, was soiled, and cloth and pin, / <br>
They broke, and all the time, there were to be seen: <br>
beginning with women without sexual characteristics, <br>
those defective in sex, bloodless, just the same for those with stagnant blood,
/ <br>
Always dressed, dripping, deformed, women eunuchs,<br>
man-like women, and those of indistinct sexuality, and those who were
hermaphrodites, /<br>
Beginning with those defective in sexual characteristics and going as far as
hermaphrodites.<br>
This is from the abbreviation below: leprosy, boils, eczema and / <br>
Consumption, epilepsy, are you a human woman? and a free woman?<br>
without debts (and) not in the royal service and allowed (and) twenty, /<br>
Complete, and what name and that of your woman proposer?:<br>
having asked about twenty-four stumbling-blocks, there is ordination. /<br>
They were at a loss, instructed, and likewise in the midst of the Order,<br>
a woman preceptor should be chosen, outer cloak, inner and upper robes, /<br>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.392" href="#BD.5.392"></a>
And vest (and) bathing cloth having explained them they may be used,<br>
ignorant ones, not agreed on, on one side, if she asks, questioned about the
stumbling-blocks, /<br>
Ordained on one side, likewise again in the Order of monks,<br>
the shadow, the season, the day and formula, the three resources, /<br>
The eight things not to be done, the right time, or everywhere eight,<br>
nuns did not invite, and the Order of monks likewise, /<br>
Disturbance, before the meal, and at the wrong time, disturbance,<br>
Observance, Invitation, commands, authority, /<br>
Leave, reproved, made to remember: objected to by the great Sage.<br>

<br>
In a forest, a store-room by a lay-follower, a dwelling,<br>
the building operations were not enough, pregnant, alone, /<br>
And sleeping under the same roof, against an important rule, <br>
and having disavowed, went over to the fold of, <br>
greeting and hair and nails and treating a sore, /<br>
Cross-legged, and ill, privy, with chunam, scented clay, <br>
in a bathroom, against the stream, not at a ford, and at one for men, /<br>
The Great Gotamid asked and also judiciously did Ānanda.<br>
There were four assemblies for going forth in the dispensation of the
Conqueror. / <br>
For the sake of arousing emotion for what is true <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and for awakening<br>
it was taught thus by the Awakened One, as medicine for a disease. /<br>
Other women also, recognised thus in what is true <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>,<br>
nurture the everlasting state where, having gone, they grieve not.
