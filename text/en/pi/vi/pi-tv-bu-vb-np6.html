<a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-NP.6.1"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.6.1.1" href="#Bu-NP.6.1.1"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.42" href="#BD.2.42"></a>
… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, came to be skilled in giving <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk. Now at that time a certain son of a (great) merchant approached the
venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, and having approached and greeted
the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, he sat down at a respectful
distance. As he was sitting at a respectful distance, the venerable Upananda,
the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.43" href="#BD.2.43"></a>
son of the Sakyans, gladdened … and delighted that son of a (great) merchant
with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk. And then the son of the (great) merchant, having been gladdened … and
delighted by the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk, said to the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans:</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, do let me know what will be of use. We are able to <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.211" href="#Vin.3.211"></a>
give to the master, that is to say of the requisites of robes, alms-food,
lodgings and medicine for the sick.”</p>
<p>“If you, sir, are desirous of giving something to me, give (me) one cloth from
these,” he said.</p>
<p>“Wait, honoured sir, until I go to the house; having gone to the house I will
send either one cloth from these or something better than these.”</p>
<p>A second time the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, said to the son
of the (great) merchant … A third time the venerable Upananda, the son of the
Sakyans, said to the son of the (great) merchant: “If you, sir, are desirous of
giving something to me, give (me) one cloth from these.”</p>
<p>“Now, honoured sir, for us who are sons of respectable families, it is awkward
to go out with (only) one piece of cloth. Wait, honoured sir, until I go to the
house; having gone to the house I will send either one cloth from these or
something better than these.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.44" href="#BD.2.44"></a>
“What is the good, sir, of your offering without desire to give, because even
after you have offered you do not give?”</p>
<p>Then that son of the (great) merchant, being pressed by the venerable Upananda,
the son of the Sakyans, giving one cloth, went away.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.6.1.2" href="#Bu-NP.6.1.2"></a>
People, seeing the son of a (great) merchant, spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Why do you, master, come with (only) one cloth?” Then this son of a (great)
merchant told this matter to these people. The people looked down upon,
criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“These recluses, sons of the Sakyans, have great desires, they are not
contented; among them it is not easy to make reasonable requests. How can they
take a cloth when a reasonable request was made by the son of a (great)
merchant?”</p>
<p>Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, ask the son of a
(great) merchant for a robe?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He
said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Upananda, asked the son of the (great)
merchant for a robe?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>“Is he a relation of yours, Upananda, or not a relation?”</p>
<p>“He is not a relation, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>“Foolish man, one who is not a relation does not know what is suitable or what
is unsuitable, or what is right or what is wrong for one who is not a relation.
Thus you, foolish man, will ask a son of a (great) merchant for a robe. It is
not, foolish man, for pleasing <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.45" href="#BD.2.45"></a>
those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should
be set forth:</p>
<p><span class="subrule">“Whatever monk should ask a man or a woman householder who is not a relation
(of his) for a robe, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-NP.6.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.6.2.1" href="#Bu-NP.6.2.1"></a>
Now at that time several monks
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.212" href="#Vin.3.212"></a>
were going along the high-road from Sāketa to Sāvatthī. Midway on the road,
thieves issuing forth, plundered these monks. Then these monks said:</p>
<p>“It is forbidden by the lord to ask a man or woman householder who is not a
relation for a robe.” And being scrupulous, they did not ask, (but) going naked
as they were to Sāvatthī, they saluted the monks respectfully. The monks said:</p>
<p>“Your reverences, these Naked Ascetics are very good because they respectfully
salute these monks.”</p>
<p>They said: “Your reverences, we are not Naked Ascetics, we are monks.”</p>
<p>The monks said to the venerable Upāli: “If so, reverend Upāli, question these.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Upāli, having questioned these monks, said to the monks:
“These are monks, your reverences; give them robes.”</p>
<p>Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can monks come
naked? Should they not come covered up with grass or leaves?” Then these monks
told this matter to the lord. Then the lord, on <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.46" href="#BD.2.46"></a>
that occasion, in that connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the
monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow, monks, one whose robe is stolen or one whose robe is destroyed, to
ask a man or woman householder who is not a relation (of his) for a robe. If
there is for the Order at the first residence which he approaches either a robe
in the dwelling-place or a bed-cover or a ground-covering or a mattress- <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.47" href="#BD.2.47"></a>
cover, (I allow) him to take it to put on, if he says, ‘Getting (a robe), I
will replace it.’ But if there is not for the Order either a robe in the
dwelling-place or a bed-cover or a ground-covering or a mattress-cover, then he
should come covered up with grass or leaves; but he should not come naked. Who
should so come, there is an offence of wrong-doing. And thus, monks, this rule
of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should ask a man or woman householder who is not a relation (of
his) for a robe, except at the right time, there is an offence of expiation
involving forfeiture. This is the right time in this case: if a monk becomes
one whose robe is stolen or whose robe is destroyed; in this case this is the
right time.”</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-NP.6.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.6.3.1" href="#Bu-NP.6.3.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he who …</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Monk</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… is monk to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Not a relation</span> means:
<span class="gloss">one who is not related on the mother’s side or on the father’s side back
through seven generations. </span></p>
<p><span class="term">A householder</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he who lives in a house.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">A woman householder</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she who lives in a house. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.213" href="#Vin.3.213"></a>
</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.48" href="#BD.2.48"></a>
<span class="term">A robe</span> means:
<span class="gloss">any one robe of the six (kinds of) robes (including) the least one fit for
assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Except at the right time</span> means:
<span class="gloss">setting the right time to one side.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">One whose robe is stolen</span> means:
<span class="gloss">a monk’s robe becomes stolen by kings or by thieves or by rogues, or it becomes
stolen by anyone whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">One whose robe is destroyed</span> means:
<span class="gloss">a monk’s robe becomes burnt by fire, or it becomes carried away by water, or it
becomes eaten by rats and white ants, or it becomes worn by use.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.6.3.2" href="#Bu-NP.6.3.2"></a>
If he asks, except at the right time, there is an offence of wrong-doing in the
action; it is to be forfeited on acquisition. It should be forfeited to the
Order, or to a group, or to an individual. And thus, monks, should it be
forfeited: ‘This robe, honoured sirs, asked for by me from a householder who is
not a relation, except at the right time, is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to
the Order.’ … ‘… the Order should give back … let the venerable ones give back
… I will give back this robe to the venerable one.’</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.6.3.3" href="#Bu-NP.6.3.3"></a>
If he thinks that a man (or woman) is not a relation when he is not a relation,
(and) asks for a robe except at the right time, there is an offence of
expiation involving forfeiture. If he is in doubt as to whether a man is not a
relation (and) asks for a robe except at the right time, there is an offence of
expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that a man is a relation when he
is not a relation, (and) asks for a robe except at the right time, there is an
offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that a man is not a
relation when he is a relation, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in
doubt as to whether a man is a relation, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.49" href="#BD.2.49"></a>
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that a man is a relation when
he is a relation, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.6.3.4" href="#Bu-NP.6.3.4"></a>
There is no offence if it is at the right time; if they belong to relations; if
they are invited; if it is for another; if it is by means of his own property;
if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
