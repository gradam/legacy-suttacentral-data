… in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.190" href="#Vin.4.190"></a>

<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.127" href="#BD.3.127"></a>
‘Attentively will I accept almsfood,’ is a training to be observed.”</p>
<p>One should accept almsfood attentively. Whoever out of disrespect accepts
almsfood inattentively, as though desirous of throwing it away, there is an
offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>There is no offence if it is unintentional … if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
