<a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.32.1"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.32.1.1" href="#Bu-Pc.32.1.1"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.306" href="#BD.2.306"></a>
… at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding-place. Now at that
time Devadatta, gain and honour lost, ate with his friends, having asked and
asked among households. People … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the recluses, sons of the Sakyans, eat, having asked and asked among
households? Who is not fond of well-cooked things? Who does not like sweet
things?”</p>
<p>Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can Devadatta eat with his friends, having asked and asked among
households?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Devadatta, ate with your friends, having
asked and asked among households?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, eat with your friends, having asked and asked among
households? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet)
pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.307" href="#BD.2.307"></a>
In a group-meal, there is an offence of expiation.”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.72" href="#Vin.4.72"></a>
</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.32.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.32.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.32.2.1"></a>
Now at that time people invited ill monks to a meal. The monks, being
scrupulous, did not consent, saying: “A group-meal is forbidden by the lord.”
They told this matter to the lord. Then the lord on this occasion, in this
connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, when a monk is ill to eat a group-meal. And thus, monks,
this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>In a group-meal, except at a right time, there is an offence of expiation. In
this case a right time is a time of illness; this is a right time in this
case.”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.32.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.32.3.1" href="#Bu-Pc.32.3.1"></a>
Now at that time people, at the time of giving robes, having prepared a meal
with the robes, invited monks, saying: “Having offered food, we will clothe
(you) with robes.” The monks, being scrupulous, did not consent, saying: “A
group-meal is forbidden by the lord.” <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.308" href="#BD.2.308"></a>
Little robe-material accrued (to them). They told this matter to the lord. He
said:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, at a time of giving robes, to eat a group-meal. And thus,
monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>In a group-meal, except at a right time, there is an offence of expiation. In
this case a right time is a time of illness, a time of giving robes; this is a
right time in this case.”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.32.4"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.32.4.1" href="#Bu-Pc.32.4.1"></a>
Now at that time people, at the (time of) making robes, invited monks to a
meal. The monks, being scrupulous, did not consent, saying: “A group-meal is
forbidden by the lord.” They told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, at a time of making robes, to eat a group-meal. And thus,
monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>In a group-meal, except at a right time, there is an offence of expiation. In
this case a right time is a time of illness, a time of giving robes, a time of
making robes; this is a right time in this case.”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.32.5"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.32.5.1" href="#Bu-Pc.32.5.1"></a>
Now at one time monks
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.73" href="#Vin.4.73"></a>
were going on a journey together with (some) men. Then these monks said to
these men:</p>
<p>“Sirs, wait a moment, we will go for alms-food.” These said:</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, eat just here.” The monks, being <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.309" href="#BD.2.309"></a>
scrupulous, did not accept (food), saying: “A group-meal is forbidden by the
lord.” They told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, at a time of going on a journey, to eat a group-meal. And
thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>In a group-meal, except at a right time, there is an offence of expiation. In
this case a right time is a time of illness, a time of giving robes, a time of
making robes, a time of going on a journey; this is a right time in this
case.”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.32.6"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.32.6.1" href="#Bu-Pc.32.6.1"></a>
Now at that time monks were going in a boat together with (some) men. Then
these monks said to these men:</p>
<p>“Sirs, take us to the bank for a moment, we will go for alms-food.” These said:</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, eat just here.” The monks, being scrupulous, did not accept
(food), saying: “A group-meal is forbidden by the lord.” …</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, at a time of being embarked in a boat, to eat a
group-meal. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>In a group-meal, except at a right time, there is an offence of expiation. In
this case a right time is a time of illness, a time of giving robes, a time of
making robes, a time of going on a journey, a time of being embarked in a boat;
this is a right time in this case.”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.32.7"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.32.7.1" href="#Bu-Pc.32.7.1"></a>
Now at that time, monks having spent the rains in (various) districts, came to
Rājagaha to see the lord. People, having seen the monks from various parts of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.310" href="#BD.2.310"></a>
the country, invited them to a meal. The monks, being scrupulous, did not
consent.</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to eat a group-meal when there is a great scarcity. And
thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>In a group-meal, except at a right time, there is an offence of expiation. In
this case a right time is a time of illness … a time of embarking in a boat,
when there is a great scarcity; this is a right time in this case.”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.74" href="#Vin.4.74"></a>
</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.32.8"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.32.8.1" href="#Bu-Pc.32.8.1"></a>
Now at one time a blood-relation of King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha had gone
forth among the Naked Ascetics. Then that Naked Ascetic approached King Seniya
Bimbisāra of Magadha, and having approached, he spoke thus to King Seniya
Bimbisāra of Magadha:</p>
<p>“I, sire, wish to make a meal for all heretics.”</p>
<p>“If, you, honoured sir, would first entertain the Order of monks with the
enlightened one at their head, you might do this.”</p>
<p>Then that Naked Ascetic sent a messenger to the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Let the monks consent to (take) a meal with me on the morrow.”</p>
<p>The monks, being scrupulous, did not consent, saying: “A group-meal is
forbidden by the lord.” Then that Naked Ascetic approached the lord, and having
approached he exchanged friendly greetings with the lord, and having exchanged
greetings of friendliness <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.311" href="#BD.2.311"></a>
and courtesy, he stood at a respectful distance. As he was standing at a
respectful distance, that Naked Ascetic spoke thus to the lord:</p>
<p>“The revered Gotama is gone forth; I, too, am gone forth. One who has gone
forth is worthy to accept the alms-food of one who has gone forth. Let the
revered Gotama consent to (take) a meal with me on the morrow together with the
Order of monks.”</p>
<p>The lord consented by becoming silent. Then that Naked Ascetic, having obtained
the lord’s consent, departed. Then the lord, on that occasion, in that
connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to eat a group-meal at a meal-time of recluses. And thus,
monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">In a group-meal, except at a right time, there is an offence of expiation. In
this case, a right time is a time of illness, a time of giving robes, a time of
making robes, a time of going on a journey, a time of being embarked in a boat,
when there is a great scarcity, a meal-time of recluses; this is a right time
in this case.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.32.9"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.32.9.1" href="#Bu-Pc.32.9.1"></a>
<span class="term">Group-meal</span> means:

<span class="gloss">setting a right time to one side.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Time of illness</span> means:
<span class="gloss">even when the feet become split; this means that at a time of illness (a

<p><span class="term">Time of giving robes</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the last month of the rainy season when the
<i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> cloth is not (formally)
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.312" href="#BD.2.312"></a>
made, the five months when the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> cloth is (formally) made; this means that at the time of giving robes (a
group-meal) may be eaten.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Time of making robes</span> means:
<span class="gloss">when the robes are being made; this means that at the time of making robes (a
group-meal) may be eaten. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.75" href="#Vin.4.75"></a>
</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Time of going on a journey</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he thinks: “I will go for half a <i lang="pi">yojana</i>,” (a group-meal) may be eaten, it may be eaten by him going out, it may be

<span class="gloss">when two or three monks, walking for alms-food, keep themselves going, (but)
when a fourth has come they do not keep themselves going; this means that when
there is a great scarcity (a group-meal) may be eaten.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Meal-time of recluses</span> means:
<span class="gloss">whoever makes a meal, being one who has attained (to the stage of) a wanderer,
this means that at the meal-time of recluses (a group-meal) may be eaten.</span></p>
<p>If, except at the right time, he accepts (food), thinking, “I will eat,” there
is an offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful there is an offence of
expiation.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.32.9.2" href="#Bu-Pc.32.9.2"></a>
If he thinks that it is a group-meal when it is a group-meal, (and) eats,
except at a right time, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as
to whether it is a group-meal … If he thinks that it is not a group-meal when
it is a group-meal … offence of expiation. If he thinks that it is a group-meal
when it is not a group-meal, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in
doubt as to whether it is not a group-meal, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.313" href="#BD.2.313"></a>
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not a group-meal
when it is not a group-meal, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.32.9.3" href="#Bu-Pc.32.9.3"></a>
There is no offence if it is at a right time; if two or three eat together; if
having walked one by one for alms, they eat having assembled together; if it is
the regular supply of food; if it is food (allowed by) ticket; if it is (food
given) on a day of the waxing or waning of the moon, if it is (given) on an
Observance day, if <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.314" href="#BD.2.314"></a>
it is (given) on the day after an Observance day; setting aside the five (kinds
of) meals, there is no offence in (eating) any other; if he is mad, if he is
the first wrong-doer.</p>
