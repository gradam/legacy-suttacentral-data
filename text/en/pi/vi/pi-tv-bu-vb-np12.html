… at Vesālī in the Great Grove in the Hall of the Peaked Roof. At that time the
group of six monks had a rug made of pure black sheep’s wool. People, engaged
in touring the dwelling-place, seeing them … spread it about, saying: “How can
these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, have a rug made of pure black sheep’s
wool, like householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses?” Monks heard these
people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks … spread it about,
saying:</p>
<p>“How can the group of six monks have a rug made of pure black sheep’s wool?”
Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, had a rug made of pure black sheep’s
wool?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How can you, foolish men,
have a rug made of pure black sheep’s wool? It is not, foolish men, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of
training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should cause a rug to be made of pure black sheep’s wool, there
is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.” </span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… is monk to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Black</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there are two (kinds of) black: black by nature or dyed black.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">A rug</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is made “having spread,” not woven. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.226" href="#Vin.3.226"></a>
</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should cause to be made</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he makes it or causes it to be made, there is an offence of wrong-doing in
the action. It is to be forfeited … to an individual. And thus, monks, should
it be forfeited: … ‘… this rug which I, honoured sirs, had made of pure black
sheep’s wool …’ … if he is the first wrong-doer.</span></p>
