… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a chief minister, the supporter of the venerable Upananda, the son of the
Sakyans, sent a robe-fund by a messenger to the venerable Upananda, the son of
the Sakyans, saying: “Having got a robe in exchange for this robe-fund, present
master Upananda with a robe.”</p>
<p>Then that messenger approached the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans,
and having approached, he said to the venerable Upananda, the son of the
Sakyans: “Honoured sir, this robe-fund was brought for the venerable one; let
the venerable one accept this robe-fund.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.220" href="#Vin.3.220"></a>
</p>
<p>When he had spoken thus, the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, said
to that messenger: “Sir, we do not accept a robe-fund; but we accept a robe if
it is at the right time and if it is allowable.”</p>
<p>When he had spoken thus, that messenger said to the venerable Upananda, the son
of the Sakyans: “But is there someone who is the venerable one’s attendant?”</p>
<p>At that time a certain lay-follower went to the monastery on some business or
other. Then the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, said to that
messenger: “Sir, this lay-follower is the monks’ attendant.”</p>
<p>Then that messenger, informing that lay-follower, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.63" href="#BD.2.63"></a>
approached the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, and having
approached, he said to the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans:</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, the person whom the venerable one has pointed out as an
attendant has been instructed by me; let the venerable one approach (him) at
the right time (and) he will present you with a robe.”</p>
<p>Then the chief minister sent a messenger to the venerable Upananda, the son of
the Sakyans, to say: “Let the master make use of this robe; we want this robe
made use of by the master.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, did not say anything to
that lay-follower. A second time the chief minister sent a messenger to the
venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, to say: “Let the master make use of
… by the master. “A second time the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans,
did not say anything to that lay-follower. A third time the chief minister sent
a messenger to the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, to say: “Let the
master make use of … by the master.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.10.1.2" href="#Bu-NP.10.1.2"></a>
Now at that time there came to be a meeting-day for the townspeople, and an
agreement was made by the townspeople that: Whoever comes the last pays fifty.
Then the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, approached that
lay-follower, and having approached, he said to that lay-follower:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.64" href="#BD.2.64"></a>
“Sir, I want the robe.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, wait this day (only). Today there comes to be a meeting-day for
the townspeople, and an agreement was made by the townspeople that: Whoever
comes last pays fifty.”</p>
<p>“Sir, give me the robe this very day,” he said, and he took hold of his
waist-band. Then that lay-follower, being pressed by the venerable Upananda,
the son of the Sakyans, having got a robe in exchange for the venerable
Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, went the last. People said to this
lay-follower: “Why do you, master, come the last? You have lost fifty.” Then
that lay-follower told this matter to those people. The people … spread it
about, saying:</p>
<p>“These recluses, sons of the Sakyans, have great desires, they are not
contented; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.221" href="#Vin.3.221"></a>
amongst them it is not easy to render a service. How can they, being told by a
lay-follower: ‘Honoured sir, wait this day (only),’ not wait?” Monks heard
these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks … spread it
about, saying: “How can the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, being
told by a lay-follower: ‘Honoured sir, wait this day (only),’ not wait?” Then
these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Upananda, being <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.65" href="#BD.2.65"></a>
told by a lay-follower: ‘Honoured sir, wait this day (only),’ did not wait?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, being told by a lay-follower: ‘Honoured sir, wait
this day (only),’ not wait? Foolish man, it is not for pleasing those who are
not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set
forth:</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.10.1.3" href="#Bu-NP.10.1.3"></a>
“<span class="rule">In case a king or one in the service of a king or a brahmin or a householder
should send a robe-fund for a monk by a messenger, saying: ‘Having got a robe
in exchange for this robe-fund, present the monk so and so with a robe’; then
if this messenger, approaching that monk, should say: ‘Honoured sir, this
robe-fund was brought for the venerable one; let the venerable one accept this
robe-fund,’ then the messenger should be spoken to thus by this monk: ‘Sir, we
do not accept a robe-fund, but we accept a robe if it is at the right time and
if it is allowable.’ If this messenger should say to the monk: ‘But is there
someone who is the venerable one’s attendant?’, then, monks, an attendant
should be pointed out by the monk in need of a robe—either one who is engaged
in the monastery or a lay-follower—saying: ‘This is the monks’ attendant.’ If
this messenger, instructing this attendant, approaching that monk, should speak
thus: ‘Honoured <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.66" href="#BD.2.66"></a>
sir, I have instructed the person whom the venerable one pointed out as an
attendant; let the venerable one approach at the right time, (and) he will
present you with a robe’; then, monks, if that monk is in need of a robe,
approaching that attendant, he should state and remind him two or three times,
saying: ‘Sir, I am in need of a robe.’ If while stating and reminding two or
three times, he succeeds in obtaining that robe, that is good. If he does not
succeed in obtaining it, he should stand silently for it four times, five
times, six times at the utmost. If he succeeds in obtaining that robe, standing
silently for it, four times, five times, six times at the utmost, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.222" href="#Vin.3.222"></a>
that is good. If he, exerting himself further than that, succeeds in obtaining
that robe, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he does
not succeed in obtaining it, he should either go himself to where the robe-fund
was brought from for him, or a messenger should be sent to say: ‘That robe-fund
which you, sirs, sent for a monk, is not of any use to that monk. Let the
gentlemen make use of their own, let your own things be not lost.’ This is the
proper course in this case.</span>”</p>

<p><span class="term">Present</span> means:

<p>If that messenger, approaching that monk, should say : ‘Honoured sir, this
robe-fund was brought for the venerable one, let the venerable one accept this
robe-fund,’ then this messenger should be spoken to thus by this monk: … ‘… is
the monks’ attendant.’ He should not say: ‘Give it to him,’ or ‘He will deposit
it,’ or ‘He will barter it,’ or ‘He will get it in exchange.’</p>
<p>If this messenger, instructing this attendant, approaching that monk, should
speak thus: ‘Honoured sir, I have instructed the person whom the venerable one
pointed out as an attendant; let the venerable one approach at the right time
(and) he will present you with a robe’; then, monks, if that monk is in need of
a robe, approaching that attendant, he should state and remind him two or three
times, saying: ‘Sir, I am in need of a robe.’ He should not say: ‘Give me a
robe,’ ‘Fetch me a robe,’ ‘Barter a robe for me,’ ‘Get a robe in exchange for
me.’ A second time he should say … A third time he should say …</p>
<p>If … he succeeds in obtaining (that robe), that is good. If he does not succeed
in obtaining it, going there, he should stand silently for it; he should not
sit down on a seat, he should not accept food, he should not <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.68" href="#BD.2.68"></a>
teach dhamma; being asked, ‘Why did you come?’ he should say: ‘You know it,
sir.’ If he either sits down on a seat <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.223" href="#Vin.3.223"></a>
or accepts food or teaches <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, he loses an opportunity. A second time he may stand. A third time he may
stand. Having stated four times, he may stand four times. Having stated five
times, he may stand twice. Having stated six times, he may not stand.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.10.2.2" href="#Bu-NP.10.2.2"></a>
If he, exerting himself further than that, succeeds in obtaining that robe,
there is an offence of wrong-doing in the action. It is to be forfeited on
acquisition; it should be forfeited to the Order, or to a group, or to an <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.69" href="#BD.2.69"></a>
individual. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: ‘Honoured sirs, this robe
obtained by me, by stating more than three times, by standing more than six
times, is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to the Order.’ … ‘… the Order should
give back … let the venerable ones give back … I will give back this robe to
the monk so and so.’</p>
<p>If he does not succeed in obtaining it, he should either go himself to where
the robe-fund was brought from for him, or a messenger should be sent to say:
‘That robe-fund which you, sirs, sent for a monk, is not of any use to that
monk. Let the gentlemen make use of their own, let your own things be not
lost.’</p>
<p><span class="term">This is the proper course in this case</span> means:

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.10.2.3" href="#Bu-NP.10.2.3"></a>
If he succeeds in obtaining it by stating more than three times, by standing
more than six times, thinking that they are more, there is an offence of
expiation involving forfeiture. If he succeeds in obtaining it by stating more
than three times, by standing more than six times, but is in doubt (as to the
number of times), there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he
succeeds in obtaining it by stating more than three times, by standing more
than six times, thinking them to be less, there is an offence of expiation
involving forfeiture. If, stating less than three times, standing less than six
times, he thinks them to be more, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If
stating less than three times, standing less than six times, he is in doubt (as
to the number), there is an offence of wrong-doing. If, stating less than three
times, standing less than six times, he thinks them to be less, there is no
offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.10.2.4" href="#Bu-NP.10.2.4"></a>
There is no offence in stating three times, in standing six times; in stating
less than three times, in standing <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.70" href="#BD.2.70"></a>
less than six times; if himself not stating, he gives; if stating, the owners
give; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
