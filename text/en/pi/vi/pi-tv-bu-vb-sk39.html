… in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks made up
large mouthfuls … “…</p>
<p>‘I will not make up too large a mouthful,’ is a training to be observed.”</p>
<p>One should not make up too large a mouthful. Whoever out of disrespect makes up
too large a mouthful, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>There is no offence if it is unintentional, if he is not thinking, if he does
not know, if he is ill, if they are solid victuals, all sorts of fruits,
dainties, if there are accidents, if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
