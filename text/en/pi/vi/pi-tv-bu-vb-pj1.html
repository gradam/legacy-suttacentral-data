<p class="namo">Homage to the Master, the <i lang="pi">Arahant</i>, the fully Awakened One</p>
<h2>The origin of the Vinaya: on Verañjā</h2>
<a class="ms-pa" id="ms.1"></a>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.1"></a> <a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.1.1"></a> <a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.1.1"></a> <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.1"></a> <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.1"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.2"></a> At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Verañjā near Naḷeru’s Nimba tree with a great Sangha of five hundred monks. And a brahmin in Verañjā was told:</p>
<div class="sutta-parallel">
<p>“Sir, the ascetic Gotama, the Sakyan, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, is staying at Verañjā near Naleru’s Nimba tree with a great Sangha of five hundred monks. That Master Gotama has acquired a good reputaton:</p>
<p>‘He is indeed a Master, an <i lang="pi">arahant</i>, fully awakened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the worlds, unsurpassed trainer of tamable people, teacher of gods and humans, the Awakened <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.2"></a> One, the Master. With his own direct knowledge he has realized this world with its gods, its lords of death, and its supreme beings, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans, and he makes it known to others. He teaches a <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals a perfectly complete and pure spiritual life.’ It’s good to see such <i lang="pi">arahants</i>.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.1.2"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.3"></a> Then that brahmin went to the Master, exchanged friendly greetings with him, and sat down <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.2"></a> to one side. And he said this:</p>
<p>“I have heard, good Gotama, that the ascetic Gotama doesn’t pay homage to old brahmins or stand up for them or offer them a seat. This is indeed so, for the good Gotama doesn’t pay homage to old brahmins or stand up for them or offer them a seat. This is not proper.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.4"></a> “Brahmin, in the world with its gods, its lords of death, and its supreme beings, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans, I don’t see anyone to whom I should pay homage, for whom I should rise up or to whom I should offer a seat. If the Tathāgata <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.3"></a> paid homage to anyone, rose up for him, or offered him a seat, his head might split apart.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.1.3"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.5"></a> “Good Gotama lacks taste.”</p>
<p>“There is indeed a way in which one could truly say of me, ‘The ascetic Gotama lacks taste.’ For the taste for forms, sounds, scents, flavours, and tangible objects has been destroyed by the Tathāgata, cut off at the root, made like a palm-stump, so utterly done away with that it is incapable of reappearing. This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ‘The ascetic Gotama lacks taste.’ But that is not what you meant.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.6"></a> “Good Gotama is without enjoyment.”</p>
<p>“There is indeed a way in which one could truly say of me, ‘The ascetic Gotama is without enjoyment.’ For the enjoyment of forms, sounds, scents, flavours, and tangible objects has been destroyed by the Tathāgata, cut off at the root, made like a palm-stump, so utterly done away with that it is incapable of reappearing. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.4"></a> This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ‘The ascetic Gotama is without enjoyment.’ But that is not what you meant.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.7"></a> “Good Gotama professes the doctrine of non-action.”</p>
<p>“There is indeed a way in which one could truly say of me, ‘The ascetic Gotama professes the doctrine of non-action.’ For I teach the non-doing of misconduct by body, speech, and mind. I teach the non-doing of all sorts of bad, unwholesome actions. This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ‘The ascetic Gotama professes the doctrine of non-action.’ But that is not what you meant.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.8"></a> “Good Gotama professes the doctrine of annihilation.”</p>
<p>“There is indeed a way in which one could truly say of me, ‘The ascetic Gotama professes the doctrine of annihilation.’ For I speak of the annihilation of sense desire, anger, and confusion; I speak of the annihilation of all sorts of bad, unwholesome qualities. This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ‘The ascetic Gotama professes the doctrine of annihilation.’ <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.3"></a> But that is not what you meant.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.9"></a> “Good Gotama is one who detests.”</p>
<p>“There is indeed a way in which one could truly say of me, ‘The ascetic Gotama is one who detests.’ For I detest misconduct by <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.5"></a> body, speech, and mind, and the acquisition of all sorts of bad, unwholesome qualities. This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ‘The ascetic Gotama is one who detests.’ But that is not what you meant.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.10"></a> “Good Gotama is a disciplinarian.”</p>
<p>“There is indeed a way in which one could truly say of me, ‘The ascetic Gotama is a disciplinarian.’ For I teach the Dhamma for the disciplining of sense desire, anger, and confusion; I teach the Dhamma for the disciplining of of all sorts bad, unwholesome qualities. This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ‘The ascetic Gotama is a disciplinarian.’ But that is not what you meant.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.11"></a> “Good Gotama is one who practises austerities.”</p>
<p>“There is indeed a way in which one could truly say of me, ‘The ascetic Gotama is one who practises austerities.’ For I say that bad, unwholesome qualities—misconduct by body, speech, and mind—are to be burned up. He who has destroyed the bad, unwholesome qualities that are to be burned up, who has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm-stump, done away with them so utterly that they are incapable of reappearing—him I call one who practises austerities. The Tathāgata has destroyed the bad, unwholesome qualities that are to be burned up, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.6"></a> has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm tree, done away with them so utterly that they are incapable of reappearing. This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ‘The ascetic Gotama is one who practises austerities.’ But that is not what you meant.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.12"></a> “Good Gotama is withdrawn.”</p>
<p>“There is indeed a way in which one could truly say of me, ‘The ascetic Gotama is withdrawn.’ He whose future conception in a womb, whose rebirth in a future life, is destroyed and cut off at the root, made like a palm-stump, so utterly done away with that he is incapable of reappearing—him I call one who is withdrawn. The Tathāgata’s future conception in a womb, his rebirth in a future life, is destroyed and cut off at the root, made like a palm-stump, so utterly done away with that he is incapable of reappearing. This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ‘The ascetic Gotama is withdrawn.’ But that is not what you meant.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.1.4"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.13"></a> “Brahmin, suppose there was a hen with eight or ten or twelve eggs, which she had properly covered, properly warmed, and properly incubated. Is the first chick that hatches safely—after piercing through the egg-shell with the point of the claw on its foot, or with its beak—to be called the eldest or the youngest?”</p>
<p>“He is to be called the eldest, good Gotama, for he is the eldest of those.”</p>
<p>“Even so in this generation without understanding, being like an egg, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.4"></a> covered over, I <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.7"></a> alone in the world have split the eggshell of ignorance and reached the unsurpassed full awakening. I, brahmin, am the world’s eldest and best.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.1.5"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.14"></a> “I was firmly energetic and had clarity of mindfulness; my body was tranquil and my mind unified. Fully secluded from the five senses, secluded from unwholesome mental qualities, I entered and remained in the first <i lang="pi">jhāna</i>, which consists of rapture and happiness born of seclusion, accompanied by movement of the mind. Through the stilling of the movement of the mind, I entered and remained in the second <i lang="pi">jhāna</i>, which has internal confidence and unification of mind and consists of rapture and happiness born of <i lang="pi">samādhi</i>. Through the fading away of rapture, I remained even-minded, mindful, and clearly comprehending, experiencing happiness directly, and I entered and remained in the third <i lang="pi">jhāna</i> of which the noble ones declare, ‘One is even-minded, mindful, and abides in happiness.’ Through the abandoning of happiness and suffering and the earlier ending of joy and displeasure, I entered and remained in the fourth <i lang="pi">jhāna</i>, which has neither suffering nor happiness and consists of purity of mindfulness and even-mindedness.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.1.6"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.15"></a> “Then, with my mind collected, clarified, purified, flawless, void of taints, grown soft and pliable, steady, and <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.8"></a> imperturbable, I directed it to the knowledge of the memory of former lives. I recollected many past lives, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, and many eons of world dissolution, many eons of world evolution, and many eons of both dissolution and evolution, and I knew: ‘There I had such a name, such a family, such appearance, such food, such experience of happiness and suffering, and such a life-span. Passing away from there I was reborn elsewhere, and there I had such a name, such a family, such appearance, such food, such experience of happiness and suffering, and such a life-span. Passing away from there I was reborn here.’ In this way I recollected many past lives with their characteristics and particulars. This was the first knowledge attained by me in the first watch of the night. Ignorance was dispelled and understanding arose, darkness was dispelled and light arose, as happens to one who remains heedful, ardent, and energetic. This, brahmin, was my first <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.9"></a> breaking out, like a chick from an eggshell.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.1.7"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.16"></a> “Then, with my mind collected, clarified, purified, flawless, void of taints, grown soft and pliable, steady, and imperturbable, I directed it to the knowledge of the arising and passing away of beings. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.5"></a> With the purified divine eye surpassing that of humans, I saw beings passing away and getting reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, gone to good destinations and bad destinations, and I understood how beings fare according to their actions: ‘These beings who engaged in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, who abused the noble ones, held wrong view and acted accordingly, at the breaking up of the body after death, have arisen in the plane of misery, a bad destination, the abyss, hell. But these beings who engaged in good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not abuse the noble ones, held right view and acted accordingly, at the breaking up of the body after death, have arisen in a good destination, a heaven world.’ In this way, with the purified divine eye surpassing that of humans, I saw beings passing away and getting reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, gone to good destinations and bad destinations, and I understood how beings fare according to their actions. This was the second knowledge attained by me in the middle watch of the night. Ignorance was dispelled and understanding arose, darkness was dispelled and light arose, as happens to one who remains heedful, ardent, and energetic. This, brahmin, was my second breaking out, like a chick from an eggshell.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.1.8"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.17"></a> “Then, with my mind collected, clarified, purified, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.10"></a> flawless, void of taints, grown soft and pliable, steady, and imperturbable, I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the corruptions. I knew according to reality: ‘This is suffering;’ ‘This is the origin of suffering;’ ‘This is the end of suffering;’ ‘This is the path leading to the end of suffering.’ I knew according to reality: ‘These are the corruptions;’ ‘This is the origin of the corruptions;’ ‘This is the end of the corruptions;’ ‘This is the path leading to the end of the corruptions.’ When I knew and saw this, my mind was freed from the corruption of sense desire, from the corruption of existence, from the corruption of views, and from the corruption of ignorance. When it was freed, I knew it was freed, and I understood that birth was ended, the spiritual life had been lived, the job had been done, there was no further state of existence. This was the third knowledge attained by me in the third watch of the night. Ignorance was dispelled and understanding arose, darkness was dispelled and light arose, as happens to one who remains heedful, ardent, and energetic. This, brahmin, was <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.6"></a> my third breaking out, like a chick from an eggshell.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.1.9"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.18"></a> The brahmin said to the Master:</p>
<p>“Good Gotama is the eldest; good Gotama is the best! Wonderful, good Gotama, wonderful! Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what had been hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see what is there—even so has the good <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.11"></a> Gotama made the Dhamma clear in many ways. To good Gotama I go for refuge, and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monks. May the good Gotama accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life. And may the good Gotama consent to spend the rains at Verañjā together with the Sangha of monks.” The Master consented by keeping silent, and the brahmin understood. He then rose from his seat, paid homage to the Master, circumambulated him with his right side towards him, and departed.</p>

<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.1.2"></a> <a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.2.1"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.19"></a> At that time Verañjā was short of food and stricken by hunger, with crops blighted and turned to straw. It was not easy to keep oneself going by collecting alms. Just then some horse-dealers from Uttarāpathaka entered <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.12"></a> the rains residence at Verañjā with five hundred horses. In the horse-pen they prepared <i lang="pi">pattha</i> measure after <i lang="pi">pattha</i> measure of steamed grain for the monks. The monks, after dressing in the morning, took their bowls and robes and entered Verañjā for alms. Being unable to obtain anything, they went to the horse-pen. They then brought the <i lang="pi">pattha</i> measures of steamed grain back to the monastery, pounded them, and ate them. Venerable Ānanda crushed a <i lang="pi">pattha</i> measure of the steamed grain on a stone, took it to the Master, and the Master ate it.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.20"></a> The Master heard the sound of the mortar. Tathāgatas sometimes ask knowing, and knowing sometimes do not ask; they ask knowing the right time to ask, and they ask knowing the right time when not to ask. Tathāgatas <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.13"></a> ask when it is beneficial, not when it is unbeneficial; in regard to what is unbeneficial, the Tathāgatas have destroyed the bridge. The Buddhas, the Masters, question the monks for two reasons: “We shall teach the Dhamma or lay down a training rule for the disciples.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.21"></a> And so the Master addressed Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, what is this sound of a mortar?”</p>
<p>Venerable Ānanda informed the Master. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.7"></a></p>
<p>“Good, good, Ānanda, you who are superior people have conquered (the problems of famine); later generations will despise even rice and meat.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.2.2"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.22"></a> Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna approached the Master, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. He then said:</p>
<p>“At present, Master, Verañjā is short of food <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.14"></a> and stricken by hunger, with crops blighted and turned to straw. It’s not easy to keep oneself going by collecting alms. Master, the under-surface of this great earth is abounding with food, and its taste is just like pure honey. It would be good, Master, if I inverted the earth, so that the monks might enjoy the nutrition in the water-plants.”</p>
<p>“But what will you do, Moggallāna, with those creatures who are supported by the earth?”</p>
<p>“I will make one of my hands broad, like the great earth, and I will make those creatures who are supported by the earth go there. Then with the other hand I will invert the earth.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t invert the earth, Moggallāna. The creatures might get deranged.”</p>
<p>“In that case, Master, it would be good if the whole Sangha of monks could go to Uttarakuru for alms.”</p>
<p>“Do not pursue this idea, Moggallāna.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.1.3"></a> <a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.3.1"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.23"></a> Then, while Venerable Sāriputta was in seclusion, he thought this: “For which Buddhas, for which Masters, did the spiritual life not last long? For which Buddhas, for which Masters, did the spiritual life last long?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.24"></a> When Venerable Sāriputta came out of seclusion in the evening, he approached the Master. He paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said this: <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.15"></a> “Just now, Master, when I was in seclusion, I thought this: ‘For which Buddhas, for which Masters, did the spiritual life not last long, and for which ones did it last long?’”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.25"></a> “Sāriputta, the spiritual life established by Master Vipassī, Master Sikhī, and Master Vessabhū did not last long. But the spiritual life established by Master Kakusandha, Master Konāgamana, and Master Kassapa <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.8"></a> did last long.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.3.2"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.26"></a> “And what is the reason why the spiritual life established by Master Vipassī, Master Sikhī, and Master Vessabhū did not last long?”</p>
<p>“Master Vipassī, Master Sikhī, and Master Vessabhū were disinclined to teach the Dhamma in detail to their disciples. They had few discourses in prose, and in prose and verse; few expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and analyses; and training rules were not laid down and a <i lang="pi">pātimokkha</i> was not recited. After the disappearance of those Buddhas, those Masters, after the disappearance of the disciples enlightened under them, those who were the last disciples—of various <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.16"></a> names, clans, and social standing, who had gone forth from various families—caused that spiritual life rapidly to disappear. It’s just like loose flowers on a flat surface that are scattered about, whirled about, and destroyed by the wind. Why is that? Because they are not held together by a thread. Even so, after the disappearance of those Buddhas, those Masters, after the disappearance of the disciples enlightened under them, those who were the last disciples caused that spiritual life rapidly to disappear.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.27"></a> “But, Sāriputta, those Masters were untiring in exhorting their disciples after reading their minds. Formerly, while staying in a certain frightening jungle thicket, Master Vessabhū, the <i lang="pi">arahant</i>, the fully Awakened One, exhorted and admonished a Sangha of a thousand monks, reading their minds and saying: ‘Think like this, not like this; pay attention like this, not like this; abandon this; having attained this, abide in it.’ When those thousand monks had been exhorted and admonished by Master Vessabhū, the <i lang="pi">arahant</i>, the fully Awakened One, their minds were freed from the corruptions without grasping. But if anyone not devoid of desire entered that frightening jungle-thicket, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.17"></a> usually their hair would stand on end. This is the reason why the spiritual life established by Master Vipassī, Master Sikhī, and Master Vessabhū did not last long.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.3.3"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.28"></a> “What then is the reason why the spiritual life established by Master Kakusandha, Master Konāgamana, and Master Kassapa lasted long?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.9"></a> “Master Kakusandha, Master Konāgamana, and Master Kassapa were diligent in teaching the Dhamma in detail to their disciples. They had many discourses in prose, and in prose and verse; many expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and analyses; and training rules were laid down and a <i lang="pi">pātimokkha</i> was recited. After the disappearance of those Buddhas, those Masters, after the disappearance of the disciples who were enlightened under them, those who were the last disciples—of various names, clans, and social standing, who had gone forth from various families—established that spiritual life for a long time. It’s just like flowers on a flat surface that are held together by a thread—they are not scattered about, whirled about, or destroyed by the wind. Why is that? Because they are held together by a thread. Even so, after the disappearance of those Buddhas, those Masters, after the disappearance of the disciples who were enlightened under them, those who were the last disciples established that spiritual life for a long time. This is the reason why the spiritual life established by Master Kakusandha, Master Konāgamana, and Master Kassapa lasted long.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.3.4"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.29"></a> Then Venerable Sāriputta got up from his seat, put his robe over one shoulder, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.18"></a> put the palms of his hands together, and said: “This is the right time, Master, to lay down training rules and recite a <i lang="pi">pātimokkha</i>, so that this spiritual life may last for a long time.”</p>
<p>“Hold on, Sāriputta, the Tathāgata will know the right time for that. The Teacher does not lay down training rules and recite a <i lang="pi">pātimokkha</i> until the causes of corruption appear in the Sangha. And they do not appear until the Sangha has attained long standing, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.19"></a> great size, or great learning. But when this happens, then the Teacher lays down training rules for his disciples <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.10"></a> and recites a <i lang="pi">pātimokkha</i> in order to ward off those causes of corruption. Sāriputta, the Sangha of monks is devoid of immorality, devoid of danger, stainless, pure, established in the essence. The most backward of these five hundred monks is a stream-enterer, not liable to rebirth in a state of misery, assured, bound for awakening.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.4"></a> <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.20"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.35"></a> Then the Master addressed Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, it’s the custom for Tathāgatas not to tour the country without having taken leave of those who invited them to spend the rains. Let’s go to the brahmin of Verañjā and take leave.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.36"></a> After dressing, the Master took his bowl and robe and, with Venerable Ānanda as his attendant, he went to the dwelling of that brahmin and sat down on the prepared seat. The brahmin approached the Master, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. And the Master said:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.11"></a> “Brahmin, having stayed for the rainy season according to your invitation, we are taking leave of you. We wish to depart for a tour of the country.”</p>
<p>“It’s true, good Gotama, that you have stayed for the rainy season according to my invitation, but I haven’t given a gift. That’s not good, and it’s not because I didn’t want to. It happened because household life is busy and there’s much to do. May the good Gotama consent to a meal tomorrow together with the Sangha of monks.”</p>
<p>The Master consented by keeping silent. Then the Master, after instructing, inspiring, and gladdening that brahmin with a talk on the Dhamma, rose from his seat, and departed. <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.37"></a> The following morning the brahmin prepared various kinds of delicious food in his own home, and then informed the Master: “It’s time, good Gotama, the meal is ready.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.38"></a> After dressing in the morning, the Master took his bowl and robe and, together with the Sangha of monks, he went to the dwelling of that brahmin and <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.21"></a> sat down on the prepared seat. With his own hands the brahmin served various kinds of delicious food to the Sangha of monks with the Buddha at its head. When they were satisfied and the Master had eaten and finished his meal, the brahmin gave a set of three robes to the Master and two pieces of cloth to each monk. The Master instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with talk on the Dhamma, and then rose from his seat and departed.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.39"></a> After remaining in Verañjā for as long as he liked, the Master travelled to Payāgapatiṭṭhāna via Soreyya, Saṅkassa, and Kaṇṇakujja. There he crossed the river Ganges and continued on to Benares. After remaining in Benares for as long as he liked, he set out for Vesālī on tour. Wandering on tour by stages, he arrived at Vesālī. There he stayed in the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.</p>
<p class="endsection"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.40"></a> The chapter on Verañjā is finished.</p>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<h3>First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.1.5"></a> <a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.5.1"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.41"></a> At one time Sudinna, the son of a prominent merchant, lived in a village called Kalandaka not far from Vesālī. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.22"></a> On one occasion Sudinna went to Vesālī on some <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.12"></a> business together with many friends. At that time the Master was seated teaching the Dhamma, surrounded by a great assembly of people. When Sudinna saw this he thought: “Perhaps I should listen to the Dhamma?” Then Sudinna approached the assembly and sat down to one side.</p>
<div class="sutta-parallel">
<p>As he was sitting there, Sudinna thought: “So far as I understand the Dhamma taught by the Master, it’s not easy for one who lives in a house to lead the spiritual life which is utterly perfect and pure as a polished conch shell. Perhaps I should cut off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robes, and go forth from home into homelessness?”</p>
<p>When the crowd had been instructed, inspired, gladdened, and delighted by the Master with a Dhamma talk, they rose from their seats, paid homage to the Master, circumambulated him with their right side towards him, and departed. <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.42"></a> When the crowd had departed, Sudinna approached the Master, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. He then said to the Master:</p>
<p>“Master, so far as I understand the Dhamma taught by the Master, it’s not easy for one who lives in a house to lead the spiritual life which is utterly perfect and pure as a polished conch shell. I wish to cut off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robes, and go forth from home into homelessness. Master, please give me the going forth.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.23"></a> “But, Sudinna, do you have your parents’ permission?”</p>
<p>“No, Master.”</p>
<p>“Sudinna, Tathāgatas do not ordain a child without the parents’ permission.”</p>
<p>“I will do whatever is necessary, Master, to get my parents’ permission.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.5.2"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.43"></a> Then, after finishing his business in Vesālī, Sudinna returned to Kalandaka. There he approached his parents and said: “Mother and father, so far as I understand the Dhamma taught by the Master, it’s not easy for one who lives in a house to lead the spiritual life which is utterly perfect and pure as a polished conch shell. I wish to cut off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robes, and go forth from home <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.13"></a> into homelessness. Give me permission to go forth.”</p>
<p>His parents replied: “But, Sudinna, you are our only child, dear and beloved; you live in comfort and are well cared for. You have no experience of suffering. Even if you died we would not willingly be without you. So how can we allow you to go forth from home into homelessness while you are still living?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.44"></a> Sudinna asked his parents a second and a third time, but got the same reply.<a class="ms-pa" id="ms.46"></a> He then lay down on the bare ground and said: “I will either die right here or go forth.” And he did not eat <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.24"></a> at the next seven meals.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.47"></a> His parents said: “Dear Sudinna, you are our only child, dear and beloved. You live in comfort and are well cared for; you have no experience of suffering. Even if you died we would not willingly be without you. So how can we allow you to go forth from home into homelessness while you are still living? Get up, Sudinna, eat, drink, and amuse yourself. Enjoy sensual pleasures and do acts of merit. We do not allow you to go forth.” But Sudinna did not respond.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.48"></a> His parents said the same thing a second and a third time, but Sudinna remained silent.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.5.3"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.49"></a> Then the friends of Sudinna approached him and said: “Sudinna, you are your <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.14"></a> parents’ only child, dear and beloved. You live in comfort and are well cared for; you have no experience of suffering. Even if you died your parents would not willingly be without you. So how can they allow you to go forth while you are still living? Get up, Sudinna, eat, drink, and amuse yourself. Enjoy sensual pleasures and do acts of merit. Your parents <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.25"></a> will not allow you to go forth.” But Sudinna did not respond.</p>
<p>Sudinna’s friends repeated their request a second and a third time, but Sudinna remained silent.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.5.4"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.50"></a> Sudinna’s friends approached his parents and said: “Sudinna says he will either die right there on the bare ground or go forth. If you do not allow him to go forth, he will die there. But if you allow him to go forth, you will see him again afterwards. And if he does not enjoy the going forth, what alternative will he have but to come back here? Allow Sudinna to go forth.”</p>
<p>“We allow him,” they said.</p>
<p>And Sudinna’s friends said to him: “Get up, Sudinna, your parents allow you to go forth from home into homelessness.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.51"></a> Sudinna thought: “They say that my parents will allow me to go forth.” And he rose, joyful, delighted, and elated, stroking his limbs with his hands. After spending a few days to regain his strength, he went to the Master, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. He then said: “Master, I am permitted by my parents to go forth from home into homelessness. Please give me the going forth.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.15"></a></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.26"></a> Sudinna received the going forth in the presence of the Master, and he received the full ordination. Not long afterwards Venerable Sudinna practised these kinds of ascetic practises: living in the wilderness, going on alms-round, wearing rags, going on continuous alms-round; and he lived in dependence on a certain village of the Vajjians.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.5.5"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.52"></a> At that time the Vajjians were short of food and stricken by hunger, with crops blighted and turned to straw, and it was not easy to keep oneself going by collecting alms. Venerable Sudinna considered this and thought: “I have many relations in Vesālī who are rich. Perhaps I should live in dependence on them? Because of me my relatives will be able to make offerings and make merit, the monks will obtain requisites, and I will not go short of almsfood.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.53"></a> Venerable Sudinna put his lodging in order, took his bowl and robe, and set out for Vesālī, where he arrived by travelling in stages. There Venerable Sudinna stayed in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. The relations of Venerable Sudinna heard that he <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.27"></a> had arrived in Vesālī and they brought him sixty offerings of barley. Venerable Sudinna gave the offerings of barley to the monks and, taking his bowl and robe, he entered the village of Kalandaka for alms. As he was going on continuous alms-round in Kalandaka, he came to his own father’s house.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.5.6"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.54"></a> At that time a female slave of Venerable Sudinna’s relations wanted to throw away the previous evening’s porridge. Venerable Sudinna said to her: “If that is to be thrown away, sister, put it here in my bowl.”</p>
<p>As she was putting the porridge into his bowl, she recognised his hands, feet, and voice. She then went to his mother and said: “Please know, madam, that the young master Sudinna is back.”</p>
<p>“If you speak the truth, I will make you a free woman!”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.55"></a> Just as Venerable Sudinna was eating the previous evening’s porridge at the base of a certain wall, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.16"></a> his father, coming from work, saw him. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.28"></a> He approached him and said: “But, Sudinna, isn’t there … and you are eating old porridge! Isn’t there your own home to go to?”</p>
<p>“We went to your house, householder. That’s where we received this porridge.”</p>
<p>Venerable Sudinna’s father took him by the arm and said: “Come, let’s go to the house.”</p>
<p>Venerable Sudinna went to his own father’s house and sat down on a prepared seat. His father said to him: “Eat, Sudinna.”</p>
<p>“There is no need, householder, I have finished eating for today.”</p>
<p>“Then please come back for the meal tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Venerable Sudinna consented by keeping silent, and he rose from his seat and departed.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.56"></a> Then Venerable Sudinna’s mother had the ground smeared with fresh cow-dung and made two heaps gold.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.29"></a> The heaps were so large that a man standing on one side could not see a man standing on the other. Hiding the heaps with screens and preparing a seat between them surrounded by a curtain, she addressed Venerable Sudinna’s former wife: “Daughter-in-law, adorn yourself in the way <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.30"></a> that our son Sudinna found you especially attractive.”</p>
<p>“Yes, madam,” she responded.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.5.7"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.57"></a> Then, in the morning, Venerable Sudinna dressed, took his bowl and robe and went to his father’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat. His father approached him, uncovered the heaps and said:</p>
<p>“This dowry, dear Sudinna, the fortune from your mother, is yours. Another is the fortune from your father and another the fortune from your ancestors. It’s possible, Sudinna, to return to the low life, enjoy wealth, and make merit. Come, Sudinna, please <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.17"></a> do so.”</p>
<p>“I’m not able to do so, father. I’m enjoying the spiritual life.”</p>
<p>Venerable Sudinna’s father repeated his request a second and a third time. Venerable Sudinna replied: “If you wouldn’t get offended, householder, I could tell you what to do.”</p>
<p>“Speak, Sudinna.”</p>
<p>“Well then, householder, make some large bags of hemp-cloth, put all the gold inside, take it all away <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.31"></a> in carts, and dump it in the middle of the Ganges. And why? Because that way you would avoid the danger, fear, terror, and (trouble with) protection that it will cause you.”</p>
<p>His father became displeased and thought, “How can our son Sudinna speak like this!” <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.58"></a> He then addressed Venerable Sudinna’s former wife: “Well now, daughter-in-law, since you were dear to him, perhaps our son Sudinna will listen to you.”</p>
<p>The former wife of Venerable Sudinna took hold of his feet and said: “What are these nymphs like, my lord’s son, for which you lead the spiritual life?”</p>
<p>“I don’t lead the spiritual life, sister, for the sake of nymphs.”</p>
<p>His former wife thought: “From today my lord’s son calls me ‘sister’,” and she fainted on the spot.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.5.8"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.59"></a> Venerable Sudinna said to his father: “If there is food to be given, householder, give it, but do not annoy me.”</p>
<p>“Eat, Sudinna,” he said.</p>
<p>Then, with their own hands, Venerable Sudinna’s mother and father served and satisfied him with various kinds of delicious food.</p>
</div>
<p>When Venerable Sudinna had finished his meal, his mother said to him: “This family, dear Sudinna, is rich. It’s possible, Sudinna, to return to the low life, enjoy wealth, and make <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.32"></a> merit. Come, Sudinna, please do so.”</p>
<p>“Mother, I can’t. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.18"></a> I’m enjoying the spiritual life.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.60"></a> His mother repeated her request a second time and then said this: “This family, Sudinna, is rich. Please beget offspring; don’t let the Licchavis take over our heirless property.”</p>
<p>“It’s possible for me to do this, mother.”</p>
<p>“Where are you staying at present?”</p>
<p>“In the Great Wood.” And he rose from his seat and departed.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.5.9"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.61"></a> The mother of Venerable Sudinna addressed his former wife: “Daughter-in-law, as soon as you menstruate, please tell me.”</p>
<p>“Very well, madam,” she replied. Not long afterwards Venerable Sudinna’s former wife menstruated, and she reported it to Venerable Sudinna’s mother.</p>
<p>“Daughter-in-law, adorn yourself in the way that our son Sudinna found you especially attractive.”</p>
<p>“Very well, madam,” she replied.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.33"></a> Then Venerable Sudinna’s mother, together with his former wife, approached Venerable Sudinna in the Great Wood, and she said to him: <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.62"></a> “This family, dear Sudinna, is rich. Please beget offspring; don’t let the Licchavis take over our heirless property.”</p>
<p>“It’s possible for me to do this, mother,” he said. He then took his former wife by the arm, plunged into the Great Wood and—there being no training rule and he seeing no danger—had sexual intercourse with her three times. As a result she conceived.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.63"></a> The earth-gods cried out: “Good sirs, the Sangha of monks has been healthy and free from danger. But Sudinna the Kalandaka has produced a tumour, has produced danger.”</p>
<p>The gods belonging to the heaven of the four great kings hearing the cry of the earth-gods in turn cried out … the Tāvatiṁsa gods … the Yāma gods … the Tusita gods … the gods who delight in creation … <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.19"></a> the gods who control the creation of others … the gods belonging to the retinue of the supreme beings in turn cried out:</p>
<p>“Good sirs, the Sangha of monks has been healthy and free from danger. But Sudinna the Kalandaka has produced a tumour, has produced danger.” Thus in that moment, in that instance, the news spread as far as the world of the supreme beings.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.64"></a> The pregnancy of Venerable Sudinna’s wife developed and she eventually gave birth to a son. The friends of Venerable Sudinna called this boy Bījaka; they called Venerable Sudinna’s former wife Bījaka’s mother; and they called Venerable <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.34"></a> Sudinna Bījaka’s father. After some time they both went forth from home into homelessness, and they realised <i lang="pi">arahantship</i>.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.5.10"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.65"></a> But Venerable Sudinna was anxious and remorseful, and he thought: “This is truly bad for me, that after going forth in such a well-proclaimed Dhamma and training, I wasn’t able for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life.” And because of his anxiety and remorse, he became thin, haggard, and pale, his veins protruding all over his limbs; he became sad, sluggish, miserable, depressed, remorseful, weighed down with grief.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.66"></a> The monks who were Venerable Sudinna’s friends said to him: “Formerly, Sudinna, you were handsome, your features rounded, your face a good colour, your skin clear. But now you’re thin, haggard, and pale, your veins protruding all over your limbs; and you’re sad, sluggish, miserable, depressed, remorseful, weighed down with grief. Could it be that you lead the spiritual life dissatisfied?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.67"></a> “I don’t lead the spiritual life dissatisfied. I’ve done a bad deed. I’ve had sexual intercourse with my former wife. That is why I’m so miserable. I wasn’t able for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.68"></a> “Sudinna, no wonder you’re anxious, no wonder you feel remorse, in that having gone forth in such a well-proclaimed Dhamma and training you were not able for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.35"></a> Isn’t the Dhamma taught by the Master in various ways for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion; for the sake of freedom from bondage, not for the sake of bondage; for the sake of non-grasping, not for the sake of grasping? When the Dhamma is taught by the Master in this way, how can you be intent upon passion, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.20"></a> bondage, and grasping? Hasn’t the Dhamma been taught in many ways by the Master for the waning of passion, for the subduing of intoxication, for the restraint of desire, for the abolition of clinging, for the annihilation of the round of existence, for the destruction of craving, for fading away, for cessation, for extinguishment? Hasn’t the abandoning of sense pleasures been declared in many ways by the Master, the full understanding of the perception of sense pleasures, the abolishing of thirst for sense pleasures, the elimination of thoughts of sense pleasures, the stilling of the fever of sense pleasures? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it, nor increase the confidence of those who have it, but it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.5.11"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.69"></a> After rebuking Venerable Sudinna in various way, those monks informed the Master. The Master then convened the Sangha and questioned Venerable Sudinna:<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.36"></a> “Is it true, Sudinna, that you had sexual intercourse with your former wife?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.70"></a> The Buddha, the Master, rebuked him: “Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not becoming, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could you go forth in such a well-proclaimed Dhamma and training and not be able for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life? Haven’t I taught the Dhamma in many ways for the sake of dispassion … the stilling of the fever of sense pleasures? It would be better, foolish man, for your penis to enter the mouth of a terrible and poisonous snake than to enter a woman. It would be better for your penis to enter the mouth of a black snake than to enter a woman. It would be better for your penis to enter a blazing charcoal pit than to enter a woman. Why is that? Because for that reason you might die or experience deadly suffering, but you would not because of that be reborn in a bad destination. But for <em>this</em> reason you might.<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.21"></a> Foolish man, you have practised what is contrary to the true Dhamma, the common <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.37"></a> practice, the low practice, the coarse practice, that which ends with a wash, that which is done in private, that which is done wherever there are couples. You are the forerunner, the first performer of many unwholesome things. This will not give rise to confidence in those without it, nor increase the confidence of those who have it, but it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.71"></a> Then the Master spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support and maintain, in dispraise of great desires, lack of contentment, socialising, and laziness; but he spoke in praise in various ways of being easy to support and maintain, of desiring little, contentment, self-effacement, ascetic practices, serenity, decrease of defilements, and of the putting forth of energy. After giving a Dhamma talk on what is right and seemly, he addressed the monks:</p>
<p>“Because of this, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the monks for the following ten reasons: for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of recalcitrant people, for the ease <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.38"></a> of well-behaved monks, for the restraint of corruptions that pertain to the present life and for warding off corruptions that pertain to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it and to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the continuation of the true Dhamma and for supporting the training.</p>
<p>“And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3>First preliminary ruling</h3>
<p class="subrule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.72"></a> “If a monk has sexual intercourse, he is expelled and not in communion.”</p>
<p class="end"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.73"></a> In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<p class="end"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.74"></a> The section on Sudinna is finished.</p>
<h3>Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.6"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.75"></a> At one time a certain monk in the Great Wood near Vesālī befriended a female monkey by giving her food, and he had sexual intercourse with her. Then, in the morning, he dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Vesālī for alms.</p>
<p>Just then a number of monks who were touring the lodgings came to this monk’s dwelling. The female monkey saw the monks coming, and she went up to them, shook her buttocks in front of them, wagged her tail, presented her buttocks, and made a gesture. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.22"></a> The <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.39"></a> monks thought: “Undoubtedly this monk is having sexual intercourse with this monkey,” and they hid to one side. Then, when that monk had finished his alms-round in Vesālī and had returned with his almsfood, <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.77"></a> he ate one part himself and gave the rest to the female monkey. After eating the food, the monkey presented her buttocks to the monk, and he had sexual intercourse with her.</p>
<p>Those monks said to that monk: “Hasn’t a training rule been laid down by the Master? Why then do you have sexual intercourse with a monkey?”</p>
<p>“It’s true that a training rule has been laid down by the Master, but it refers to human women, not to animals.”</p>
<p>“But that’s just the same. It’s not suitable, it’s not becoming, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could you go forth in this well-proclaimed Dhamma and training and not be able for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life? Hasn’t the Dhamma been taught in various ways by the Master for the sake of dispassion … the stilling of the fever of sense pleasures? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.”</p>
<p>After rebuking that monk in various ways, they informed the Master. <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.78"></a> The Master then convened the Sangha and questioned that monk: “Is it true, monk, that you had sexual intercourse with a monkey?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked him: “Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not becoming, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could you go forth in such a well-proclaimed Dhamma and training and not be able for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life? Haven’t I taught the Dhamma in many ways for the sake of dispassion … <span class="add">As in  <a href="/en/pi-tv-bu-vb-pj#Bu-Pj.1.5.11">Bu-Pj.1.5.11</a> above, with appropriate changes</span> … Foolish <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.40"></a> man, this will not give rise to confidence in those without it …</p>
<p>And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3>Second preliminary ruling</h3>
<p class="subrule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.79"></a> “If a monk has sexual intercourse, even with an animal, he is expelled and not in communion.”</p>
<p class="end"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.80"></a> In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<p class="end"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.81"></a> The story of the female monkey is finished.</p>
<h3>Third sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.1.7.1"></a> <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.23"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.82"></a> At that time a number of Vajjian monks from Vesālī ate, slept, and bathed as much as they liked. Doing so, and not reflecting properly, they had sexual intercourse, without first renouncing the training and revealing their weakness. After some time they were affected by loss of relatives, loss of property, and illness. They approached Venerable Ānanda and said:</p>
<p>“Bhante Ānanda, we do not blame the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Sangha; we <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.41"></a> only blame ourselves. We were unfortunate, we had little merit: after going forth in such a well-proclaimed Dhamma and training, we were unable for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life. If we were now to obtain the going forth and the full ordination in the presence of the Master, we would have clarity about wholesome qualities and would be devoted day after day to developing the aids to awakening. Bhante Ānanda, please inform the Master of this matter.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he replied. And he went to the Master and informed him.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.83"></a> “It’s impossible, Ānanda, that the Tathāgata should abolish a training rule that entails expulsion because of the Vajjians.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.84"></a> The Master then spoke on the Dhamma and addressed the monks: <span class="subrule">“Monks, if a monk, without first renouncing the training and revealing his weakness, has sexual intercourse, he may not receive the full ordination. But, monks, if someone has sexual intercourse after first renouncing the training and revealing his weakness, he may receive the full ordination.</span></p>
<p>“And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.85"></a> “If a monk, after taking on the monks’ training and way <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.42"></a> of life, without first renouncing the training and revealing his weakness, has sexual intercourse, even with an animal, he is expelled and not in communion.”</p>
