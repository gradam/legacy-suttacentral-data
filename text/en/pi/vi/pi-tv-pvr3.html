Impermanent are all constructs, painful, not self, and constructed,<br>
And certainly <i lang="pi">nibbāna</i> is a description meaning not-self.</p>
<p>When the moon of the Buddha has not appeared, <br>
when the sun of the Buddha has not risen<br>
The very name of those rules held in common is not known.</p>
<p>When they have performed various austerities, <br>
and have fulfilled the perfections,<br>
The Great Heroes uprise, having become Vision <br>
in the world with the Brahmās;</p>
<p>They teach True <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i>: the slaying of anguish, the bringing of happiness.<br>
Aṅgīrasa the Sakyan Sage, compassionate for all beings,</p>
<p>The best of all creatures, the lion, taught the three Piṭakas:<br>
The Suttantas, the Abhidhamma, and the Vinaya—a great special quality.</p>
<p>Thus is True <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> led on if Vinaya endures.<br>
The two Analyses, the Khandhakas, and the Headings</p>
<p>Are garlands fastened by Parivāra which is just a strand in the Thread.<br>
For this Parivāra itself “origin” is regularized,</p>
<p>And in the Thread below division and source are shown as different.<br>
Therefore “He who is well behaved and desires the rule <br>
must train in Parivāra”.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.124" href="#BD.6.124"></a>
At the Observance they recite what was laid down in the two Analyses,<br>
(Saying) I will declare the origin according to the method: listen to me.</p>
<p>That which is the First Defeat, and next the Second,<br>
A Go-between and Admonishment and an Extra Robe,</p>
<p>Wools, <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i>-line-by-line, Fact, and Arranging,<br>
Set on Theft, Teaching, and Woman Thief, Without Consent are thirteen.</p>
<p>These thirteen were thought out by learned men according to the Origin-method: <br>
In each the origins are shown to be the same.</p>
<p>Intercourse, semen, contact, the first Undetermined (offence),<br>
Arrived first, procured through (the intervention), together with a nun in
private,</p>
<p>With food, and two in private, the fingers, sporting in the water,
<br>
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi5.87" href="#Vin.5.87"></a>
A blow, also raising, and fifty-three Trainings,</p>
<p>Below the collar-bone, village, full of desire, palm, and application,
ablution,<br>
Having kept the rains, and exhortation, on not waiting on a woman instructor.</p>
<p>These trainings are seventy-six done by body and by thought,<br>
All are from one origin as is the First Defeat.</p>

Unfounded, belonging to something else, <br>
the second Undetermined (offence),</p>
<p>Should tear away, should apportion, lying, insult, slander,<br>
Very bad, should dig the ground, growth, in evasion, <br>
in making look down on,</p>
<p>Throwing out, and sprinkling, sake of gain, having eaten,<br>
“Come”, in disrespect, should frighten, and should hide, living thing,</p>
<p>Knowing it contains living things, (formal) act, <br>
under (twenty), in communion, expulsion,<br>
Regarding a rule, perplexity, confusion, <br>
and with an unfounded charge,</p>
<p>Remorse, legitimate, having given (away), <br>
should apportion to an individual,<br>
“What to you?”, not at a right time, should tear away, <br>
misapprehension, and with Niraya,</p>

And three on a maiden, less than twelve, not agreed on,</p>
<p>Sufficiently, dwelling-place of grief, favoritism, and every year, two:<br>
These are seventy rules of training, done triad-wise as to origin:</p>
<p>By body and mind, not speech; speech and mind, not bodily,<br>
They arise by three doors as does the Second Defeat.</p>

Two on remains of food, and cloths, and about recluses’ robe-material:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.127" href="#BD.6.127"></a>
Thou understandeth that these offences may arise by six causal occasions:<br>
By body, not by speech or mind; by speech, not by body or thought,</p>
<p>By body and speech, but not by mind; by body and mind, not by speech;
<br>
