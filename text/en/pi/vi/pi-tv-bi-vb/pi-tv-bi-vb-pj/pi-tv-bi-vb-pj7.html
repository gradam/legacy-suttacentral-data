… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the nun Thullanandā imitated the monk Ariṭṭha who had formerly been a
vulture-trainer, and who was suspended by a complete Order. Those who were
modest nuns … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the lady Thullanandā imitate the monk … suspended by a complete
Order?” … “It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā imitate the monk … suspended by a complete
Order? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And
thus, monks, let the nuns set forth this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should imitate him—a monk suspended by a complete Order, one who
is disrespectful towards, who does not make amends towards, one who is
unfriendly towards the rule, the discipline, the teacher’s instruction—that nun
should be spoken to thus by the nuns: ‘Lady, this monk, suspended by a complete
Order, is disrespectful towards, he does not make amends towards, he is
unfriendly towards the rule, the discipline, the teacher’s instruction. Do not
imitate this monk, lady.’ And if this nun, being spoken to thus by <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.170" href="#BD.3.170"></a>
these nuns, should persist as before, that nun should be admonished by the nuns
up to the third time for giving up this (course). If, being admonished up to
the third time, she should give it up, that is good. But if she should not give
it up, she also becomes one who is defeated, she is not in communion, she is an
imitator of one who is suspended.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Complete Order</span> means:
<span class="gloss">belonging to the same communion, staying within the same boundary.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Suspended</span> means:
<span class="gloss">suspended for not seeing or for not making amends for or for not giving up an
offence.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Towards the rule, the discipline</span> means:
<span class="gloss">towards whatever is the rule, whatever is the discipline.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Towards the teacher’s instruction</span> means:
<span class="gloss">towards the conqueror’s instruction, the enlightened one’s instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Disrespectful</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he does not heed an Order or a group or an individual or a (formal) act.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Does not make amends towards</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he is suspended, not restored.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Unfriendly towards</span> means:
<span class="gloss">monks belonging to the same communion are called friends. He who is not
together with these is therefore called unfriendly.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should imitate him</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he becomes one of such views, of such indulgence, of such pleasures, she too
becomes one of those views, of that indulgence, of those pleasures.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">That nun</span> means:
<span class="gloss">whatever nun is an imitator of one who is suspended.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">By the nuns</span> means:
<span class="gloss">by other nuns: these sec, these <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.171" href="#BD.3.171"></a>
hear; she should be told by these saying: ‘Lady, this monk, suspended by a
complete Order, … do not imitate this monk, lady.’ And a second time she should
be told … And a third time she should be told … If she gives it up, that is
good; if she does not give it up, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If,
having heard, they do not speak, there is an offence of wrong-doing. That nun,
having been pulled into the midst of the Order, should be told: ‘Lady, this
monk, suspended by a complete Order, … do not imitate this monk, lady.’ And a
second time … And a third time she should be told … If she gives it up, that is
good; if she does not give it up, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">That nun should be admonished</span>. And thus, monks, should she be admonished: the Order should be informed by an
experienced, competent nun, saying: <span class="kamma">‘Ladies, let the Order listen to me. This nun so and so imitated a monk
suspended by a complete Order, one who is disrespectful towards, who does not
make amends towards, who is unfriendly towards the rule, the discipline, the
teacher’s instruction. She does not give up this course. If it seems right to
the Order, let the Order admonish the nun so and so in order that she may give
up this course. This is the motion. Ladies, let the Order listen to me. This
nun so and so … She does not give up this course. The Order admonishes the nun
so and so in order that she may give up this course. If the admonishing of the
nun so and so in order that she may give up this course is pleasing to the
ladies, let them be silent; if it is not pleasing, then you should speak. And a
second time I speak forth this matter … And a third time I speak forth this
matter … The nun so and so is admonished by the Order for giving up this
course. It is pleasing to the Order … So do I understand this.’</span></p>
<p>As a result of the motion there is an offence of wrong-doing; as a result of
two proclamations there are grave offences; at the end of the proclamations,
there is an offence involving defeat.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.172" href="#BD.3.172"></a>
<span class="term">She also</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she is so called in reference to the former.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">She becomes one who is defeated</span> means:
<span class="gloss">as a flat stone broken in half cannot be put together again, so a nun, being
admonished up to the third time, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.220" href="#Vin.4.220"></a>
not giving it up, becomes one who is not a (true) recluse, not a daughter of
the Sakyans</span>; therefore she is called
<span class="term">she becomes one who is defeated</span>.</p>
<p><span class="term">Not in communion</span> means:
<span class="gloss">communion …</span> is therefore called
<span class="term">not in communion</span>.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pj.7.2.2" href="#Bi-Pj.7.2.2"></a>
If she thinks that it is a legally valid act when it is a legally valid act
(and) does not give it up, there is an offence involving defeat. If she is in
doubt as to whether it is a legally valid act (and) does not give it up, there
is an offence involving defeat. If she thinks that it is not a legally valid
act when it is a legally valid act (and) does not give it up, there is an
offence involving defeat. If she thinks that it is a legally valid act when it
is not a legally valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in
doubt as to whether it is not a legally valid act, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If she thinks that it is not a legally valid act when it is not a
legally valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pj.7.2.3" href="#Bi-Pj.7.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she is not admonished; if she gives it up, if she is
mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
