… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the nun Thullanandā, having exchanged a robe with a certain nun, made use of
it. Then that nun, having folded up that robe, laid it aside. The nun
Thullanandā spoke thus to that nun: “Lady, that robe <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.247" href="#Vin.4.247"></a>
which was exchanged by you with me, where is that robe?” Then that nun, having
taken out that robe, showed it to the nun Thullanandā. The nun Thullanandā
spoke thus to that nun: “Lady, take back your robe, give me this robe. That
which is yours is yours, that which is mine is mine. Give this to me, take away
your own,” and she tore it away. Then that nun told this matter to the nuns …
to the monks. The monks … to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā … tore it away?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can the nun
Thullanandā … tear it away? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not
(yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, having exchanged a robe with a nun, should afterwards speak thus:
‘Lady, take your robe, give this robe to me. That which is yours is yours, that
which is mine is mine. Give this to me, take away <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.221" href="#BD.3.221"></a>
your own,’ (and) should tear it away or should cause (another) to tear it away,
there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.</span>”</p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:

<p><span class="term">With a nun</span> means:

<p><span class="term">Robe</span> means:
<span class="gloss">any one robe of the six (kinds of) robes (including) the least one fit for
assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Having exchanged</span> means:
<span class="gloss">something large for something small or something small for something large.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should tear it away</span> means: if she tears it away herself, there is an offence of’ expiation
involving forfeiture.</p>
<p><span class="term">Should cause (another) to tear it away</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if she commands another, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If having
commanded once, she then tears many away, it is to be forfeited. It should be
forfeited to an Order or to a group or to one nun. And thus, monks, should it
be forfeited: <span class="kamma">‘Ladies, having exchanged this robe with a nun, it was torn away by me; it is
to be forfeited. I forfeit it to the Order’</span> …
<span class="kamma">‘the Order should give back … let the ladies give back … I will give back (this
robe) to the lady.’</span></span></p>

If she thinks that she is ordained when she is ordained, (and) having exchanged
a robe, tears it away or causes (another) to tear it away, there is an offence
of expiation involving forfeiture. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.248" href="#Vin.4.248"></a>
If she is in doubt as to whether she is ordained … If she thinks that she is
not ordained when she is ordained … involving forfeiture. Having exchanged
another requisite, if she tears it away or causes (another) to tear it away,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. Having exchanged a robe or another
requisite with one who is not ordained, if she tears it away or causes
(another) to tear it away, there <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.222" href="#BD.3.222"></a>
is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is ordained when she is
not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to
whether she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks
that she is not ordained when she is not ordained, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-NP.3.2.3" href="#Bi-NP.3.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she gives it or takes it from her in a friendly manner;
if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
