… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
nuns dwelling in cells belonging to a certain guild were going short of conjey.
Then that guild, having made a voluntary collection for conjey for the nuns,
having laid aside what was necessary in a certain shop-keeper’s house, having
approached the nuns, spoke thus: “Ladies, in such and such a shopkeeper’s house
what is necessary for conjey is laid aside. Having had husked rice brought from
there, having had the conjey boiled, make use of it.”</p>
<p>The nuns, having got medicine in exchange for what was necessary, made use of
it. Then that guild, having found out … spread it about, saying: “How can these
nuns get something in exchange for what was necessary (and) appointed for
another thing, destined for another thing, belonging to a company?”</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns got something in exchange … belonging
to a company?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.253" href="#Vin.4.253"></a>
</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can nuns get
something in exchange … belonging to a company? It is not, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.234" href="#BD.3.234"></a>
monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should get something in exchange for what was necessary (and)
appointed for another thing, destined for another thing, belonging to a
company, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>
