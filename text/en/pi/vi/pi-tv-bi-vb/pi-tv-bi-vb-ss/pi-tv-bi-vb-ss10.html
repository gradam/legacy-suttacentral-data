… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the nun Caṇḍakālī, having quarrelled with nuns, angry, displeased, spoke thus:
“I repudiate the enlightened one, I repudiate <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, I repudiate the Order, I repudiate the training. What indeed are these
recluses who are recluses, daughters of the Sakyans? For there are other
recluses, conscientious, scrupulous, desirous of training; I will lead the
Brahma-life among these.” Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:
“How can the lady Caṇḍakālī, a nun, angry, displeased, speak thus: ‘I repudiate
… I will lead the Brahma-life among these’?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Caṇḍakālī, angry, displeased,
spoke thus: ‘I repudiate … I will lead the Brahma-life among these’?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Caṇḍakālī, angry, displeased, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.236" href="#Vin.4.236"></a>
speak thus: ‘I repudiate … I will lead the Brahma-life among these’? It is not,
monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, angry, displeased, should speak thus: ‘I repudiate the
enlightened one … I repudiate the training. What indeed are these recluses who
are recluses, daughters of the Sakyans? For there are other recluses,
conscientious, scrupulous,’ desirous of training; I will lead the Brahma-life
among these,’ that nun should be spoken to thus by the nuns: ‘Do <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.202" href="#BD.3.202"></a>
not, lady, angry, displeased, speak thus: “I repudiate the enlightened one … I
will lead the Brahma-life among these.” Be satisfied, lady, <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> is well preached, lead the Brahma-life for the utter ending of ill.’ And if
that nun, being spoken to thus by the nuns, persists as before, that nun should
be admonished by the nuns up to a third time for giving up that (course). If,
being admonished up to a third time, she should give it up, that is good. If
she should not give it up, that nun also has fallen into a matter that is an
offence on the third (admonition), entailing a formal meeting of the Order
involving being sent away.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bi-Ss.10.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Ss.10.2.1" href="#Bi-Ss.10.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Angry, displeased</span> means:
<span class="gloss">dissatisfied, the mind worsened, stubborn.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should speak thus</span> means:
<span class="gloss">‘I repudiate … I will lead the Brahma-life among these.’</span></p>
<p><span class="term">That nun</span> means:
<span class="gloss">whatever nun speaks thus.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">By the nuns</span> means:
<span class="gloss">by other nuns who see, who hear; she should be told by these: “Do not, lady,
angry, displeased … for the utter ending of ill.” And a second time she should
be told, and a third time she should be told. If she gives it up, that is good.
If she does not give it up, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If, having
heard, they do not speak, there is an offence of wrong-doing. And that nun,
having been pulled into the midst of the Order, should be told: <span class="kamma">“Do not, lady, angry, displeased, speak thus: ‘I repudiate the enlightened one,
I repudiate, <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, I repudiate the Order, I repudiate the training … I will lead the Brahma-life
among these.’ Be satisfied, lady, … lead the Brahma-life for the utter ending
of ill.”</span> And a second time she should be told, and a third time she
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.203" href="#BD.3.203"></a>
should be told. If she gives it up, that is good. If she does not give it up,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. That nun should be admonished. And thus,
monks should she be admonished: the Order should be informed by an experienced,
competent nun, saying: <span class="kamma">“Ladies, let the Order listen to me. This nun so and so, angry, displeased,
spoke thus: ‘I repudiate … I will lead the Brahma-life among these.’ She does
not give up this course. If it seems right to the Order, let the Order admonish
the nun so and so <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.237" href="#Vin.4.237"></a>
for giving up this course. This is the motion. Ladies, let the Order listen to
me. This nun so and so … She does not give up this course. The Order admonishes
the nun so and so for the giving up of this course. If the admonition of the mm
so and so for the giving up of this course is pleasing to the ladies, let them
be silent. If it is not pleasing, then you should speak. And a second time I
speak forth this matter … And a third time I speak forth this matter … The nun
so and so is admonished by the Order for the giving up of this course. It is
pleasing … Thus do I understand this.”</span></span></p>
<p>As a result of the motion, there is an offence of wrong-doing; as a result of
two proclamations, there are grave offences. At the end of the proclamations,
there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order. If she is
committing an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order, the offence of
wrong-doing according to the motion and the grave offences according to the two
proclamations, subside.</p>
<p><span class="term">She also</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she is so called in reference to the former.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Up to the third time</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she falls on the third admonition, not through transgression of a course.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Involving being sent away</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she is caused to be sent away by the Order.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order</span> means:
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.204" href="#BD.3.204"></a>
<span class="gloss">… therefore again it is called an offence entailing a formal meeting of the
Order.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Ss.10.2.2" href="#Bi-Ss.10.2.2"></a>
If she thinks that it is a legally valid act when it is a legally valid act
(and) does not give it up, there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of
the Order. If she is in doubt as to whether it is a legally valid act … If she
thinks that it is not a legally valid act when it is a legally valid act (and)
does not give it up, there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the
Order. If she thinks that it is a legally valid act when it is not a legally
valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether
it is not a legally valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she
thinks that it is not a legally valid act when it is not a legally valid act,
there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Ss.10.2.3" href="#Bi-Ss.10.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she is not admonished, if she gives it up; if she is
mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
