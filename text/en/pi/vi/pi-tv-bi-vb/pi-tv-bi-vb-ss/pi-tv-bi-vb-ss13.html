… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the nun Thullanandā, admonished by the Order, spoke thus to the nuns: “Ladies,
live you as though in company, do not you live otherwise. For there are in the
Order other nuns of such habits, of such repute, of such ways of living, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.241" href="#Vin.4.241"></a>
vexing the Order of nuns, concealing one another’s sins; the Order does not say
anything to these. It is to you yourselves that the Order, out of disrespect,
out of contempt, out of impatience, in gossiping, on poor evidence, says this:
‘Sisters are living in company, of evil habits, of evil repute, of evil ways of
living, vexing the Order of nuns, concealing one another’s sins. Let the ladies
desist; the Order praises this detachment in sisters.’” Those who were modest
nuns … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the lady Thullanandā, admonished by the Order, speak thus to nuns:
‘Ladies, live you as though in company … detachment in sisters” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā, admonished by the
Order, spoke thus to nuns: ‘Ladies, live you … detachment in sisters’?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā, admonished by the Order, speak thus to
nuns:’ Ladies, live you … praises this detachment in sisters’? It is not,
monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should speak thus: ‘Ladies, live you as <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.211" href="#BD.3.211"></a>
though in company, do not you live otherwise. For there are in the Order other
nuns of such habits, of such repute, of such ways of living, vexing the Order
of nuns, concealing one another’s sins; the Order does not say anything to
these. It is to you yourselves that the Order, out of disrespect, out of
contempt, out of impatience, in gossiping, on poor evidence, says this:
“Sisters are living in company, of evil habits, of evil repute, of evil ways of
living, vexing the Order of nuns, concealing one another’s sins. Let the ladies
desist, the Order praises this detachment in sisters,”’—that nun should be
spoken to thus by the nuns: ‘Do not, lady, speak thus: “Sisters are living in
company … detachment in sisters.”’ And if that nun, being spoken to thus by the
nuns, should persist as before, that nun should be admonished by the nuns up to
a third time for giving up that (course). If, being admonished up to a third
time, she should give it up, that is good. If she should not give it up, this
nun also has fallen into a matter that is an offence on the third (admonition),
entailing a formal meeting of the Order involving being sent away.”</span></p>

Recited, ladies, are the seventeen matters that are offences entailing a formal
meeting of the Order—nine which are offences at once, eight on the third
(admonition). A nun having fallen into one or other of these shall spend a
fortnight in <i lang="pi">mānatta</i> discipline before both Orders. If, when the nun has performed the <i lang="pi">mānatta</i> discipline, the Order of nuns should number twenty, then that nun may be
rehabilitated. But if the Order of nuns, numbering less than twenty even by
one, should rehabilitate that nun, that nun is not rehabilitated, and those
nuns are blameworthy; this is the proper course there. Concerning this, I ask
the ladies: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? And a second time I
ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? And a third time I ask: I
hope that you are quite pure in this matter? The ladies are quite pure in this
matter, therefore they are silent; thus do I understand this.</p>
