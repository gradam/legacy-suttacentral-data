… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
in Vesālī, the wife of a certain Licchavi came to be an adulteress. Then that
Licchavi spoke thus to that woman: “Please desist, else will we do you harm.”
But being spoken to thus, she paid no heed. Now at that time a group of
Licchavis were assembled in Vesālī on some business. Then that Licchavi spoke
thus to those Licchavis: “Let the masters allow me power over one woman.”</p>
<p>“What is her name?”</p>
<p>“My wife commits adultery, I will kill her.”</p>
<p>“Take your right,” they said. Then that woman heard: “My husband wants to kill
me,” and taking precious belongings, having gone to Sāvatthī, having approached
members of other sects, she asked for the going forth. The members of other
sects did not wish to let her go forth. Having approached nuns, she asked for
the going forth. Neither did the nuns wish to let her go forth. Having
approached the nun Thullanandā, having shown (her) the belongings, she asked
for the going forth. The nun Thullanandā, having taken the belongings, let her
go forth. Then that Licchavi, searching for that woman, having gone to
Sāvatthī, seeing her gone forth among the nuns, approached King Pasenadi of
Kosala; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.226" href="#Vin.4.226"></a>
having approached, he spoke thus to King Pasenadi of Kosala:</p>
<p>“Sire, my wife, taking precious belongings, has reached Sāvatthī; let the king
allow me power over her.”</p>
<p>“Well now, good sir, having examined (her), explain.”</p>
<p>“Sire, she was seen gone forth among the nuns.”</p>
<p>“If, good sir, she has gone forth among the nuns, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.183" href="#BD.3.183"></a>
there is nothing to do against her. Well preached by the lord is <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>; let her lead the Brahma-life for the utter ending of ill.”</p>
<p>Then that Licchavi, looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How
can these nuns let a woman thief go forth?”</p>
<p>Nuns heard that Licchavi who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns …
spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Thullanandā let a woman thief go
forth?” Then these nuns told this matter to the monks …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā let a thief go forth?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can the nun
Thullanandā let a woman thief go forth? It is not monks, for pleasing those who
are not (yet) pleased … let the nuns set forth this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should knowingly receive a woman thief found to merit death,
without having obtained permission from a king or an Order or a group or a
guild or a company, unless she is allowable, that nun <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.184" href="#BD.3.184"></a>
also has fallen into a matter that is an offence at once, entailing a formal
meeting of the Order involving being sent away.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bi-Ss.2.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Ss.2.2.1" href="#Bi-Ss.2.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood. </span></p>
<p><span class="term">She knows</span> means:
<span class="gloss">either she knows by herself or others tell her or she tells her.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Woman thief</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she who takes by means of theft (anything) having the value of five <i lang="pi">māsakas</i> or more than five <i lang="pi">māsakas</i> that has not been given—she is called a woman thief.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">To merit death</span> means:
<span class="gloss">having done that for which she is condemned to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Found</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she becomes known by other people, thinking, ‘This one merits death.’</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Without having obtained permission</span> means:
<span class="gloss">not asking (for permission).</span></p>
<p><span class="term">King</span> means:
<span class="gloss">where a king governs, the king’s permission should be obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Order</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is called an Order of nuns; the permission of the Order of nuns should be
obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Group</span> means:
<span class="gloss">where a group governs, the group’s permission should be obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Company</span> means:
<span class="gloss">where a company governs, the company’s permission should be obtained. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.227" href="#Vin.4.227"></a>
</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Unless she is allowable</span> means:
<span class="gloss">having set aside one who is allowable.</span>
<span class="term">Allowable</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there are two who are allowable: either she who has gone forth among members of
other sects, or she who has gone forth among other nuns.</span></p>
<p>If she thinks, “I will receive one, unless she is allowable,” and looks about
for a group or for a female teacher or for a bowl or for a robe or if she
determines a <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.185" href="#BD.3.185"></a>
boundary, there is an offence of wrong-doing. As a result of the motion, there
is an offence of wrong-doing. As a result of two proclamations, there are grave
offences. At the end of the proclamations, there is an offence involving a
formal meeting of the Order for the female preceptor, an offence of wrong-doing
for the group and for the female teacher.</p>
<p><span class="term">She also</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she is so called in reference to the former.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Offence at once</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… therefore again it is called an offence entailing a formal meeting of the
Order.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Ss.2.2.2" href="#Bi-Ss.2.2.2"></a>
If she thinks that she is a thief when she is a thief (and) receives her,
unless she is allowable, there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the
Order. If she is in doubt … offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is
not a thief when she is a thief … no offence. If she thinks that she is a thief
when she is not a thief, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt
as to whether she is not a thief, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she
thinks that she is not a thief when she is not a thief, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Ss.2.2.3" href="#Bi-Ss.2.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she receives her, not knowing; if she receives one, she
having obtained permission; if she receives one who is made allowable; if she
is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
