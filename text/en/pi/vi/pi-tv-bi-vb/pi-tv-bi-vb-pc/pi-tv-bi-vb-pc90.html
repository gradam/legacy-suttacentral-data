… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
nuns caused (themselves) to be rubbed (with ointment) and also caused
(themselves) to be massaged by a nun. People, engaged in touring the
dwelling-place, having seen (them), … spread it about, saying: “How can these
nuns cause (themselves) to be rubbed (with ointment) and also cause
(themselves) to be massaged by a nun, just like women householders who enjoy
pleasures of the senses?” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those
who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns cause
(themselves) to be rubbed … by a nun?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns caused (themselves) to be rubbed … by
a nun?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns cause (themselves) to be rubbed (with ointment) and also
cause themselves to be massaged by a nun? It is not, monks, for pleasing those
who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should cause (herself) to be rubbed (with ointment) or should
cause (herself) to be massaged by a nun, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

There is no offence if she is ill; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if
she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
