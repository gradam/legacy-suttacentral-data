… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
nuns, not seeing their own things, spoke thus to the nun Caṇḍakālī: “Has the
lady not seen our things?” The nun Caṇḍakālī … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“What, am I a thief then? What, am I just shameless? That these ladies, not
seeing their own things, spoke thus to me: ‘Has the lady not seen our things?’
If indeed, ladies, I take your things I am not a true recluse, I am falling
away from the Brahma-life, I rise up in hell. But whoever speaks thus of me
when it is not a fact, let her too be not a true recluse, let her fall away
from the Brahma-life, let her rise up in hell.”</p>
<p>Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the lady Caṇḍakālī curse herself as well as another with hell as well
as with the Brahma-life?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Caṇḍakālī cursed herself … with
the Brahma-life?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Caṇḍakālī curse herself as well as another with hell
as well as with the Brahma-life? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are
not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should curse herself or another with hell or with the Brahma-life,
there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><span class="term">Another</span> means:
<span class="gloss">one who is ordained.</span></p>
<p>If she curses with hell or with the Brahma-life, there is an offence of
expiation. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.277" href="#Vin.4.277"></a>

If she thinks that she is ordained when she is ordained (and) curses (her) with
hell or with the Brahma-life, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in
doubt as to whether she is ordained … If she thinks that she is not ordained
when she is ordained … offence of expiation. If she curses (her) with animal
birth or with the realm of the departed or with human misfortune, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If she curses one who is not ordained, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is ordained when she is not
ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether
she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she
is not ordained when she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.19.2.3" href="#Bi-Pc.19.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she is aiming at (explaining) the goal, if she is aiming
at (explaining) a rule, if she is aiming at (explaining) the teaching; if she
is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
