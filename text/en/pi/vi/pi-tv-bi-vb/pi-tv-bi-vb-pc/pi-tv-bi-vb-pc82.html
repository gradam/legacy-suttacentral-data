… At Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
nuns ordained every year; there were not sufficient dwellings. People … spread
it about saying: “How can these nuns ordain every year? There are not
sufficient dwellings.” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who
were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns ordain every
year?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as it is said, monks, that nuns ordain every year?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns ordain every year? It is not, monks, for pleasing those
who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of raining:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should ordain every year, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Every year</span> means:
<span class="gloss">annually.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should ordain</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… and an offence of wrong-doing for the group and for the woman teacher.</span></p>

There is no offence if she ordains in the alternate (years); if she is mad, if
she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
