… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the nun Thullanandā ordained the probationer Caṇḍakalī who kept company with
men, who kept company with youths, who was violent, a dwelling-place of grief.
Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the lady Thullanandā ordain … grief?”</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā ordained … grief?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.334" href="#Vin.4.334"></a>
ordain … grief? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased
… this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should ordain a probationer who keeps company with men, who keeps
company with youths, who is violent, a dwelling-place of grief, there is an
offence of expiation.”</span></p>
