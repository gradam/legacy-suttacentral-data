… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
nuns neither asked (the date of) the Observance day nor did they ask for
exhortation. Monks … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns neither ask
(the date of) the Observance day nor ask for exhortation?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns neither … nor ask for exhortation?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns neither … nor ask for exhortation? It is not, monks, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Every half month a nun should desire two things from the Order of monks: the
asking as to (the date of) the Observance day and the approaching for
exhortation. For her who transgresses this, there is an offence of expiation.</span>”</p>

<span class="term">Every half month</span> means:

<p><span class="term">Observance day</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the two Observance days, that on the fourteenth day and that on the fifteenth
day.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Exhortation</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the eight important rules.</span></p>
<p>If she thinks, “I will neither ask (the date of) the Observance day nor ask for
exhortation,” in throwing off the responsibility, … <span class="add">see <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bi-vb-pc58#Bi-Pc.58.2.1">Bi-Pc.58.2.1</a>–<a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bi-vb-pc58#Bi-Pc.58.2.2">Bi-Pc.58.2.2</a></span> … if she is the first wrong-doer.
