… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
nuns ordained a probationer who had not trained for two years in the six rules.
These were ignorant, inexperienced, they did not know what was allowable or
what was not allowable. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:
“How can these nuns ordain a probationer who has not trained for two years in
the six rules?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns … in the six rules?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can these nuns ordain … in the six rules? <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.319" href="#Vin.4.319"></a>
It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …” and having
rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to give a probationer the agreement as to training for two
years in the six rules. And thus, monks, should it be given: That probationer,
having approached the Order, having arranged her upper robe over one shoulder,
having honoured the feet of the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.365" href="#BD.3.365"></a>
nuns, having sat down on her haunches, having saluted with joined palms, should
speak thus: <span class="kamma">‘Ladies, I, so and so, a probationer, under the lady so and so, request the
Order for the agreement as to training for two years in the six rules.’ And a
second time it should be requested … And a third time it should be requested.</span> The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent nun, saying:
<span class="kamma">‘Ladies, let the Order listen to me. This (woman) so and so, a probationer,
under the lady so and so, requests the Order for the agreement as to training
for two years in the six rules. If it seems right to the Order, let the Order
give the probationer so and so the agreement as to training for two years in
the six rules. This is the motion: Ladies, let the Order listen to me. This
(woman) so and so … requests … for two years in the six rules. If the giving to
the probationer so and so of the agreement as to training for two years in the
six rules is pleasing to the ladies, let them be silent; if it is not pleasing,
they should speak. The agreement as to training for two years in the six rules
is given to the probationer so and so, and it is right … So do I understand
this.’</span>”</p>
<p>That probationer should be told: “Speak thus: <span class="kamma">‘I undertake for two years not to transgress the resolution of abstinence from
onslaught on creatures; I undertake … abstinence from taking what is not given
… abstinence from unchastity … abstinence from lying … abstinence from
occasions for sloth (arising from) fermented liquor and spirits and strong
drink; I undertake for two years not to transgress the resolution of abstinence
from eating at the wrong time.’</span>”</p>
<p>Then the lord, having rebuked these nuns in many a <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.366" href="#BD.3.366"></a>
figure for their weakness in maintaining themselves … “… And thus, monks, let
the nuns set forth this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should ordain a probationer who has not trained for two years in
the six rules, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Two years</span> means:
<span class="gloss">two years. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.320" href="#Vin.4.320"></a>
</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Has not trained</span> means:
<span class="gloss">either the training is not given or the training is given (but) is interrupted.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should ordain</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… <span class="add"><a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bi-vb-pc61#Bi-Pc.61.2.1">Bi-Pc.61.2.1</a></span> … and an offence of wrong-doing for the group and for the woman teacher.</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.63.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.63.2.2"></a>
If she thinks that it is a legally valid act when it is a legally valid act
(and) ordains her, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as to
whether it is a legally valid act … If she thinks that it is not a legally
valid act when it is a legally valid act… offence of expiation. If she thinks
that it is a legally valid act when it is not a legally valid act, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether it is not a legally
valid act … If she thinks that it is not a legally valid act when it is not a
legally valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.63.2.3" href="#Bi-Pc.63.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she ordains a probationer who has trained for two years
in the six rules; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
