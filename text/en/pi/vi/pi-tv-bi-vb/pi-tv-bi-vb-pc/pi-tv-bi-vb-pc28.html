… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the nun Thullanandā gave recluses’ robe-material to players and to dancers and
to female tumblers and to female conjurors and to drummers, saying: “Do praise
me in public.” The players and the dancers and the tumblers and the conjurors
and the drummers praised the nun Thullanandā in public, saying: “The lady
Thullanandā is very learned, she is a repeater, she is wise, she is skilled in
giving talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Give for the lady, make for the lady.” Those who were modest nuns … spread it
about, saying:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.299" href="#BD.3.299"></a>
“How can the lady Thullanandā give recluses’ robe-material to a householder?”
…</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā gave recluses’
robe-material to a householder?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā give recluses’ robe-material to a
householder? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …
this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should give recluses’ robe-material to a householder or to a
wanderer or to a female wanderer, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><span class="term">Wanderer</span> means:

<p><span class="term">Recluses’ robe-material</span> means:

There is no offence if she gives to (her) parents; if she gives for the time
being; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
