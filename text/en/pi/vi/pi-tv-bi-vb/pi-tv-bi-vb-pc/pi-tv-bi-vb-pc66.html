… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
nuns ordained a girl married for full twelve years (but) who had not trained
for two years in the six rules. These were ignorant, inexperienced, they did
not know what was allowable or what was not allowable. Those who were modest
nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns ordain a girl married for
full twelve years (but) who has not trained for two years in the six rules?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks …?” …</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can these nuns
ordain … in the six rules? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not
(yet) pleased …” and having rebuked them, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.323" href="#Vin.4.323"></a>
having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to give a girl married for full twelve years the agreement
as to training for two years in the six rules. And thus, monks, should it be
given: That girl married for full twelve years, having approached the Order … <span class="add"><a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bi-vb-pc63#Bi-Pc.63.1">Bi-Pc.63.1</a></span> … should speak thus:
<span class="kamma">‘Ladies, I, so and so, a girl married for full twelve years, and who am under
the lady so and so, request the Order … <span class="add">
<a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bi-vb-pc63#Bi-Pc.63.1">Bi-Pc.63.1</a>.
<em>Instead of</em> probationer
<em>read</em> a girl married for full twelve years</span> … So do I understand this.’</span> That girl married for full twelve years should be told:
<span class="kamma">‘Speak thus: … <span class="add"><a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bi-vb-pc63#Bi-Pc.63.1">Bi-Pc.63.1</a></span> …’</span> “… this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should ordain a girl married for full twelve years (but) who has
not trained for two years in the six rules, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p>There is no offence if she ordains a girl married for full twelve years and who
has trained for two years in the six rules; if she is mad, if she is the first
wrong-doer.</p>
