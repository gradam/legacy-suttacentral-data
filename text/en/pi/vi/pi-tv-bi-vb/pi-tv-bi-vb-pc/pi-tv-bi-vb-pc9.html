… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a certain brahmin’s cornfield was beside a nunnery. The nuns threw out
excrement and urine and rubbish and remains of food into the field. Then that
brahmin … spread it about, saying: “How can the nuns despoil our cornfield?”
Nuns heard that brahmin who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns …
spread it about, saying: “How can nuns throw out excrement … and the remains of
food on to the crops?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns threw out … on to the crops?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns throw out … on to the crops? It is not, monks, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should throw out or should cause (another) to throw out excrement
or urine or rubbish or the remains of food on to the crops, there is an offence
of expiation.”</span></p>

If she thinks that they are crops when they are crops (and) throws out or
causes (another) to throw out, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in
doubt as to whether they are crops … If she thinks that they are not crops when
they are crops … offence of expiation. If she thinks that they are crops when
they are not crops, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as
to whether they are not crops, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she
thinks that they are not crops when they are not crops, there is no offence.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.9.2.3" href="#Bi-Pc.9.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she throws out having looked round; if she throws out on
to the edges of a field; if she throws out having asked the owner (for
permission) and having obtained the permission; if she is mad, if she is the
first wrong-doer.</p>
