… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six nuns learnt worldly knowledge. People … spread it about,
saying: “How can these nuns learn worldly knowledge, like women householders
who enjoy pleasures of the senses?” Nuns heard these people who … spread it
about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can this
group of six nuns learn worldly knowledge?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six nuns learn worldly
knowledge?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can this group of six nuns learn worldly knowledge? It is not,
monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should learn worldly knowledge, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Worldly knowledge</span> means:
<span class="gloss">whatever is secular, not connected with the goal.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should learn</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if she learns by line, for every line there is an offence of expiation. If she
learns by <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.338" href="#BD.3.338"></a>
syllable, for every syllable there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.49.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.49.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if she learns writing; if she learns what is memorised; if
she learns a spell for protection; if she is mad, if she is the first
wrong-doer.</p>
