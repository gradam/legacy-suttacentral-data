… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a certain nun frequented a certain family as a regular diner. Then that nun,
having dressed in the morning, taking her bowl and robe, approached that
family; having approached, having sat down on a seat, she departed without
asking the owner (for permission). The family’s slave-woman, while sweeping the
house, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.272" href="#Vin.4.272"></a>
placed that seat inside a dish. The people, not seeing that seat, spoke thus to
that nun: “Lady, where is that seat?”</p>
<p>“I, sirs, did not see that seat.”</p>
<p>Saying, “Lady, give back that seat,” having scolded her, they stopped (her as)
a regular diner. Then these people, searching the house, having seen that seat
inside the dish, having apologised to that nun, (re-) established her as a
regular diner. Then that nun told this matter to the nuns. Those who were
modest nuns … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this nun, having approached families before a meal, having sat down on
a seat, depart without asking the owner (for permission)?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that a nun … the owner (for permission)?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can a nun … depart without asking the owner (for permission)? It
is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of
training:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.271" href="#BD.3.271"></a>
“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, having approached families before a meal, having sat down on a
seat, should depart without asking the owner (for permission), there is an
offence of expiation.</span>”</p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Before a meal</span> means:
<span class="gloss">from sunrise until midday.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Family</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there are four (kinds of) families: a noble family, a brahmin family, a
merchant family, a low-caste family.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Having approached</span> means:
<span class="gloss">having gone there.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">A seat</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is called a place for sitting cross-legged.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Having sat down</span> means:
<span class="gloss">having sat down on this.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should depart without asking the owner (for permission)</span> means:
<span class="gloss">whatever man in that family is learned, without asking him (for permission but)
in letting herself pass a place that is sheltered from the rain, there is an
offence of expiation.</span></p>

If she thinks that she has not asked (for permission) when she has not asked
(for permission) and departs, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.272" href="#BD.3.272"></a>
there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as to whether she has not
asked (for permission) … If she thinks that she has asked (for permission) when
she has not asked (for permission) … there is an offence of expiation. If it is
not for a place for sitting cross-legged, there is an offence of wrong-doing.
If she thinks that she has not asked (for permission) when she has asked (for
permission), there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to
whether she has asked (for permission), there is an offence of wrong-doing. If
she thinks that she has asked (for permission) when she has asked (for
permission), there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.15.2.3" href="#Bi-Pc.15.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she goes away asking (for permission); if it is one that
is not movable; if she is ill; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is
the first wrong-doer. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.273" href="#Vin.4.273"></a></p>
