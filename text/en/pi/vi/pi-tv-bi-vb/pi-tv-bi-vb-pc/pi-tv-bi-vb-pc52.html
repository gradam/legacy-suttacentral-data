… at Vesālī in the Great Grove at the Hall of the Gabled Pillars. Now at that
time the venerable Kappitaka, the venerable Upāli’s preceptor, lived in a
cemetery. Now at that time an older nun of the group of six nuns had passed
away. The group of six nuns, taking out that nun, having cremated her not far
from the venerable Kappitaka’s dwelling place, having made a tomb, having gone
(there), wept at that tomb. Then the venerable Kappitaka, troubled by that
noise, having destroyed that tomb, scattered (the materials). The group of six
nuns took counsel, saying: “Our lady’s tomb is destroyed by this Kappitaka,
come, let us kill him.” A certain nun told this matter to the venerable Upāli.
The venerable Upāli told this matter to the venerable Kappitaka. Then the
venerable Kappitaka, having gone out from that dwelling place, lay in hiding.
Then the group of six nuns approached the venerable Kappitaka’s dwelling place,
having approached, having had the venerable Kappitaka’s dwelling place covered
over with stones and clods of earth, they departed, saying, “Kappitaka is
dead.” Then the venerable Kappitaka at the end of that night having dressed in
the morning, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for almsfood. The group
of six nuns saw the venerable Kappitaka walking for almsfood; seeing him, they
spoke thus: “This Kappitaka is alive, how ever did he foil our plan?” The group
of six nuns <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.344" href="#BD.3.344"></a>
heard it said: “Our plan was foiled by master Upāli.” These reviled the
venerable Upāli, saying: “How can this barber, a shampooing low-birth (person),
foil our plan?” Those who were modest nuns … <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.309" href="#Vin.4.309"></a>
spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six nuns revile master Upāli?”
…</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six nuns reviled Upāli?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the group of six nuns revile Upāli? It is not, monks, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should revile or should abuse a monk, there is an offence of
expiation.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bi-Pc.52.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.52.2.1" href="#Bi-Pc.52.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Monk</span> means:
<span class="gloss">one who is ordained.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should revile</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if she reviles with the ten ways of reviling or with any one of these, there is
an offence of expiation.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Or should abuse</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if she makes him afraid, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.52.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.52.2.2"></a>
If she thinks that he is ordained when he is ordained (and) reviles or abuses
him, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as to whether he is
ordained … If she thinks that he is not ordained when he is ordained … offence
of expiation. If she reviles or abuses one who is not ordained, there is an
offence of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.345" href="#BD.3.345"></a>
wrong-doing. If she thinks that he is ordained when he is not ordained … If she
is in doubt as to whether he is not ordained … If she thinks that he is not
ordained when he is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.52.2.3" href="#Bi-Pc.52.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she is aiming at (explaining) the goal, if she is aiming
at (explaining) a rule, if she is aiming at (explaining) the teaching; if she
is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
