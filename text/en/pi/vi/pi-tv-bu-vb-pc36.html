… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
two monks were travelling to Sāvatthī along a high-road in the Kosalan
districts. One monk indulged in bad habits; the second monk said to this monk:
“Your reverence, do not do that, it is not allowable.” He grumbled at him. Then
these monks arrived at Sāvatthī. Now at that time food for the Order was
(prepared) by a certain guild in Sāvatthī. The second monk, having eaten, came
to be satisfied. The monk who grumbled, having gone to his relations, taking
alms-food, approached that monk, and having approached he said to that monk:</p>
<p>“Do eat, your reverence.”</p>
<p>“No need, I am full, your reverence.”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, the alms-food is delicious, do eat.”</p>
<p>Then this monk, being pressed by that monk, ate that alms-food. The monk who
grumbled <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.84" href="#Vin.4.84"></a>
said to that monk:</p>
<p>Your reverence, you think that I should be advised (by you), when you, having
eaten, being satisfied, eat soft food that is not left over?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, should it not be spoken about?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, should it not be inquired into?”</p>
<p>Then that monk told this matter to the monks. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can a monk, asking a monk who has eaten, who is satisfied, invite him (to
take) soft food that is not left over?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.333" href="#BD.2.333"></a>
“Is it true, as is said, that you, monk, asking a monk … soft food that is not
left over?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, asking a monk who has eaten, who is satisfied,
invite him (to take) soft food that is not left over? It is not, foolish man,
for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of
training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, asking a monk who has eaten, who is satisfied, should invite him
(to take) solid food or soft food that is not left over, saying: ‘Now, monk,
eat or partake of,’ knowing, desiring to find fault with, in the eating there
is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

will partake <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.334" href="#BD.2.334"></a>

If he thinks that he was satisfied when he was satisfied (and), asking him,
invites him (to take) solid food or soft food that is not left over, there is
an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether he was satisfied …
offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that he was not satisfied when he was
satisfied … is no offence. If he asks him (to take) for the sake of nourishment
(food to be eaten) during a watch of the night, during seven days, during life,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If, at his bidding, he accepts, saying: ‘I
will eat, I will partake of,’ there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every
mouthful there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that he was satisfied
when he was not satisfied, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.85" href="#Vin.4.85"></a>
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether he was not

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.36.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.36.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if, having caused it to be made left over, he gives it; if,
having caused it to be made left over, he gives it, saying, “Eat”; if he gives
it, saying: “Go away, conveying it for the sake of another”; if he gives the
remainder of an ill (monk’s meal); if, when there is a reason, he gives (food
to be eaten) during a watch of the night, during seven days, during life,
saying, “Make use of it”; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
