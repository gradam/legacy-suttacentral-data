… at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding place. At that time
the monks of Āḷavī, begging in company, were having huts built with no
benefactor, for their own advantage, and not according to measure; but these
were not finished. They lived intent on begging, intent on hinting: “Give a
man, give a servant, give an ox, give a wagon, give a knife, give a hatchet,
give an axe, give a spade, give a chisel, give a creeper, give bamboo, give
muñja-grass, give coarse grass, give <i lang="pi">tiṇa</i>-grass, give clay.” People were oppressed with the begging, oppressed with the
hinting, and when they saw the monks they were perturbed, then alarmed, then
they ran away, then they went by a different route, turned in another direction
and closed the door; and when they saw cows they ran away, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.145" href="#Vin.3.145"></a>
imagining them to be monks.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.247" href="#BD.1.247"></a>
Then the venerable Kassapa the Great arose from spending the rains in Rājagaha,
and set out for Āḷavī. In due course he arrived at Āḷavī. There the venerable
Kassapa the Great stayed in the chief shrine at Āḷavī. Then the venerable
Kassapa the Great rising early, and taking his bowl and robes, entered Āḷavī
for alms. People seeing the venerable Kassapa the Great were perturbed, then
alarmed, then they ran away, then they went by a different route, turned in
another direction and closed the door. Then the venerable Kassapa the Great,
having walked Āḷavī for alms, after having eaten and finished his meal,
addressed the monks saying:</p>
<p>“Formerly, your reverences, Āḷavī had good alms-food, alms were easily
obtained, it was easy to keep oneself going by gleaning or by favour. But now
this Āḷavī is short of alms-food, alms are difficult to obtain, nor is it easy
to keep oneself going by gleaning or by favour. What is the reason, what the
cause that now this Āḷavī is short of alms-food, that alms are difficult to
obtain, that it is not easy to keep oneself going by gleaning or by favour?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.248" href="#BD.1.248"></a>
Then these monks told this matter to the venerable Kassapa the Great.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.6.1.2" href="#Bu-Ss.6.1.2"></a>
Then the lord having dwelt at Rājagaha for as long as he thought fit, set out
on a tour for Āḷavī. Making the tour, in due course he arrived at Āḷavī. There
at Āḷavī the lord dwelt in the chief shrine at Āḷavī. Then the venerable
Kassapa the Great approached the lord, and having approached him, he greeted
the lord and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side the venerable Kassapa
the Great told this matter to the lord. Then the lord on that occasion, for
that reason, having had the Order of monks convened, questioned the monks of
Āḷavī, saying:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, begging in company, were having huts
built, with no benefactor, for your own advantage, not according to measure,
and that these were not completed? They say that you dwelt intent on begging,
intent on hinting: ‘Give a man …’… seeing cows they ran away, taking them for
monks.”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How can you, foolish men,
begging in company, have huts built? … ‘Give a man … give clay.’ It is not
foolish men, for the benefit of unbelievers,” … having rebuked them and given <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk, he addressed the monks:</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.6.1.3" href="#Bu-Ss.6.1.3"></a>
“Formerly, monks, two brothers (who were) holy men lived close by the river
Ganges. Then, monks, Maṇikaṇṭha, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.146" href="#Vin.3.146"></a>
the <i lang="pi">nāga</i>-king, emerging from the
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.249" href="#BD.1.249"></a>
river Ganges, came up to the younger holy man, and having come up and encircled
the younger holy man seven times with his coils, he stood spreading his great
hood above his head. Then, monks, the younger holy man, through fear of this
snake, became thin, wretched, of a bad colour, yellowish, his veins showing all
over his body. Monks, the elder holy man saw that the younger holy man was
thin, wretched, of bad colour, yellowish, the veins showing all over his body.
Seeing this, he said to the younger holy man: ‘Why are you, good sir, thin …
all over your body?’</p>
<p>“‘Now, the <i lang="pi">nāga</i>-king, Maṇikaṇṭha, came out of the river Ganges for me, and came up to me, and
having come up and having encircled me seven times with his coils, he stood
spreading his great hood above my head. I, good sir, through fear of the snake,
became thin … all over my body.’</p>
<p>“‘But, good sir, do you not want this snake to return?’</p>
<p>“‘Good sir, I do not want this snake to return.’</p>
<p>“‘Do you, good sir, see anything of this snake?’</p>
<p>“‘I see, good sir, the jewelled ornament on his throat.’</p>
<p>“‘Then, good sir, you beg this snake for the jewel, saying: “Good sir, give me
the jewel; I want the jewel.”’</p>
<p>“Then, monks, Maṇikaṇṭha, the <i lang="pi">nāga</i>-king, emerging from the river Ganges, came up to the younger holy man and
having come up he stood to one side. Monks, as he was standing to one side, the
younger holy man said to Maṇikaṇṭha, the <i lang="pi">nāga</i>-king: ‘Good sir, give the jewel to me, I want the jewel.’ Then Maṇikaṇṭha, the
<i lang="pi">nāga</i>-king, said: ‘A monk begs for the jewel, a monk wants the jewel,’ and he
hurried away.</p>
<p>“A second time, monks, did Maṇikaṇṭha emerging … come up to the younger holy
man. Then, monks, the younger holy man saw Maṇikaṇṭha, the <i lang="pi">nāga</i>-king, coming from afar, and seeing Maṇikaṇṭha, the <i lang="pi">nāga</i>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.250" href="#BD.1.250"></a>
king, he said: ‘Good sir, give me the jewel, I want the jewel.’ Then, monks,
Maṇikaṇṭha, the <i lang="pi">nāga</i>-king, said: ‘A monk begs for the jewel, a monk wants the jewel.’ And then he
turned away again.</p>
<p>“A third time, monks, Maṇikaṇṭha, the
<i lang="pi">nāga</i>-king, came up from the river Ganges. Then, monks, the younger holy man saw
Maṇikaṇṭha, the <i lang="pi">nāga</i>-king, emerging from the river Ganges, and seeing him, he said to Maṇikaṇṭha,
the <i lang="pi">nāga</i>-king: ‘Good sir, give me the jewel, I want the jewel.’ Then, monks,
Maṇikaṇṭha, the <i lang="pi">nāga</i>-king, addressed these verses to the younger holy man:
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.147" href="#Vin.3.147"></a></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“‘My food and drink is produced abundantly,<br>
Excellently, by reason of this jewel,<br>
I do not give it to you, you are one who asks too much,<br>
And not for you will I come to a hermitage.</p>
<p>“Like a lad, his hand on a tempered sword,<br>
You frighten (me) begging for this stone,<br>
I do not give it to you, you are one who asks too much<br>
And not for you will I come to a hermitage.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Then, monks, Maṇikaṇṭha, the
<i lang="pi">nāga</i>-king, said: ‘A monk begs for the jewel, a monk wants the jewel,’ and he went
away; then he was gone, and did not come back <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.251" href="#BD.1.251"></a>
again. Then, monks, the younger holy man, not seeing that beautiful snake,
became increasingly thin, wretched, of a bad colour, yellowish, the veins
showing all over his body. The elder holy man, seeing that the younger holy man
had become increasingly thin … the veins showing all over his body, said to the
younger holy man:</p>
<p>“‘Why are you, good sir, increasingly thin … the veins showing all over your
body?’</p>
<p>“‘It is because I, good sir, do not see the beautiful snake that I become
increasingly thin … the veins showing all over my body.’</p>
<p>“Then, monks, the elder holy man addressed these verses to the younger holy
man:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“‘Do not beg him who is dear for what you covet,<br>
It is odious to ask for too much,<br>
The snake, begged by a brahmin for a jewel,<br>
Disappeared, and was not seen (again).’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Monks, begging from these animals and living creatures will become hated,
begging by hinting (will become) hated, how much more then (will be begging)
from men?</p>

“Once upon a time, monks, a certain monk lived in a certain thicket on a slope
of the Himālayas. Monks, not far from the thicket was an extensive, low-lying
marshy ground. Then, monks, a great flock of birds, going daily to feed in this
marshy ground, entered the thicket at night to roost. Then, monks, that monk,
worried by the noise of the flocking birds, came up to me, and having come up
and greeted me, he sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, I said, monks, to
that monk: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.148" href="#Vin.3.148"></a>
‘I hope, monk, you are getting on well, I hope, monk, you are keeping going,
having accomplished your journey with but little fatigue. But where do you come
from, monk?’</p>
<p>“‘I am getting along fairly well, lord, I am keeping going, lord, and, lord,
have accomplished my journey <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.252" href="#BD.1.252"></a>
with but little fatigue. There is, lord, on the slopes of the Himālayas a large
thicket, and, lord, not far from this thicket there is an extensive, low-lying
marshy ground. Now, lord, a great flock of birds going daily to feed at that
marshy ground goes into that thicket at night to roost. That is why I come,
lord, for I am worried by the noise of that flock of birds.’</p>
<p>“I said: ‘Monk, do you want this flock of birds not to return?’</p>
<p>“‘I want, lord, this flock of birds not to return.’</p>
<p>“I said: ‘Then you, monk, going there, and penetrating this thicket three times
in the first watch of the night must utter this sound: ‘Listen to me, good
sirs, whatever birds have come to roost in this thicket, I want a feather. Good
sirs, give me one feather ‘at a time.’ Three times in the middle watch … three
times in the last watch … at a time.’ Then, monks, this monk having gone there,
and having penetrated the thicket, uttered this sound three times … in the
middle watch of the night … in the last watch of the night … ‘at a time.’ Then,
monks, that flock of birds said: ‘The monk begs for a feather, the monk wants a
feather,’ and they departed from that thicket, and after they were gone, they
did not come back again. Begging, monks, from these animals and living
creatures will become hateful, hinting (will become) hateful, how much more
then from men?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.6.1.5" href="#Bu-Ss.6.1.5"></a>
“Once upon a time, monks, the father of Raṭṭhapāla, the noble youth, addressed
these verses to Raṭṭhapāla, the noble youth:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“‘Tho’ I do not know them, Raṭṭhāpāla, the many-folk,<br>
These, meeting me, beg—why do you not beg of me?’</p>
<p>‘The beggar is not liked, the not-giver to beggar is not liked,<br>
Therefore I do not beg of you, do not be angry with me.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.253" href="#BD.1.253"></a>
“Monks, if Raṭṭhapāla, the noble youth, can speak thus to his own father, how
much more then ean (any) person to (any other) person?</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.6.1.6" href="#Bu-Ss.6.1.6"></a>
“Monks, it is difficult for householders to collect possessions
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.149" href="#Vin.3.149"></a>
, and difficult to protect their stores; how can you, foolish men, dwell intent
on begging, intent on asking by hinting (for something) from among these
possessions which are difficult to collect, and from among these stores which
are difficult to protect, saying: ‘Give a man, give a servant, give an ox, give
a wagon, give a knife, give a hatchet, give an axe, give a spade, give a
chisel, give a creeper, give bamboo, give <i lang="pi">muñja</i>-grass, give coarse grass, give <i lang="pi">tiṇa</i>-grass, give clay.’ This is not, foolish men, for the benefit of unbelievers …
and, monks, thus this course of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">A monk begging in company for having a hut built, which has no benefactor, for
his own advantage, should make it according to measure. This is the measure: in
length, twelve spans of a span of the accepted length; in width seven spans
inside. Monks should be brought for marking out the site. A site not involving
destruction, and with an open space round it, should be marked out by these
monks. If that monk should build a hut, begging himself for a site which
involves destruction and which has not an open space round it, or if he should
not bring the monks for marking out a site, or if he should exceed the measure,
there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.</span>”</p>

<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.6.2.2" href="#Bu-Ss.6.2.2"></a>
<span class="term">Monks should be brought for marking out a site</span> means:
<span class="gloss">that a monk building a hut, having cleared a site for a hut, approaching the
Order, arranging his robe over one shoulder, honouring the feet of the senior
monks, squatting down on his heels, and saluting with his palms outstretched,
should speak thus to them: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, I, begging in company, for my own advantage, am desirous of
building a hut, it has no benefactor; honoured sirs, I beg the Order for
inspection of the site for a hut.’</span> A second time it should be begged for, a third time
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.150" href="#Vin.3.150"></a>
it should be begged for. If the whole Order is able to inspect a site for a
hut, it should be inspected by the whole Order. But if the whole Order is not
able to inspect a site for a hut, then those monks who are experienced and
competent to know what involves destruction, what does not involve destruction,
what has an open space round it, what does not have <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.255" href="#BD.1.255"></a>
an open space round it—begging these, they should depute (them).</span></p>
<p>And thus, monks, should they depute (them): the Order should be informed by an
experienced, competent monk: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. Such and such a monk, begging in
company, for his own advantage, desirous of building a hut which has no
benefactor, begs the Order for inspection of the site for a hut. If it is the
right time for the Order, the Order should depute such and such monks to
inspect a site for a hut for that monk. This is the motion. Let the Order
listen to me, honoured sirs. Such and such a monk … site for a hut. The Order
deputes such and such monks to inspect a site for a hut for such and such a
monk. If it seems good to the venerable ones to depute the inspection of a site
for a hut to such and such monks for that monk, be silent; if it does not seem
good, then you should speak. Such and such monks are deputed by the Order to
inspect a site for a hut for such and such a monk. It seems good to the Order,
therefore they are silent; thus do I understand.’</span></p>
<p>These monks (thus) deputed, going there, a site for a hut should be inspected,
it should be known whether it involves destruction, whether it does not involve
destruction, whether it has an open space round it, whether it does not have an
open space round it. If it involves destruction and has not an open space round
it, it should be said: Do not build here. If it does not involve destruction
and has an open space round it, the Order should be told that it does not
involve destruction and that it has an open space round it. The monk building
the hut, going up to the Order, arranging his robe over one shoulder, honouring
the feet of the senior monks, squatting down on his heels, and saluting with
his palms outstretched, should speak thus: <span class="kamma">‘I, honoured sirs, begging in company, am desirous of building a hut; it has no
benefactor, it is for my own advantage. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.256" href="#BD.1.256"></a>

The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. Such and such a monk, begging in
company, is desirous of building a hut, it has no benefactor, it is for his own

Such and such a monk … site for a hut. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.151" href="#Vin.3.151"></a>
The Order marks out a site for a hut for such and such a monk. If the marking
out of the site for a hut for such and such a monk seems good to the venerable
