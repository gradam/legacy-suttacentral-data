… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the nun Thullanandā ordained a probationer without the consent of the parents
and husband. The parents and the husband … spread it about, saying : “How can
the lady Thullanandā ordain the probationer without our consent?” Nuns heard
the parents and the husband who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns …
spread it about, saying : “How can the lady Thullanandā ordain a probationer
without the consent of the parents and husband?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā ordained … and
husband?” “It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can the nun
Thullanandā ordain a probationer … and husband? It is not, monks, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.335" href="#Vin.4.335"></a>
