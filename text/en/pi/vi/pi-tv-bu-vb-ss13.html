… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Now at that time,
unscrupulous, depraved monks who were the followers of Assaji and Punabbasu
were in residence at Kiṭāgiri. They indulged in the following kinds of bad
habits: they planted and caused to be planted small flowering trees; they
watered them <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.180" href="#Vin.3.180"></a>
and caused them to be watered; they plucked them and caused them to be plucked;
they tied them up into (garlands) and caused them to be tied up; they made and
caused to be made garlands having a stalk on one side; they made and caused to
be made garlands having a stalk on both sides; they made and caused to be made
a branching flower-stalk; they made and caused to be <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.315" href="#BD.1.315"></a>
made a wreath; they made and caused to be made a garland worn round the
forehead; they made and caused to be made an ear-ornament; they made and caused
to be made a breast-plate. These (monks) take or send garlands having a stalk
on one side to wives of reputable families, to daughters of reputable families,
to girls of reputable families, to daughters-in-law of reputable families, to
female slaves of reputable families. They take or send garlands having a stalk
on both sides; they take or send a branching flower-stalk; they take or send a
wreath; they take or send a garland worn round the forehead; they take or send
an ear-ornament; they take or send a breast-plate. These eat from one dish
together with wives of reputable families, with daughters of reputable
families, with girls of reputable families, with daughters-in-law of reputable
families, with female slaves of reputable families. They drink from one beaker;
they sit down on one seat; they share one couch; they share one mat; they share
one coverlet; they share one mat and coverlet. They eat at the wrong time; they
drink intoxicants; they wear garlands, (use) perfumes and cosmetics; they dance
and sing and play musical instruments, and they sport. They dance when she
dances, they sing when she dances, they play musical instruments when she
dances, they sport when she dances; they dance when she sings … they dance when
she plays musical instruments … they dance when she sports … they sport when
she sports.</p>

They play on a chequered board for gambling; they play on a draught-board; they
play with imagining such boards in the air; they play a game of keeping
stepping on to diagrams; they play with spillikans; they play at dice; they
play tip-cat; they play brush-hand; they play with a ball; they play at blowing
through toy-pipes made of leaves; they play with a toy plough; they play at
turning somersaults; they play with a toy windmill; they play with a toy

game of guessing at letters; they play a mind-reading game; they play a game of
mimicking deformities; they train themselves in elephant lore; they train
themselves in horse lore; they train themselves in cart lore; they train
themselves in archery; they train themselves in swordsmanship; then they run in
front of an elephant, they run in front of a horse and they run in front of a
chariot; now they run backwards, now they run forwards, and they whistle, and
they snap their fingers, and they wrestle, and they fight with fists, and
having spread out their upper robes as <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.318" href="#BD.1.318"></a>
a stage, they say to a dancing girl: “Dance here, sister,” and they applaud,
and indulge in various bad habits.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.13.1.3" href="#Bu-Ss.13.1.3"></a>
At one time a certain monk, rising up from spending the rains among the people
of Kāsī, and going to Sāvatthī for the sake of seeing the lord, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.181" href="#Vin.3.181"></a>
arrived at Kiṭāgiri. Then this monk getting up early and taking his bowl and
robe entered Kiṭāgiri for alms-food. He was pleasing whether he was approaching
or departing, whether he was looking before or looking behind, whether he was
drawing in or stretching out (his arm), his eyes were cast down, he was
possessed of pleasant behaviour.</p>
<p>People seeing this monk, spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Who can this be like an idiot of idiots, like a fool of fools, like a very
supercilious person? Who will go up to him and give him alms? Our masters, the
followers of Assaji and Punabbasu are polite, genial, pleasant of speech,
beaming with smiles, saying: ‘Come, you are welcome.’ They are not
supercilious, they are easily accessible, they are the first to speak.
Therefore alms should be given to these.”</p>
<p>A certain lay follower saw that monk wandering in Kiṭāgiri for alms; seeing
that monk he approached him, and having approached and greeted him, he said:</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, are alms obtainable?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.319" href="#BD.1.319"></a>
“Alms are not obtainable, your reverence,” he said.</p>
<p>“Come, honoured sir, we will go to my house.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.13.1.4" href="#Bu-Ss.13.1.4"></a>
Then the lay follower having taken this monk to his house and made him eat,
said:</p>
<p>“Where, honoured sir, will the master go?”</p>
<p>“I will go to Sāvatthī, your reverence, to see the lord,” he said.</p>
<p>“Then, honoured sir, in my name salute the lord’s feet with your head and say:
‘Lord, the residence at Kiṭāgiri has been corrupted. At Kiṭāgiri are residing
unscrupulous, depraved monks who are the followers of Assaji and Punabbasu.
These indulge in the following bad habits … they indulge in a variety of bad
habits. Lord, those men who formerly had faith and were virtuous now have no
faith and are not virtuous. Those who formerly were chaṇṇels for gifts to the
Order are now cut off; they neglect the well-behaved monks, and the depraved
monks stay on. It were good, lord, if the lord would send monks to Kiṭāgiri, so
that this residence in Kiṭāgiri may be settled.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.13.1.5" href="#Bu-Ss.13.1.5"></a>
“Very well, your reverence,” and that monk having answered and rising up from
his seat, departed for Sāvatthī. In due course he approached Sāvatthī, the Jeta
Grove and Anāthapindika’s park and the lord; and having approached and greeted
the lord, he sat down to one side. It is usual for enlightened ones, for lords,
to exchange greetings with in-coming monks. So the lord said to this monk:</p>
<p>“I hope, monk, that it is going well with you, I hope that you are keeping
going, I hope that you have accomplished your journey with but little fatigue.
And where do you come from, monk?”</p>
<p>“Things go well, lord, I am keeping going, lord, and I, lord,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.182" href="#Vin.3.182"></a>
accomplished my journey with but little
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.320" href="#BD.1.320"></a>
fatigue. Now, I, lord, having spent the rains among the people of Kāsī, and
coming to Sāvatthī for the sake of seeing the lord, arrived at Kitāgiri. Then
I, lord, rising up early, and taking my bowl and robe, entered Kitāgiri for
alms-food. Then, lord, a certain lay follower saw me as I was wandering in
Kitāgiri for alms-food, and seeing me he approached, and having approached and
greeted me, he said: ‘Are alms obtainable, honoured sir?’ ‘No, your reverence,
alms are not obtainable,’ I said. ‘Come, honoured sir, we will go to my house,’
he said. Then, lord, that lay follower, taking me to his house and feeding me,
said: ‘Where, honoured sir, will the master go?’ I said: ‘Your reverence, I
will go to Sāvatthī for the sake of seeing the lord.’ Then he said … ‘may be
settled.’ Therefore, lord, do I come.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.13.1.6" href="#Bu-Ss.13.1.6"></a>
Then the lord, on that occasion, in that connection, having had the Order of
monks convened, asked the monks:</p>
<p>“Monks, is it true as is said, that the monks who are followers of Assaji and
Punabbasu, residing in Kitāgiri, are unscrupulous and depraved and indulge in
the following bad habits: they plant small flowering trees … indulge in a
variety of bad habits … and those men, monks … and the depraved monks stay
on?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can these foolish men indulge in this kind of bad habit, how can
they plant small flowering trees or cause them to be planted? How can they
water them or cause them to be watered? How can they pluck them or cause them
to be plucked? How can they tie up garlands or cause them to be tied up? How
can they make or cause to be made … How can they take or send … How can they
eat … How can they drink … sit … stand … eat … drink … run … dance and sing and
play musical <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.321" href="#BD.1.321"></a>
instruments and sport … play … train themselves … run … run round facing … how
can they whistle and snap their fingers and wrestle and fight with fists, and
having spread out their upper robes as a stage, say to a nautch girl: ‘Dance
here, sister,’ and applaud and indulge in a variety of bad habits? It is not,
monks, for the benefit of unbelievers …” and having rebuked them and given them
talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, he addressed Sāriputta and Moggallāna:</p>
<p>“You go, Sāriputta and Moggallāna; and having gone to Kitāgiri make an act of
banishment from Kiṭāgiri against those monks who are followers of Assaji and
Punabbasu; these are fellow monks of yours.”</p>
<p>They said: “Lord, how can we <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.183" href="#Vin.3.183"></a>
make an act of banishment from Kitāgiri against the monks who are followers of
Assaji and Punabbasu? These monks are violent and rough.”</p>
<p>“Then, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, go together with many monks.”</p>
<p>“Very well, lord,” Sāriputta and Moggallāna answered the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.13.1.7" href="#Bu-Ss.13.1.7"></a>
“And this, monks, is how it should be done. First, the monks who are the
followers of Assaji and Punabbasu should be reproved; having been reproved they
should be reminded; having been reminded they should be accused of the offence;
having been accused of the offence, the Order should be informed through an
experienced, competent monk: <span class="kamma">‘Let the Order listen to me, honoured sirs. These monks who are followers of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.322" href="#BD.1.322"></a>
Assaji and Punabbasu are those who bring a family into disrepute, they are of
evil conduct; their evil conduct is seen and also heard, and respectable
families corrupted by them are seen and also heard. If it seems the right time
for the Order, let the Order make an act of banishment from Kiṭāgiri against
the monks who are the followers of Assaji and Punabbasu, so that the monks who
are the followers of Assaji and Punabbasu may not be in Kiṭāgiri. This is the
motion. Let the Order listen to me, honoured sirs. These monks who are … seen
and also heard. The Order issues an act of banishment from Kiṭāgiri against the
monks who are followers of Assaji and Punabbasu so that the monks who are
followers of Assaji and Punabbasu may not be in Kiṭāgiri. If it seems good to
the venerable ones to make an act of banishment from Kiṭāgiri against the monks
who are followers of Assaji and Punabbasu so that the monks who are the
followers of Assaji and Punabbasu may not be in Kiṭāgiri, then be silent; if it
does not seem good (to you) then you should speak. A second time I speak forth
this matter … And a third time do I speak forth this matter: Let the Order
listen to me … should speak. By the Order there has been made an act of
banishment from Kiṭāgiri against the monks who are followers of Assaji and
Punabbasu so that the monks who are followers of Assaji and Punabbasu may not
be in Kiṭāgiri. If it seems good to the Order, then be silent; so do I
understand.’</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.13.1.8" href="#Bu-Ss.13.1.8"></a>
Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna, at the head of a company of monks, having gone
to Kiṭāgiri made an act of banishment from Kiṭāgiri against the monks who were
followers of Assaji and Punabbasu, so that the monks who were followers of
Assaji and Punabbasu might not be in Kiṭāgiri. The act of banishment having
been made by the Order, these did not conduct them <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.323" href="#BD.1.323"></a>
selves properly, nor did they become subdued, nor did they mend their ways,
they did not ask the monks for forgiveness, they cursed them, they reviled
them, they offended by following a wrong course through desire, by following a
wrong course through hatred, by following a wrong course through stupidity, by
following a wrong course through fear; and they went away, and they left the
Order.</p>
<p>Those who were modest monks became angry … and annoyed, and said: “How can the
monks who are followers of Assaji and Punabbasu, banished by the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.324" href="#BD.1.324"></a>
Order, not conduct themselves properly, not become subdued, not mend their
ways? <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.184" href="#Vin.3.184"></a>
Why do they not ask for forgiveness from the monks? Why do they curse and
revile them? Why do they, following a wrong course through desire, hatred,
stupidity and fear, go away and leave the Order?” Then these monks told this
matter to the lord.</p>
<p>He asked: “Is it true as is said, monks, that the monks who are the followers
of Assaji and Punabbasu, having been banished by the Order, do not conduct
themselves properly … leave the Order?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying …“And thus, monks, this
course of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>If a monk lives depending on a certain village or little town, and is one who
brings a family into disrepute and is of depraved conduct, and if his evil
conduct is seen and heard, and families corrupted by him are seen and also
heard, let that monk be spoken to thus by the monks: <span class="kamma">‘The venerable one is one who brings families into disrepute, and is of
depraved conduct. The venerable one’s depraved doings are seen and heard, and
families corrupted by the venerable one are seen and also heard. Let the
venerable one depart from this residence; you have lived here long enough.’</span> And if this monk having been spoken to thus by the monks should say to these
monks: ‘The monks are followers of desire and the monks are followers of hatred
and the monks are followers of stupidity and the monks are followers of fear;
they banish some for such an offence, they do not banish others’—this monk
should be spoken to thus by the monks: <span class="kamma">‘Venerable one, do not speak thus. The monks are not followers of desire and
the monks are not followers of hatred and the monks are not followers of
stupidity and the monks are not followers <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.325" href="#BD.1.325"></a>
of fear. The venerable one is one who brings families into disrepute and is of
depraved conduct. The depraved doings of the venerable one are seen and heard,
and families corrupted by the venerable one are seen and also heard. Let the
venerable one depart from this residence; the venerable one has dwelt in this
residence long enough.’</span> If this monk, when spoken to thus by the monks, should persist as before, that
monk should be admonished up to three times by the monks for giving up his
course. If after being admonished up to three times, he gives up that course,
it is good. If he does not give it up, it is an offence entailing a formal
meeting of the Order.”</p>

offence of wrong-doing. If, having heard, they do not speak, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. That monk having been drawn into the middle of the
Order, should be told: <span class="kamma">‘Do not, venerable one, speak thus … you have lived here long enough.’ A second
time he should be told … A third time he should be told …</span> if he gives up his course it is good, but if he does not give it up there is

courses by following desire, by following hatred, by following confusion, by

to the Order, let the Order admonish this monk for the sake of giving up his

<p>According to the motion there is an offence of wrong-doing … grave offences
subside.</p>
<p><span class="term">An offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order</span> means:

<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.186" href="#Vin.3.186"></a>
one man, therefore it is called an offence which in the earlier as well as in
the later stages requires a formal meeting of the Order. A synonym for this
class of offence is a work; therefore, again, it is called an offence which in
the earlier as well as in the later stages entails a formal meeting of the
Order.</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.13.3.1" href="#Bu-Ss.13.3.1"></a>
Thinking a legally valid act to be a legally valid act, he does not give it
up—there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order. Being in doubt
as to whether it is a legally valid act … Not thinking an act which is legally
valid to be an act which is not legally valid, is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.13.3.2" href="#Bu-Ss.13.3.2"></a>
It is not an offence if he is not admonished, if he gives it up, if he is mad,
if he is a beginner.</p>
<hr>
<p class="end">Told is the Thirteenth Offence entailing a Formal meeting of the Order: that of
bringing families into disrepute</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.328" href="#BD.1.328"></a>
The thirteen matters which require a formal meeting of the Order have been set
down, venerable ones—nine which become offences at once, and four which are not
completed until the third admonition.</p>
<p>If a monk offends against one or other of these, for as many days as he
knowingly conceals his offence, for so many days should probation be spent by
this monk, even against his will. When this monk has spent his probation, a
further six days are to be allowed for the monk’s <i lang="pi">mānatta</i> discipline. If, when the monk has performed the <i lang="pi">mānatta</i> discipline, the company of monks numbers twenty, that monk may be
rehabilitated. But if the Order of monks should rehabilitate that monk when
numbering less than twenty even by one, that monk is not rehabilitated and
these monks are blameworthy. This is the proper course there. Now I ask the
venerable ones: I hope that you are pure in this matter? A second time I ask: I
hope that you are pure in this matter? A third time I ask: I hope that you are
pure in this matter? The venerable ones are pure in this matter, therefore they
are silent. Thus do I understand.</p>
