… among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks, approaching the nuns’ quarters, exhorted the group of
six nuns. Nuns spoke thus to the group of six nuns: “Come, ladies, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.56" href="#Vin.4.56"></a>
we will go for exhortation.”</p>
<p>“Well, ladies, we would go for the sake of exhortation, (but) the group of the
six masters exhort us in this very place.”</p>
<p>Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the group of the six monks, approaching nuns’ quarters, exhort nuns?”</p>
<p>Then these nuns told this matter to the monks. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the group of six monks … exhort nuns?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks … exhorted nuns?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men … exhort nuns? Foolish men, it is not for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should
be set forth:</p>
<p>“Whatever monk, approaching nuns’ quarters, should exhort nuns, there is an
offence of expiation.”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>

Now at that time Mahāpajāpatī the Gotamid became ill. Monks who were elders
approached Mahāpajāpatī the Gotamid, and having approached they spoke thus to
Mahāpajāpatī the Gotamid:</p>
<p>“Gotami, we hope things are going well with you, we hope you are keeping
going.”</p>
<p>“Masters, things are not going well with me, I am not keeping going. Please,
masters, give <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.”</p>
<p>“Sister, it is not allowable, approaching nuns’ quarters, to give <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to a nun,” they said, and being scrupulous they did not give it. Then the
lord, dressing in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, approached
Mahāpajāpatī the Gotamid, and having approached he sat down on the appointed
seat. As he was sitting down, the lord spoke thus to Mahāpajāpatī the Gotamid:</p>
<p>“Gotami, I hope things are going well with you, I hope you are keeping going.”</p>
<p>“Formerly, lord, monks who were elders, coming to me, gave <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>: because of this comfort came to be for me. But now they say it is forbidden
by the lord, and being scrupulous they do not give it; because of this comfort
does not come to be for me.”</p>
<p>Then the lord having … delighted Mahāpajāpatī the Gotamid with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, rising up from his seat, departed. Then the lord, on this occasion, in this
connection, having given <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, approaching nuns’ quarters, to exhort a nun who is ill.
And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.57" href="#Vin.4.57"></a>
</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, approaching nuns’ quarters, should exhort the nuns except at a
right time, there is an offence of expiation. This is a right time in this
case: if a nun comes to be ill; this, in this case, is a right time.”</span></p>

expiation.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Except at a right time</span> means:
<span class="gloss">setting aside a right time.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">An ill nun</span> means:

If he thinks that she is ordained when she is ordained, (and) approaching the
nuns’ quarters, exhorts her—except at a right time, there is an offence of
expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether she is ordained … at a right time,
there is an offence of expiation. If he thinks that she is not ordained when
she is ordained … at a right time, there is an offence of expiation. If he
exhorts (her) concerning a different rule, there is an offence of wrong-doing.
If he exhorts one who is ordained by one (Order only), there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he thinks that she is ordained when she is not ordained, there
is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether she is not
ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that she is not
ordained when she is not ordained, there is no offence.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.23.3.3" href="#Bu-Pc.23.3.3"></a>
There is no offence if it is at a right time, (in) giving an exposition, giving
an interrogation <span class="add">as <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bu-vb-pc22#Bu-Pc.22.2.3">Bu-Pc.22.2.3</a></span> … if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
