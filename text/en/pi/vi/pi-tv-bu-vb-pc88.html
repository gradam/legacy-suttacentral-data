… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks had a couch and a chair made covered with cotton.
People, having seen (this) as they were touring the dwelling-places, looked
down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the recluses, sons of the Sakyans, have a couch and a chair made
covered with cotton, like householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses?”
Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this group of six monks have a couch and a chair made covered with
cotton?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, had … covered with cotton?” “It is
true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, have a couch and a chair made covered with cotton?
It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And
thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should have a couch or a chair made covered with cotton, there is
an offence of expiation involving tearing off.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… monk is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Couch</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there are four (kinds of) couch …</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.93" href="#BD.3.93"></a>
<span class="term">Chair</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there are four (kinds of) chair … one with removable legs. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.170" href="#Vin.4.170"></a>
</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Cotton</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there are three (kinds of) cotton: cotton from trees, cotton from creepers,
cotton from grass.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should have made</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he makes (it) or causes it to be made, in the business there is an offence
of wrong-doing; having torn it off on acquisition, an offence of expiation is
to be confessed.</span></p>
<p>If what was incompletely executed by himself he has finished by himself … If he
makes others finish what was incompletely finished by others, there is an
offence of expiation. If he makes it or causes it to be made for another, there
is an offence of wrong-doing. If, having acquired what was made for another, he
makes use of it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.88.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.88.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if it is for a binding, for a girdle, for a shoulder-strap,
for a bag for carrying the bowl in, for a water-strainer; if he is making a
squatting-mat; if, having acquired what was made for another, having torn it
off, he makes use of it; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
