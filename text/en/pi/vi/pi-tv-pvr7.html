down) on a concealed seat, he falls into (the offence of) teaching <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> to women in more than five or six sentences, and he lives full of aspirations

association with families there is a constant seeing of the women-folk, if
there is seeing there is contact, if there is contact there is intimacy, if

be expected for the monk: either he will fare the Brahma-faring dissatisfied or

revert to the secular life.</li>

having recited the two Undetermined Offences, the rest may be announced as
though it had been heard (already): this is the fourth purification; recital in
full is the fifth.</li>
<li>And five further purifications: recital of the rules, Observance when there is
entire purity, Observance when there is determination, Invitation, and the
fifth is Observance with “being all together”.</li>
<li>Five advantages for an expert in Discipline: his own body of moral habit is
well guarded.well protected; he is a shelter for those who are affected by
scruples; confidently he lives in the midst of an Order; with <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> he restrains adversaries (of the Teaching) from one who is well restrained; he
is one who practises for the stability of True <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i>.</li>
