… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. At that time a
certain man said to another man: “I will present master Upananda, the son of
the Sakyans, with a robe.” Then he said: “I also will present master Upananda,
the son of the Sakyans, with a robe.” A certain monk who was going for alms
heard this conversation of these men. Then this monk approached the venerable
Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, and having approached, he said to the
venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans:</p>
<p>“You, reverend Upananda, are of great merit; on a certain occasion a <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.218" href="#Vin.3.218"></a>
certain man said to another man: ‘I will present master Upananda, the son of
the Sakyans, with a robe.’ Then he said: ‘I also will present master Upananda,
the son of the Sakyans with a robe.’” ‘Your reverence, these (men) are my
supporters.’ Then the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, approached
these men, and having approached, he said to these men:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, sirs, desire to present me with robes?”</p>
<p>“Did we not think, master: ‘We will present master Upananda with robes?’”</p>
<p>“If you, sirs, desire to present me with robes, present me with a robe like
this. What shall I do with ones presented that I cannot make use of?”</p>
<p>Then these men … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“These recluses, sons of the Sakyans, have great desires, they are not
contented. It is not easy to present them with robes. How can master Upananda,
before being invited by us, approaching, put forward a consideration with
regard to a robe?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.59" href="#BD.2.59"></a>
Monks heard these men who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying: “How can the venerable Upananda, the son of the
Sakyans, before being invited, approaching householders, put forward a
consideration with regard to a robe?” Then these monks told this matter to the
lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Upananda, before being invited, approaching
householders, put forward a consideration with regard to a robe?” “It is true,
lord,” he said.</p>
<p>“Are they relations of yours, Upananda, or not relations?”</p>
<p>“They are not relations, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>“Foolish man, one who is not a relation does not know what is suitable or what
is unsuitable, or what is right or what is wrong for those who are not
relations. Thus you, foolish man, before being invited, approaching
householders who are not relations, will put forward a consideration with
regard to a robe. It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet)
pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“
<span class="rule">In case various robe-funds come to be laid by for a monk by two men
householders or by (two) women householders who are not relations (of his),
thinking: ‘We will present the monk so and so with robes, having got various
robes in exchange for the various robe-funds.’ Then if that monk, out of desire
for something fine, approaching before being invited, should put forward a
consideration with regard to a robe, saying: ‘Indeed it would be well; do let
the venerable ones, having got a robe like this or like that in exchange for
the various robe-funds, present it to me, the two together with one,’ there is
an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span>

<p>If, according to what he says, they get in exchange one that is long or wide or

small value in exchange while they desire to get something costly in exchange;
