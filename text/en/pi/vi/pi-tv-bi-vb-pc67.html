… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
nuns ordained a girl married for full twelve years and who had trained for two
years in the six rules, but who was not agreed upon by the Order. Nuns spoke
thus: “Come, probationers, … <span class="add"><a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bi-vb-pc64#Bi-Pc.64.1">Bi-Pc.64.1</a></span> …” … “How can these nuns ordain a girl married for full twelve years and who
has trained for two years in the six rules, but who is not agreed upon by the
Order?” … he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to give the agreement as to ordination to a girl married
for full twelve years and who has trained for two years in the six rules. And
thus, monks, should it be given: That girl married for full twelve years <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.324" href="#Vin.4.324"></a>
and who has trained for two years in the six rules, having approached the Order
… <span class="add"><a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bi-vb-pc63#Bi-Pc.63.1">Bi-Pc.63.1</a></span> … should speak thus:
<span class="kamma">‘Ladies, I, so and so, a girl married for full twelve years and who has trained
under the lady so and so for two years in the six rules, request the Order for
the agreement as to ordination.’ And a second time … <span class="add">
<a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bi-vb-pc63#Bi-Pc.63.1">Bi-Pc.63.1</a>.
<em>Instead of</em> probationer
<em>read</em> girl married for full twelve years and who has trained for two years in the
six rules; <em>instead of</em> agreement as to training for two years in the six rules
<em>read</em> agreement as to ordination</span> …</span>
<span class="kamma">‘So do I understand this.’</span>”</p>
<p>Then the lord, having rebuked these nuns in many a figure for their weakness in
maintaining themselves … “… this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should ordain a girl married for full twelve years and who has
trained for two years in the six rules (but) who is not agreed upon by the
Order, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="gloss">the agreement as to ordination is not given by a (formal) act at which the
motion is followed by one proclamation.</span></p>

<p>There is no offence if she ordains a girl married for full twelve years who has
trained for two years in the six rules and who is agreed upon by the Order; if
she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
