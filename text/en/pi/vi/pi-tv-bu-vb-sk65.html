… in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks taught
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) who was sitting down, lolling … “…</p>
<p>‘I will not teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) who is sitting down, lolling (and) who is not ill,’ is a training
to be observed.”</p>
<p>Dhamma should not be taught to (someone) sitting down, lolling, (and) who is
not ill. Whoever out of disrespect teaches <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) who is sitting down, lolling on his hands or lolling on his robes
(and) who is not ill, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>There is no offence if it is unintentional … if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
