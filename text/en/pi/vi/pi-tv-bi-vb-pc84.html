… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six nuns used sunshades and sandals. People … spread it about,
saying: “How can these nuns use sunshades and sandals, like women householders
who enjoy pleasures of the senses?” Nuns heard these people who … spread it
about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can this
group of six nuns use sunshades and sandals?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks … and sandals?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can … and sandals? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are
not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“Whatever nun should use a sunshade and sandals, there is an offence of
expiation.”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for nuns came to be laid down by the lord.</p>

At that time a certain nun came to be ill;
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.338" href="#Vin.4.338"></a>
there was no comfort for her without a sunshade and sandals. They told this
matter to the lord. He said: “Monks, I allow a sunshade and sandals to a nun
who is ill. And thus, monks, let the nuns set forth this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun who is not ill should use a sunshade and sandals, there is an
offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Who is not ill</span> means:
<span class="gloss">for whom there is comfort without a sunshade and sandals.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.401" href="#BD.3.401"></a>
<span class="term">Who is ill</span> means:
<span class="gloss">for whom there is not comfort without a sunshade and sandals.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Sunshade</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there are three (kinds of) sunshade: white sunshade, sunshade of rushes,
sunshade of leaves, fastened at the middle, fastened to the rim.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should use</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if she uses (them) even once, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.84.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.84.2.2"></a>
If she thinks that she is not ill when she is not ill (and) uses a sunshade and
sandals, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as to whether she
is not ill … If she thinks that she is ill when she is not ill … offence of
expiation. If she uses a sunshade (but) not sandals, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If she uses sandals (but) not a sunshade, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is not ill when she is ill … If she is in
doubt as to whether she is ill, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she
thinks that she is ill when she is ill, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.84.2.3" href="#Bi-Pc.84.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she is ill; if she uses (them) in a monastery, in
monastery precincts; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first
wrong-doer.</p>
