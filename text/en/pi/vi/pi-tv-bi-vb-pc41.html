… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a bold design was made in a picture gallery in King Pasenadi of Kosala’s
pleasure grove. Many people went to see the picture gallery. The group of six
nuns also went to see the picture gallery. People … spread it about, saying:
“How can this group of six nuns go to see the picture gallery, like women
householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses?” Nuns heard these people who …
spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can
this group of six nuns go to see a picture gallery?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six nuns went to see a
picture gallery?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can this group of six nuns go to see a picture gallery? It is not,
monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should go to see a king’s pleasure house or a picture gallery or a
park or a pleasure grove or a lotus pond, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p>If she goes to see, there is an offence of wrong-doing. Standing where she
sees, there is an offence of expiation. Having left the region of sight, if she
sees again, there is an offence of expiation. If she goes to see one or the
other, there is an offence of wrong-doing. Standing where she sees, there is an
offence of expiation. Having left the region of sight, if she sees again, there
is an offence of expiation. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.299" href="#Vin.4.299"></a>

There is no offence if, standing in a monastery, she sees; if she sees as she
is going out or coming in; if she sees, having gone out as there is something
to be done; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first
wrong-doer.</p>
