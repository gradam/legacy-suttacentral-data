<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-An.1.1"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1803"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time Venerable Udāyī associated with and visited a number of families in Sāvatthī. One of the families that supported him had given their daughter in marriage to the son of another family. Then, after dressing in the morning, Venerable Udāyī took his bowl and robe and went to the first of those families. When he arrived, he asked where the daughter was, and he was told that she had been given to another family. That family too supported Venerable Udāyī. He then went there and again asked where the girl was. They said, “She is sitting in her room, Venerable.” He then went to that girl, and the two of them sat down alone on a private and secluded seat suitable for doing it. There he spoke to her on the Dhamma, or they just chatted together if the situation allowed.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1804"></a>At that time Visākhā, the mother of Migāra, had many <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.331"></a> healthy children and grandchildren, and she was considered very auspicious. At sacrifices, festivals, and celebrations people would feed Visākhā first. Just then she had been invited to the family that supported Venerable Udāyī. When she arrived there, she saw him sitting alone with that girl, and she said to Venerable Udāyī: “Bhante, it’s not appropriate that you should sit alone with a woman on a private and secluded seat suitable for doing it. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.188"></a> Although you may not be aiming at that activity, people with little confidence are hard to convince.” But Venerable Udāyī did not listen. After she had left, Visākhā informed the monks about what had happened. The monks of few desires … complained and criticised him: “How can Venerable Udāyī sit alone with a woman on a private and secluded seat suitable for doing it?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1805"></a>After rebuking Venerable Udāyī in many ways, they informed the Master … “Is it true, Udāyī, that you sat alone with a woman on a private and secluded seat suitable for doing it?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked him: “… Foolish man, how could you sit alone with a woman on a such a seat? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2 class="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1806"></a>“If a monk sits alone with a <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.332"></a> woman on a private and secluded seat suitable for doing it, and a trustworthy female lay disciple sees him and accuses him of an offence entailing expulsion or an offence entailing suspension or an offence entailing confession, then, if he admits to the sitting, he is to be dealt with according to one of these three or according to what that trustworthy female lay disciple has said. This rule is undetermined.”</p>
