… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
Ārohanta, a chief minister, had gone forth among the monks (and) his former
wife had gone forth among the nuns. Now at that time that monk participated in
a meal in the presence of that nun. Then that nun enticed that monk, standing
near him with drinking water and with a fan as he was eating. Then that monk
upbraided that nun, saying: “Do not, sister, do this, it is not allowable.”</p>
<p>“Formerly you did this and that to me, now you do not put up with this much,”
and having thrown down the drinking cup on his head, she struck him with the
fan. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this nun strike a monk?’ …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that a nun struck a monk?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can a nun strike a monk? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who
are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should stand with drinking water or <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.253" href="#BD.3.253"></a>
with a fan close to a monk while he is eating, there is an offence of
expiation.”</span></p>

If she thinks that he is ordained when he is ordained (and) stands close with
drinking water or with a fan, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in
doubt as to whether he is ordained … If she thinks that he is not ordained when
he is ordained … there is an offence of expiation. If she stands close having
left a reach of the hand, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she stands
close while he is eating solid food, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she
stands close to one who is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If
she thinks that he is ordained when he is not ordained, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether he is not ordained, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that he is not ordained when he is not
ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>

<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.254" href="#BD.3.254"></a>
There is no offence if she gives; if she causes (another) to give; if she
commands one who is not ordained; if she is mad, if she is the first
wrong-doer.</p>
