… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a certain nun frequented a certain woman’s family. Then that woman spoke thus
to that nun: “Please, lady, give this petticoat to such and such a woman.” Then
that nun, thinking: “If I go away taking it in my bowl, there will be trouble
for me,” went away having tied it on. When she was on the high road the strings
broke and were scattered. People … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns
wear a petticoat, like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses?”
Nuns … heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.340" href="#Vin.4.340"></a>
… spread it about, saying: “How can this nun wear a petticoat?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that a nun wore a petticoat?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can a nun wear a petticoat? It is not, monks, for pleasing those
who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should wear a petticoat, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Petticoat</span> means:
<span class="gloss">whatever goes about the hips.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should wear</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if she wears it even once, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

There is no offence if it is on account of illness; if she wears a hip-string;
if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
