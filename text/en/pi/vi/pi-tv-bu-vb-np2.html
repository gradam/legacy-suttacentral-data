At one time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta
Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. At that time monks, entrusting robes to the
hands of (other) monks, set out on a tour of the country with (only) an inner
and an upper robe; these robes, deposited for a long time, became soiled; the
monks dried them in the sun. The venerable Ānanda, as he was engaged in touring
the lodgings, saw these monks drying these robes in the sun. Seeing these monks
he came up to them, and having come up he said to these monks:</p>
<p>“Your reverences, whose are these robes that are soiled?” Then these monks told
this matter to the venerable Ānanda. The venerable Ānanda looked down upon,
criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the monks, entrusting robes to the hands of (other) monks, set out on
a tour of the country with (only) an inner and an upper robe?” Then the
venerable Ānanda told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that monks, entrusting robes to the hands of
(other) monks, set out on a tour of the country with (only) an inner and an
upper robe?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.13" href="#BD.2.13"></a>
“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can these foolish men, having entrusted robes to the hands of
(other) monks, set out on a tour of the country with (only) an inner and an
upper robe? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …
And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“When the robe-material is settled, when a monk’s <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges) have been removed, if this monk should be away, separated from
his three robes, even for one night, there is an offence of expiation involving
forfeiture.”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-NP.2.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.2.2.1" href="#Bu-NP.2.2.1"></a>
At that time a certain monk became ill in Kosambī. Relations sent a messenger
to this monk, saying: “Let the revered sir come, we will nurse (him).” The <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.14" href="#BD.2.14"></a>
monks said: “Go, your reverence, relations will nurse you.” He said:</p>
<p>“Your reverences, a rule of training laid down by the lord is that one should
not be away, separated from the three robes; but I am ill, I am not able to set
out taking the three robes. I <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.199" href="#Vin.3.199"></a>
will not go.”</p>
<p>They told this matter to the lord. Then the lord, on this occasion, in this
connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to give a monk who is ill the agreement (to be regarded)
as not away, separated from the three robes. And thus, monks, should it be
given: That monk who is ill, approaching the Order, arranging his upper robe
over one shoulder, honouring the feet of the senior monks, sitting down on his
haunches, saluting with joined palms, should speak thus: <span class="kamma">‘I, honoured sirs, am ill, I am not able to set out taking the three robes.
Thus I, honoured sirs, request the Order for the agreement (to be regarded) as
not away, separated from the three robes.’</span> A second time it should be requested, a third time it should be requested. The
Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This monk so and so is ill, he is
not able to set out taking the three robes. He requests the Order for the
agreement (to be regarded) as not away, separated from the three robes. If it
seems right to the Order, let the Order give this monk so and so the agreement
(to be regarded) as not away, separated from the three robes. This is the
motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.15" href="#BD.2.15"></a>
me … the three robes. The Order gives the monk so and so the agreement (to be
regarded) as not away, separated from the three robes. If the giving to the
monk so and so of the agreement (to be regarded) as not away, separated from
the three robes, is pleasing to the venerable ones, let them be silent; if it
is not pleasing, they should speak. Agreement (to be regarded) as not away,
separated from the three robes, is given by the Order to the monk so and so,
and it is pleasing to the venerable ones; therefore they are silent, so do I
understand this.’</span> And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">When the robe-material is settled, when a monk’s <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges) have been removed, if this monk should be away, separated from
the three robes, even for one night, except on the agreement of the monks,
there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>

<span class="term">When the robe-material is settled</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the robe-material is made up for a monk, or lost or destroyed or burnt, or an
expectation of robe-material is disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">When the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges) have been removed</span> means:
<span class="gloss">they come to be removed because of a certain one of eight grounds, or they come
to be removed before the time by the Order.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">If this monk should be away, separated from the three robes, even for one night</span> means:
<span class="gloss">without the outer cloak, or without the upper robe, or without the inner robe.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Except on the agreement of the monks</span> means:
<span class="gloss">setting aside the agreement of the monks.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">There is an offence involving forfeiture</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is to be forfeited at sunrise; it should be forfeited to the Order, or to a
group, or to an individual. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited … <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.200" href="#Vin.3.200"></a>
<span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, these three robes were away, separated from me <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.16" href="#BD.2.16"></a>
for a night, without the agreement of the monks (and) are to be forfeited. I
forfeit them to the Order …’</span>
<span class="kamma">‘… should give back … let the venerable ones give back … I will give back this
robe to the venerable one.’</span></span></p>
