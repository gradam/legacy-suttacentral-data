<h1>Monks’ Relinquishment 2: outbuildings</h1>
</div>
<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>
<h3 class="anunidana1">First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.12">BD.2.12</a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.2.1">Bu-NP.2.1</a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.198">Vin.3.198</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1883"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time some monks stored one of their robes with other monks and then left to travel the countryside with a lower and an upper robe. Because they were stored for a long time, the robes became mouldy, and the monks put them out in the sun.</p>
<p>While inspecting the lodgings, Venerable Ānanda saw the monks sunning those robes. He asked them: “Whose are these mouldy robes?” And they told him what had happened. Venerable Ānanda complained and criticised them: “How can the monks store one of their robes with other monks and then leave to travel the countryside with a lower and an upper robe ?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1884"></a>After criticising those monks in many ways, Venerable Ānanda informed the Master. … “Is it true, monks, that some monks store one of their robes with other monks and then leave to travel the countryside with a lower and an upper robe ?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.13">BD.2.13</a>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, criticised them: “… How could these foolish men store one of their robes with other monks and then leave to travel the countryside with a lower and an upper robe? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3 class="anupannatti1">Preliminary ruling</h3>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1885"></a>“When his robe is finished and the <i>kathina</i> period has ended, if a monk stays apart from his three robes even for a single day, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession.”</p>
<p class="endsection"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1886"></a>In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3 class="anunidana2">Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.2.2">Bu-NP.2.2</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1887"></a> At one time a certain monk was sick in Kosambī. His relatives sent a message to that monk: “Come, bhante, we will attend to you.” Other <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.14">BD.2.14</a> monks urged him to go, but he said: “The Master has laid down a training rule that you cannot be apart from your three robes. Because I am sick, I am not able to travel with all three robes, and therefore I <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.199">Vin.3.199</a> cannot go.”</p>
<p>They informed the Master. He then spoke on the Dhamma and addressed the monks:</p>
<p>“Monks, I allow you to give permission to a sick monk to stay apart from his three robes. And it should be given in this way. After approaching the Sangha, the sick monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay homage at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his haunches, put the palms of his hands together, and say: ‘<span class="kamma">Bhante, I am sick. I am not able to travel with my three robes. I ask the Sangha for permission to stay apart from my three robes.</span>’ And he should ask a second and a third time. An experienced and competent monk should then inform the Sangha:</p>
<div class="kamma">
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1888"></a>“‘Bhante, let the Sangha listen to me. This monk so-and-so is sick. He is not able to travel with his three robes. He is asking the Sangha for permission to stay apart from his three robes. If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes. This is the motion.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1889"></a>“‘Bhante, let the Sangha listen to <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.15">BD.2.15</a> me. This monk so-and-so is sick. He is not able to travel with his three robes. He is asking the Sangha for permission to stay apart from his three robes. The Sangha gives permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes. Any monk who agrees to giving permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes should remain silent. Any monk who does not agree should say so.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1890"></a>“‘The Sangha has given permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’</p>
</div>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1891"></a>“And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2 class="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1892"></a>“When his robe is finished and the <i>kathina</i> period has ended, if a monk stays apart from his three robes even for a single day, unless he has the permission of the monks, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession.”</p>

<p>He commits the offence entailing relinquishment at dawn. The robe is to be relinquished to a Sangha, a group, or an individual.</p>
