… at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding-place. Now at that
time the family who supported the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans,
invited the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, to a meal, and they
invited other monks to the meal. Now at that time the venerable Upananda, the
son of the Sakyans, used to visit families before the meal. Then these monks
said to these people:</p>
<p>“Sirs, give the meal.”</p>
<p>“Wait, honoured sirs, until master Upananda comes.” A second time these monks …
A third time these monks said to these people:</p>
<p>“Sirs, give the meal before the right time passes.” A third time they said:</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, we made the meal on account of master Upananda. Wait, honoured
sirs, until master Upananda comes.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, having visited families
before the meal, returned during the day. The monks did not eat as much as
expected. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, being invited, and
being (provided) with a meal, call upon families before the meal?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Upananda, being invited, and being
(provided) with a meal, called upon families before the meal?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.363" href="#BD.2.363"></a>
“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, being invited … before the meal? It is not, foolish
man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule
of training should be set forth:</p>
<p><span class="subrule">“Whatever monk, being invited, and being (provided) with a meal, should call
upon families before the meal, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.46.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.46.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.46.2.1"></a>
Now at that time the family who supported the venerable Upananda, the son of
the Sakyans, sent solid food for the Order, saying:</p>
<p>“Pointing it out as for master Upananda, it should be given to the Order.” Now
at that time the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, had entered the
village for alms-food. Then these people, having gone to the monastery, asked
the monks: “Where, honoured sirs, is master Upananda?” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.99" href="#Vin.4.99"></a>
</p>
<p>“Sirs, this venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, has entered the village
for alms-food.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, pointing out this solid food as for master Upananda, it should
be given to the Order.”</p>
<p>They told this matter to the lord. Then the lord on this occasion, in this
connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Well then, monks, having accepted it, put it aside until Upananda comes back.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, thinking, “It is forbidden
by the lord to call upon families before a meal,” having visited families after
a meal, returned during the day. The solid food was <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.364" href="#BD.2.364"></a>
left over. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, call on families after
a meal?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Upananda, called on families after a meal?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, call on families after a meal? It is not, foolish
man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule
of training should be set forth:</p>
<p><span class="subrule">“Whatever monk, being invited, and being (provided) with a meal, should call
upon families before a meal or after a meal, there is an offence of
expiation.”</span></p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.46.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.46.3.1" href="#Bu-Pc.46.3.1"></a>
Now at that time scrupulous monks, at the time of giving robes, did not visit
families; little robe-material accrued. They told this matter to the lord. He
said:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, at the time of giving robes, to visit families. And thus,
monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p><span class="subrule">“Whatever monk, being invited, and being (provided) with a meal, should call
upon families before a meal or after a meal, except at the right time, there is
an offence of expiation. In this case this is the right time: the time of
giving robes; this is the right time in this case.” And thus this rule of
training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.46.4"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.46.4.1" href="#Bu-Pc.46.4.1"></a>
Now at that time monks were making robes and they came to be in need of needles
and thread and <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.365" href="#BD.2.365"></a>
scissors. The monks, being scrupulous, did not visit families. They told this
matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, at the time of making robes, to visit families. And thus,
monks, this rule of training should be set forth: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.100" href="#Vin.4.100"></a>
</p>
<p><span class="subrule">“Whatever monk, being invited and being (provided) with a meal, should call
upon families before a meal or after a meal, except at the right time, there is
an offence of expiation. In this case this is the right time: the time of
giving robes, the time of making robes; this is the right time in this case.”</span></p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.46.5"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.46.5.1" href="#Bu-Pc.46.5.1"></a>
Now at that time monks became ill and came to be in need of medicines. The
monks, being scrupulous, did not visit families…</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to visit families, having asked (for permission) if a monk
be there. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, being invited and being (provided) with a meal, not having asked
(for permission) if a monk be there, should call upon families before a meal or
after a meal, except at a right time, there is an offence of expiation. In this
case a right time is the time of giving robes, the time of making robes; this
is the right time in this case.”</span></p>

If he thinks that he is invited when he is invited (and), except at the right
time, calls on families before the meal or after the meal, not having asked
(for permission) if a monk be there, there is an offence of expiation. If he is
in doubt as to whether he is invited … If he thinks that he is not invited when
he is <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.367" href="#BD.2.367"></a>
invited … offence of expiation. If he thinks that he is invited when he is not

There is no offence, if at the right time, he enters having asked (for

if a monk be not there; if the way is through the house of another; if the way

other sects; if he is going on his way back; if he is going to a house for
