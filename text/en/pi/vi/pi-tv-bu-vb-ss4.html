<h1>Monks’ Suspension 4: Attending to one’s own desires</h1>
</div>
<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.222">BD.1.222</a><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Ss.4.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.4.1.1">Bu-Ss.4.1.1</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1180"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time Venerable Udāyī associated with and visited a number of families. Then, having dressed in the morning, Venerable Udāyī took his bowl and robe and went to the house of a beautiful widow, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.132">Vin.3.132</a>where he sat down on the prepared seat. That woman approached Venerable Udāyī, paid homage to him and sat down to one side. Venerable Udāyī instructed, inspired and gladdened her with a Dhamma talk. She then said, “Bhante, please say what you need. I am able to give robes, almsfood, lodging requisites, and medicines.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1181"></a>“It’s not hard for us, sister, to get those requisites. Give instead what is hard for us to get.”</p>
<p>“What is that, bhante?”</p>
<p>“Sexual intercourse.”</p>
<p>“Is it needed now, bhante?”</p>
<p>“It is, sister.”</p>
<p>“Come, bhante,” and she entered her bedroom, took off her clothes, and lay back on the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.223">BD.1.223</a>bed. Venerable Udāyī approached her and spat out, “Who would touch this foul-smelling wretch?” and he departed.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1182"></a>Then that woman complained and criticised him: “These Sakyan recluses are shameless, immoral, and liars. … <span class="add">To be expanded as in <a href="/en/pi-tv-bu-vb-ss2#Bu-Ss.2.1.1">Bu-Ss.2.1.1</a>.</span> … How can the ascetic Udāyī request sexual intercourse of me, and then spit out, “Who would touch this foul-smelling wretch?” and depart? What is bad about me? How am I foul-smelling? In what way am I inferior to whom?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1183"></a>Other women, too, criticised him in the same way, <a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.4.1.2">Bu-Ss.4.1.2</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1184"></a>and the monks heard them. The monks of few desires … complained and criticised him: <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.224">BD.1.224</a>“How can Venerable Udāyī, in the presence of a woman, praise attending to his own desires?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1185"></a>Those monks rebuked Venerable Udāyī in many ways and then informed the Master. And the Master convened the Sangha <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.133">Vin.3.133</a>and questioned Venerable Udāyī:</p>
<p>“Is it true, Udāyī, that you praised attending to your own desires in the presence of a woman?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked him: “It’s not suitable, foolish man, it’s not becoming, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a recluse, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could you, in the presence of a woman, praise attending to your own desires? Have I not taught the Dhamma in many ways for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion … for the stilling of the fevers of sense desire? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2 class="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1186"></a><span class="rule">“If a monk, lustful and with a distorted mind, in the presence of a woman praises attending to his own desires: ‘Sister, she provides the highest service who attends in this way to a virtuous one like me, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.225">BD.1.225</a> a celibate, one of good character,’ and if it is a reference to sexual intercourse, he commits an offence entailing suspension.”</span></p>
