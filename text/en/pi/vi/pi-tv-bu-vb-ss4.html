… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. At that time the
venerable Udāyin was dependent on families, and approached many families. Now
at that time there was a certain woman who was a widow, beautiful, good to look
upon, lovely. Then the venerable Udāyin, rising early and taking his robe and
bowl, came up to this woman’s dwelling <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.132" href="#Vin.3.132"></a>
and having come up he sat down on the appointed seat. Then this woman
approached the venerable Udāyin, and having approached she greeted the
venerable Udāyin and sat down to one side. As she was sitting to one side the
venerable Udāyin rejoiced, pleased, gladdened, delighted this woman with talk
on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Then this woman having been … delighted with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> by the venerable Udāyin, said to the venerable Udāyin:</p>
<p>“Do say, honoured sir, what (will be) of use; we are able to give to the
master, that is to say, the requisites of robes, alms-food, lodgings and
medicine for the sick.”</p>
<p>“It is not hard, sister, for us to come by those things, that is to say, the
requisites of robes, alms-food, lodgings, medicine for the sick. Give what is
hard for us to come by.”</p>
<p>“What is that, honoured sir?”</p>
<p>“Sexual intercourse,” he said.</p>
<p>“(Will it be) of use, honoured sir,” she said.</p>
<p>“(It will be) of use, sister.”</p>
<p>“Come, honoured sir,” she said, and entering into an inner room, taking off her
cloak, she lay back on the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.223" href="#BD.1.223"></a>
couch. Then the venerable Udāyin approached this woman, and having approached
her he said:</p>
<p>“Who could touch this evil-smelling wretch?” and he departed spitting.</p>
<p>Then this woman became annoyed, vexed, angry and said:</p>
<p>“These recluses, sons of the Sakyans are shameless, of low morality, liars. And
they pretend to be those walking by <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, walking by right, leading the Brahma-life, speaking truth, virtuous, of good
conduct. Among these there is no recluseship, among these there is no
brahminhood. Perished is recluseship among these, perished is brahminhood among
these. Where is recluseship among these? Where is brahminhood among these?
Fallen from recluseship are these, fallen from brahminhood are these. How can
this recluse Udāyin, having himself begged me for sexual intercourse, say: ‘Who
could touch this evil-smelling wretch’ and depart spitting? What is bad in me?
What is evil-smelling in me? In what am I inferior to whom?”</p>
<p>Other women became annoyed, vexed, angry and said: “These recluses, sons of the
Sakyans, are shameless … How can this recluse Udāyin, having himself begged
this (woman) for sexual intercourse, say: ‘Who could touch this evil-smelling
wretch?’ and depart spitting? What is bad in her? What is evil-smelling in her?
In what is she inferior to whom?”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.4.1.2" href="#Bu-Ss.4.1.2"></a>
The monks heard these women who were annoyed, vexed and angry. Those who were
modest monks became annoyed, vexed, angry and said:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.224" href="#BD.1.224"></a>
“How can this venerable Udāyin speak in praise of ministering to
sense-pleasures for self in the presence of women-folk?”</p>
<p>Then these monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord for this reason,
on this occasion, having had the Order of monks convened, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.133" href="#Vin.3.133"></a>
questioned the venerable Udāyin, saying:</p>
<p>“Is it true as is said that you, Udāyin, spoke in praise of ministering to
sense-pleasures for self in the presence of women-folk?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him saying:</p>
<p>“It is not right, foolish man, it is not becoming, it is not suitable, it is
not worthy of a recluse, it is out of place, it is not to be done. How can you,
foolish man, speak in praise of ministering to sense-pleasures for self in the
presence of women-folk? Foolish man, is not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> preached by me in various ways for the stilling of passion … the allaying of
the flames of sense-pleasures declared? It is not, foolish man, for the benefit
of unbelievers …Thus, monks, this course of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, affected by desire, with perverted heart, should speak in praise
of ministering to sense-pleasures for self in the presence of women-folk,
saying: ‘Sister, this is the highest kind of ministration: that a woman should
minister to one like me, virtuous, of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.225" href="#BD.1.225"></a>
good conduct, leading the Brahma-life, in this fashion’—meaning with what is
connected with sexual intercourse—that is an offence entailing a formal meeting
of the Order.”</span></p>

If there is a woman, if he is infatuated thinking her to be a woman, and if the
monk speaks in praise, in the woman’s presence, of ministering to
sense-pleasures for self, it is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the
Order.</p>
<p>If there are two women, if … thinking they are two women … there are two
offences … a formal meeting of the Order.</p>
<p>If there are a woman and an eunuch, if … thinking them both to be women … there
is an offence of wrong-doing with an offence entailing a formal meeting of the
Order.</p>

There is no offence if he speaks, saying: “Support (us) with the requisites of
robes, alms-food, lodgings, medicine for the sick,” if he is mad, if he is a
