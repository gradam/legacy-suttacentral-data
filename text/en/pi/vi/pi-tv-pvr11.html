Four legal questions: a legal question concerning disputes, a legal question concerning censure, a legal question concerning offences, a legal question concerning obligations These are the four legal questions. Of these four legal questions how many openings up are there? Of these four legal questions there are ten openings up. Of a legal question concerning disputes there are two openings up. Of a legal question concerning censure there are four openings up. Of a legal question concerning offences there are three openings up. Of a legal question concerning obligations there is one opening up. These are the ten openings up of these four legal questions. In opening up a legal question concerning disputes … censure offences … obligations, how many decidings does one open up? In opening up a legal question concerning disputes one opens up two decidings. In opening up a legal question concerning censure one opens up four decidings. In opening up a legal question concerning offences one opens up three decidings. In opening up a legal question concerning obligations one opens up one deciding.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.11.1.2" href="#Prv.11.1.2"></a>
How many openings up? In how many ways does one bring about an opening up? Of how many qualities is an individual who opens up a legal question possessed? How many individuals, in opening up a legal question, fall into an offence?</p>
<p>Twelve openings up. In ten ways does one bring about an opening up. An individual who is possessed of four qualities opens up a legal question. Four individuals in opening up a legal question fall into an offence.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.11.1.3" href="#Prv.11.1.3"></a>
What are the twelve openings up? Saying: The formal act is not carried out, the formal act is badly carried out, the formal act should be carried out again; it is not fixed, it is badly fixed, it should be fixed again; it is not decided, it is
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.245" href="#BD.6.245"></a>
 badly decided, it should be decided again; it is not settled, it is badly settled, it should be settled again—these twelve openings up.</p>
<p>
In what ten ways does one bring about an opening up? He opens up a legal question where it arose; he opens up a legal question settled where it arose; he opens up a legal question on a highway; he opens up a legal question settled on a highway; he opens up a legal question when he has arrived there; he opens up a legal question settled when he has arrived there; he opens up a verdict of innocence; he opens up a verdict of past insanity; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.5.151" href="#Vin.5.151"></a>
he opens up a decision for specific depravity; he opens up a covering over (as) with grass. In these ten ways one brings about an opening up.</p>
<p>Of what four qualities is an individual possessed that he opens up a legal question? Following a wrong course through partiality … hatred … confusion … fear he opens up a legal question. Possessed of these four qualities an individual opens up a legal question.</p>
<p>Who are the four individuals who in opening up a legal question fall into an offence? If one who was ordained that very day opens (it) up, for opening up there is an offence of Expiation. If an incoming monk … if one who carried out (the legal question) … if one who has given his consent opens (it) up, for opening up there is an offence of Expiation. These four individuals, in opening up, fall into an offence.</p>

Is a legal question concerning disputes an offence or not an offence?

<p>Of the four fallings away, to how many fallings away do these offences appertain? Of the four legal questions which legal question? Of the seven classes of offence in how many classes of offence are they comprised? Of the six origins of offences by how many origins do they originate? By how many legal questions, among how many possibilities, by how many decidings are they stopped?</p>

Of the seven classes of offence they are comprised in two classes of offence: it may be in the class of offence of Expiation; it may be in the class of offence of wrong-doing. Of the six origins of offences they originate by three origins. By one legal question: by the legal question concerning obligations; by three possibilities: in the midst of an Order, in the midst of a group, in the presence of an individual; by three decidings are they stopped: it may be by a verdict in the presence of and by the carrying out on his acknowledgement; it may be by a verdict in the Presence of and by a covering over (as) with grass.</p>

<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.248" href="#BD.6.248"></a>
 a legal question concerning censure: if he defames a monk with an unfounded charge of an offence involving Defeat there is an offence requiring a Formal Meeting of the Order; if he defames with an unfounded charge of an offence requiring a Formal Meeting of the Order there is an offence of Expiation; if he defames with an unfounded charge of falling away from right behaviour there is an offence of wrong-doing. These are the three offences one falls into because of a legal question concerning censure.</p>
<p>Of the four fallings away, to how many … by how many decidings are they stopped?</p>
<p>
Of the four fallings away these offences appertain to two fallings away: it may be to falling away from moral habit; it may be to falling away from right behaviour. Of the four legal questions, the legal question
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.5.153" href="#Vin.5.153"></a>
concerning offences. Of the seven classes of offence they are comprised in three classes of offence: it may be in the class of offence requiring a Formal Meeting of the Order; it may be in the class of offence of Expiation; it may be in the class of offence of wrong-doing. Of the six origins of offence they originate by three origins. That which is a serious offence is an offence that is stopped by one legal question: the legal question concerning obligations; by one possibility: in the midst of the Order; by two decidings: by a verdict in the presence of and by the carrying out on his acknowledgement. Those which are slight offences are offences that are stopped by one legal question: the legal question concerning obligations; by three possibilities …

Is a legal question concerning offences an offence or not an offence? A legal question concerning offences is an offence—one could then fall into four offences because of a legal question concerning offences: if a nun knowingly conceals an offence involving Defeat there is an offence involving Defeat; if, being in doubt, she conceals it, there is a grave offence; if a monk conceals an offence requiring a Formal Meeting of the Order there is an offence of Expiation; if one conceals a falling away from good behaviour there is an offence of wrong-doing.
