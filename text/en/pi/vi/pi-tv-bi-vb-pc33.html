… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the nun Thullanandā was very learned, she was a repeater, she was wise, she was
skilled in giving <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk. Bhaddā Kāpilānī also was very learned … she was skilled in giving <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk, she was esteemed as being eminent. People, thinking: “Bhaddā Kāpilānī is
very learned … she is skilled in giving <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk, she is esteemed as being eminent,” having first visited Bhaddā Kāpilānī
afterwards visited the nun Thullanandā. The nun Thullanandā, overcome by envy,
thinking: “Those who are said to have few wants, to be content, detached, not
living in company, these are intent on convincing, intent on hinting,” walked
up and down and stood still and sat down and lay down on a sleeping-place and
recited and made (another) recite and studied in front of Bhaddā Kāpilānī.
Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the lady
Thullanandā intentionally cause discomfort to the lady Bhaddā Kāpilānī?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā intentionally caused
discomfort to Bhaddā Kāpilānī?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā intentionally <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.308" href="#BD.3.308"></a>
cause discomfort to Bhaddā Kāpilānī? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who
are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should intentionally cause discomfort to a nun, there is an
offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.33.2.1" href="#Bi-Pc.33.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">To a nun</span> means:
<span class="gloss">to another nun.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Intentionally</span> means:
<span class="gloss">a transgression committed knowingly, consciously, deliberately.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should cause discomfort</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if thinking, “Because of this there will be discomfort for her,” she walks up
and down or stands still or sits down or lies down on a sleeping-place or
recites or makes (another) recite or studies in front of (her) without asking
(for permission), there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.33.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.33.2.2"></a>
If she thinks that she is ordained when she is ordained (and) intentionally
causes discomfort, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as to
whether she is ordained … <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.291" href="#Vin.4.291"></a>
If she thinks that she is not ordained when she is ordained (and) intentionally
causes discomfort, there is an offence of expiation. If she intentionally
causes discomfort to one who is not ordained, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is ordained when she is not ordained, there
is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether she is not
ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is not
ordained when she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.33.2.3" href="#Bi-Pc.33.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she, not desiring to cause discomfort (and) having asked
(for permission), walks up and down … or studies in front of (her); if she is
mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
