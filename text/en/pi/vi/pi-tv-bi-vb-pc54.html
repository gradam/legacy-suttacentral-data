… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a certain brahmin, having invited nuns, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.311" href="#Vin.4.311"></a>
offered them food …” …</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, being invited or being satisfied, should eat or partake of solid
food or soft food, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Being invited</span> means:
<span class="gloss">being invited to any one meal of the five (kinds of) meals.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Being satisfied</span> means:
<span class="gloss">eating is to be seen, a meal is to be seen, standing within a reach of the
hand, she asks (her), a refusal is to be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Solid food</span> means:
<span class="gloss">setting aside the five (kinds of) meals, conjey, food (that may be eaten)

<p><span class="term">Soft food</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the five (kinds of) meals: … meat.</span></p>
<p>If she accepts, thinking: “I will eat, I will partake of,” there is an offence
of wrong-doing. For every mouthful, there is an offence of expiation. If she <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.349" href="#BD.3.349"></a>
accepts for the sake of nutriment (food to be eaten) during a watch of the
night, during seven days, during life, there is an offence of wrong-doing. For
every mouthful, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.54.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.54.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if, being invited (but) not being satisfied, she drinks
conjey; if she eats having asked the owner (for permission); if when there is a
reason she makes use of (food to be eaten) during a watch of the night, during
seven days, during life; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.312" href="#Vin.4.312"></a></p>
