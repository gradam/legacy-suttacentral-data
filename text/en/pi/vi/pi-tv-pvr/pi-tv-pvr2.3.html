Of the four fallings away how many fallings away do the offences for a nun who,
filled with desire, is consenting to physical contact with a man who is filled
with desire appertain to? Of the four fallings away the offences … appertain to
two fallings away: there may be falling away from moral habit; there may be
falling away from good behaviour … Of the four fallings away how many fallings
away do the offences for one who is partaking of curds, having had them asked
for, appertain to? … appertain to one falling away: falling away from good
behaviour.</p>
