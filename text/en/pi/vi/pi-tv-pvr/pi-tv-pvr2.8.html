Partaking of curds, having had them asked for, how many offences does she fall
into? Partaking of curds, having had them asked for, she falls into two
offences: as she accepts saying, “I will partake of,” the offence is one of
wrong-doing; for every mouthful the offence is one to be Confessed. Partaking
of curds … she falls into these two offences. Of the four fallings away how
many fallings away do these offences appertain to … by which deciding are they
stopped? Of the four fallings away these offences appertain to one falling
away; the falling away from good behaviour. Of the seven classes of offence
they are comprised in two classes of offence: it may be in the class of offence
that is to be Confessed; it may be in the class of offence of wrong-doing. Of
the six origins of offences they originate by four origins: it may be that they
originate by body, not by speech, not by mind; it may be that they originate by
body and by speech, not by mind; it may be that they originate by body and by
mind, not by speech; it may be that they originate by body and by speech and by
mind. Of the four legal questions the legal question concerning offences. Of
the seven decidings they are stopped by three … and by a covering over (as)
with grass.</p>
