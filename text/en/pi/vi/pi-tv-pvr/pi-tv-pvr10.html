stretching forth the joined palms in salutation,<br>
Hoping for what, for what purpose are you come here?”</p>

that come up for recitation on Observance days,<br>
How many are these rules of training? <br>
In how many towns laid down?”</p>

I will tell you truly (so that you may be) skilled herein.</p>
<p>The ‘layings-down’ in the two Disciplines <br>
that come up for recitation on Observance days—<br>
They are three hundred and fifty laid down in seven towns.”</p>
<p>“In which seven towns were they laid down? <br>
Please (give) me the answer to that. <br>
Listening to what is said, I will follow it <br>
so that it may be for our welfare.”</p>
<p>“The layings down were only in <br>
Vesālī, Rājagaha and Sāvatthī, at Āḷavī<br>
And Kosambī, and among the Sakyans <br>
and among the Bhaggas.”</p>

How many made in Rājagaha?<br>

eight made in Kosambī,<br>
Eight spoken among the Sakyans, <br>
three laid down among the Bhaggas.</p>
<p>Listen to those laid down in Vesālī as they really are:<br>
Intercourse, (human) being, further, extra, and black,</p>
<p>Fact, out-of-turn meal, cleansing the teeth, naked ascetic,<br>
And reviling among the nuns: these ten were made in Vesālī.</p>
<p>Listen to those laid down in Rājagaha as they really are:<br>
Taking what has not been given, <br>
and two in Rājagaha on an unfounded charge,</p>
<p>And two on schisms also, inner robe, silver, yarn,
<br>
and on making look down,<br>

Almsfood procured, group-meal, at a wrong time, <br>
and calling on,bathing, under twenty.</p>
<p>Having given away a robe, giving directions: <br>
these were made in Rājagaha.<br>
Mountain-top, walking, <br>
likewise by showing favouritism—twenty-one.</p>

Four Defeats, Formal Meetings of the Order come to sixteen.</p>

And there are the two Undetermined, twenty-four Forfeitures,<br>
And a hundred and fifty-six minor matters were pronounced,</p>
<p>Ten blameworthys, seventy-two Trainings:<br>
Two hundred and ninety-four were all made in Sāvatthī.</p>
<p>Listen to those laid down in Āḷavī as they really are:<br>
Hut, silk, sleeping-place, and on digging, “You go <i lang="pi">devatā</i>”<br>
And they sprinkled water that contained life: <br>
these six were made in Āḷavī.</p>
<p>Listen to those laid down in Kosambī as they really are:<br>
Large <i lang="pi">vihāra</i>, difficult to speak to, evasion, door, and spirits,<br>
Disrespect, regarding a rule, and the eighth is on a milk drink. /<br>
Listen to those laid down among the Sakyans as they really are:<br>
Sheep’s wool, bowl, and exhortation, and medicine also,</p>
<p>Needle, forest-gone—these six at Kapilavatthu.<br>
In water for cleansing, exhortation <br>
were pronounced among the nuns.</p>
<p>Listen to those laid down among the Bhaggas as they really are:<br>
Kindling a fire to warm themselves, <br>
(soiled) with food, with lumps of boiled rice.</p>
<p>Four Defeats, Formal Meetings of the Order come to seven,<br>
Eight Forfeitures, thirty-two minor matters,</p>
<p>Two blameworthys, three Trainings—fifty-six—

Wrong speech, and whoever reviles another desiring laughter: <br>

Weak in wisdom, wrapped in confusion, <br>
they misrepresent the Supreme Buddha: <br>
stopped is this that is falling away from right view.”</p>

<p>If for the sake of livelihood, for the reason of livelihood one of evil wishes,
overcome by desire, claims a non-existent state of further-men which is not
fact, there is an offence involving Defeat. If for the sake of livelihood, for
the reason of livelihood one speaks saying, “Whatever monk lives in your <i lang="pi">vihāra</i> is an arahant”; if for the sake of livelihood, for the reason of livelihood a
monk, having asked for sumptuous foods for himself, eats them; if for the sake
of livelihood, for the reason <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.238" href="#BD.6.238"></a>
of livelihood a nun, having asked for sumptuous foods for herself, eats them;
if for the sake of livelihood, for the reason of livelihood one who is not ill,
having asked for curry or conjey for himself, eats it—this that is a falling
away from right livelihood is stopped.</p>

Listen to that which is called Defeat as it really is:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Fallen away, fallen short of, and fallen down,<br>
destroyed by the true rules,<br>
For such a one there is no communion: <br>
it is so called because of that.</p>

<p>Listen to that which is called Formal Meeting as it really is:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Only the Order imposes probation,<br>
sends back to the beginning,<br>
inflicts <i lang="pi">mānatta</i>,
rehabilitates: <br>
it is so called because of that.</p>

<p>Undetermined, not determined—<br>
the rule is undecided,<br>
The occasion is (to be dealt with) by one of three (rules)—<br>
it is called Undetermined.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Whoever confesses instigation to another, <br>
and whoever accepts that—<br>

it is so called because of that.</p>

<p>In the midst of an Order, <br>
in the midst of a group, just to a single one—<br>
When forfeiting he confesses: <br>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>He throws off a skilled rule,<br>
offends against the <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> Way<br>
Because of confusion of his mind: <br>

Eating among those invited,<br>
a nun there directs from partiality,<br>
Not being refused, if he should eat of it: <br>

<p>A nun, not being a relation, whatever is cherished by others:<br>
Ghee, oil, honey, molasses, fish, meat, then milk, curds—<br>
a nun, asking for these for herself,<br>
has fallen into a blameworthy (matter) <br>

<p>Following the straight way <br>
of the training of one under training,</p>
<p>This (right) conduct is the beginning,<br>
