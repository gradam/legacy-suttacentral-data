Of the six origins of offences by how many origins do the offences of a nun
who, filled with desire, … originate? … They originate by one origin: they
originate by body and by mind, not by speech … The offences for one who is
partaking of … curds, having had them asked for, originate by origins: it may
be they originate by body, not by speech, no by mind; it may be they originate
by body and by speech, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.115" href="#BD.6.115"></a>
not by mind; it may be they originate by body and by mind, not by speech; it
may be they originate by body and by speech and by mind.</p>
