… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
several nuns, having spent the rains in a village residence, went to Sāvatthī.
Nuns spoke thus to these nuns: “Where did the ladies spend the rains? We hope
that the exhortation was effective?”</p>
<p>“There were no monks there, ladies; how could the exhortation be effective?”
Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can these nuns spend the rains in a residence where there is no monk?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nuns … where there was no monk?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nuns … where there is no monk? It is not, monks, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should spend the rains in a residence where there is no monk,
there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.56.2.1" href="#Bi-Pc.56.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">A residence where there is no monk</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is not possible to go for exhortation or for communion. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.353" href="#BD.3.353"></a>
If she thinks, “I will spend the rains,” (and) prepares a lodging, provides
drinking water and water for washing, sweeps a cell, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. With sunrise, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.56.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.56.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if monks, having entered on the rains-settlement, come to
have gone away or left the Order or done their time or gone over to (another)
side; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
