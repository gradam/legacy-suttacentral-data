</span> … The nun Thullanandā, saying: “These are ignorant, these are inexperienced,
they do not even know a (formal) act or the defect of a (formal) act or the
failure of a (formal) act or the success of a (formal) act,” and being quick
tempered, she abused a group. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about,

<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … abuse a group? It is not, monks, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, being quick tempered, should abuse a group, there is an offence
of expiation.”</span></p>
