… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
nuns did household work. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:
“How can these nuns do household work?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns do household work?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns do household work? It is not, monks, for pleasing those
who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should do household work, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Household work</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if she cooks conjey or rice or <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.301" href="#Vin.4.301"></a>
solid food for a layman, if she washes a cloak or a turban, there is an offence
of expiation</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.44.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.44.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if it is a drink of conjey, if it is for the Order; if it
is for worship at a shrine; if in doing household work for herself she cooks
conjey or rice or solid food, washes a cloak or a turban; if she is mad, if she
is the first wrong-doer.</p>
