… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a certain monk, going to Sāvatthī through the Kosalan districts, passed by a
certain village-gate. A certain woman, having quarrelled with her husband,
having departed from the village, having seen that monk, spoke thus: “Where,
honoured sir, will the master go?”</p>
<p>“I, sister, will go to Sāvatthī.”</p>
<p>“I will go together with the master.”</p>
<p>“If you wish to, sister,” he said.</p>
<p>Then that woman’s husband, having departed from the village, asked people:
“Have the masters seen such and such a woman?”</p>
<p>“She, master, is going along with one who has gone forth.” Then that man,
having followed after, having seized that monk, having thrashed him, set him
free. Then that monk, incensed, sat down at the foot of a certain tree. Then
that woman spoke thus to that man:</p>
<p>“Master, that monk did not make me come out; but it is I myself who am going
along together with this monk. This monk is innocent; go along, apologise to
him.” Then that man apologised to that monk. Then that monk, having arrived at
Sāvatthī, told this matter to the monks. Those who were modest monks … spread
it about, saying:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.19" href="#BD.3.19"></a>
“How can a monk, having arranged together with a woman, go along the same high
road?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monk, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.133" href="#Vin.4.133"></a>
having arranged together with a woman, went along the same high road?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, having arranged together with a woman, go along the
same high road? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet)
pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, having arranged together with a woman, should go along the same
high road, even among villages, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

If he thinks that it is a woman when it is a woman, (and) having arranged, goes
along the same high road, even among villages, there is an offence of
expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether it is a woman … If he thinks that it
is not a woman when it is a woman … offence of expiation. If the monk arranges
(and) the woman does not arrange, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If,
having arranged, he goes along the same <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.20" href="#BD.3.20"></a>
high road together with a female <i lang="pi">yakkha</i> or a female departed one or with a eunuch or with an animal in the form of a
human woman, even among villages, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he
thinks that it is a woman when it is not a woman, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is not a woman, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not a woman when it is not a
woman there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.67.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.67.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if he goes not having arranged; if the woman arranges (and)
the monk does not arrange; if he goes without (making) a rendezvous; if there
are accidents; if he is mad, if he is the first wrongdoer.</p>
