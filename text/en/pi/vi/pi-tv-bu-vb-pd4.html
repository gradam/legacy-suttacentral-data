… among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan monastery. Now at that time
the slaves of the Sakyans came to be out of hand. Sakyan women wanted to make a
meal in jungle lodgings. The slaves of the Sakyans heard that Sakyan women were
desirous of making a meal in jungle lodgings. They infested the way. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.182" href="#Vin.4.182"></a>
Sakyan women, taking sumptuous solid food, soft food, went off to a jungle
lodging. The slaves of the Sakyans, having issued forth, robbed the Sakyan
women and violated them. The Sakyans, having issued forth, having seized these
thieves together with the goods, looked down upon, criticised, spread it about,
saying:</p>
<p>“How can these revered sirs not announce that thieves are living in the
monastery?” Monks heard the Sakyans who … spread it about … Then these monks
told this matter to the lord. Then the lord on this occasion, in this
connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>On account of this, monks, I will lay down a rule of training founded on ten
reasons: for the excellence of the Order … for following the rules of
restraint. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever are those jungle lodgings that are held to be dangerous, frightening,
whatever monk in such lodgings, not announced beforehand, having accepted solid
food or soft food within a monastery with his own <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.116" href="#BD.3.116"></a>
hand, should eat it or partake of it, it should be confessed by that monk,
saying: ‘I have fallen, your reverences, into a blameworthy matter, unbecoming,
which ought to be confessed; I confess it.’”</span></p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pd.4.2.1" href="#Bu-Pd.4.2.1"></a>
Now at that time a certain monk came to be ill in a jungle lodging. People,
taking solid food or soft food set out for the jungle lodging. Then these
people spoke thus to this monk: “Eat, honoured sir.” Then that monk, thinking:
“It is forbidden by the lord, having accepted in a jungle lodging solid food or
soft food with one’s own hand, to eat it, to partake of it,” being scrupulous,
did not accept it; he was unable to enter for almsfood, he became famished.
Then this monk told this matter to the monks. The monks told this matter to the
lord. Then the lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having given
reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow, monks, an ill monk, having accepted in a jungle lodging solid food or
soft food with his own hand, to eat it, to partake of it. And thus, monks, this
rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever are those jungle lodgings that are held to be dangerous, frightening,
whatever monk in such <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.183" href="#Vin.4.183"></a>
lodgings, not announced beforehand, having accepted solid food or soft food
within a monastery with his own hand, should eat it or partake of it if he is
not ill, it should be confessed by that monk, saying: ‘I have fallen, your
reverences, into a blameworthy matter, unbecoming, which ought to be confessed;
I confess it.’”</span></p>

<p>If it is not announced, if he is not ill (and) accepts it, thinking: “I will
eat, I will partake of,” there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful
there is an offence which ought to be confessed.</p>
<p>If he thinks that it is not announced when it is not announced (and) having
accepted solid food or soft food with his own hand within the monastery when he
is not ill, eats it or partakes of it, there is an offence which ought to be
confessed. If he is in doubt as to whether it is not announced … If he thinks
that it is announced when it is not announced … ought to be confessed. If he

<hr>

<p class="end">The Fourth</p>
<p>Venerable ones, recited are the four rules for offences which ought to be
confessed. Concerning them, I ask the venerable ones: I hope that you are quite
pure in this matter? And a second time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in
this matter? And a third time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this
matter? The venerable ones are quite pure in this matter, therefore they are
silent; thus do I understand this.</p>
<p class="end">Told are the offences which ought to be confessed. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.185" href="#Vin.4.185"></a>
