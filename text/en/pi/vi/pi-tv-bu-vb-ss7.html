… at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Park. At that time a householder, the supporter of the venerable Channa, said to the venerable Channa:</p>
<p>
“Do find out a site for a <i lang="pi">vihāra</i>, honoured sir. I will have a <i lang="pi">vihāra</i> built for the master.”</p>
<p>
Then the venerable Channa, clearing a site for the
<i lang="pi">vihāra</i>, had a tree cut down that was used as a shrine, revered by village, revered by little town, revered by town, revered by the country-side, revered by the kingdom. People became vexed, annoyed, angry, saying: “How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, have a tree cut down that is used as a shrine
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.156" href="#Vin.3.156"></a>
 revered by village … revered by the kingdom? The recluses, sons of the Sakyans, are depriving a one-facultied thing of life.” The monks heard these people who were vexed, annoyed, angry. Those who were modest monks became vexed, annoyed, angry and said:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.267" href="#BD.1.267"></a>
“How can the venerable Channa have a tree cut down that was used as a shrine, revered by village … revered by the kingdom?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, Channa, that you had a tree cut down that was used as a shrine, revered by village … revered by the kingdom?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, have a tree cut down that was used as a shrine, revered by village … revered by the kingdom? For, foolish man, in a tree are people having consciousness as living beings. This is not, foolish man, for the benefit of unbelievers … Thus, monks, this course of training should be set forth: </p>
<p>
If there is a monk building a large <i lang="pi">vihāra</i> for his own advantage, having a benefactor, monks should be brought for marking out a site. A site should be marked out by these monks, not involving destruction, with an open space round it. If a monk should build a large <i lang="pi">vihāra</i> on a site involving destruction, not with an open space round it, or if he should not bring monks to mark out a site, there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.”</p>
