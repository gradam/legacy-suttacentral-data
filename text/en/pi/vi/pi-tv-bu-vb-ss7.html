<h1>Monks’ Suspension 7: Building a dwelling</h1>
</div>
<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.266"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.7.1"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1512"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Park. At that time a householder who was a supporter of Venerable Channa said to him: “Bhante, please find a site for a dwelling, and I will have one built for you.”</p>
<p>Then, while Venerable Channa was clearing a site for the dwelling, he had a tree felled which had served as a shrine and which was revered by village, town, country-side, and kingdom. People grumbled and complained: “How can the Sakyan ascetics have such a tree felled? <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.156"></a>They are hurting life with one faculty.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1513"></a>The monks heard the criticism of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticised … Venerable Channa <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.267"></a> in the same manner. <a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1514"></a> They then informed the Master. He said: “Is it true, Channa, that you had a tree felled, which had served as a shrine and which was revered by village, town, country-side, and kingdom?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked him: “… Foolish man, how could you do such a thing? People perceive trees as living beings. This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2 class="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1515"></a>“When a monk builds a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for himself, he must get monks to approve a site where no harm will be done and which has a space on all sides. If a monk builds a large dwelling on a site where harm will be done and which lacks a space on all sides, or he does not get monks to approve the site, he commits an offence entailing suspension.”</p>

<div class="gloss">
<p>The monk who is building a dwelling should clear a site, then approach the Sangha, put his robe over one shoulder, pay homage at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his haunches with his palms together, and say: <span class="kamma">“Bhante, I wish to build a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for myself. I request the Sangha to inspect the site for the dwelling.”</span> He should make his request a second and a third time. If the whole Sangha is able to inspect the site, they should all go. If the whole Sangha is not able to inspect the site, then those monks there who are experienced and competent—who know where harm will be done and where no harm will be done, and who know what has a space on all sides and what lacks a space on all sides—should be asked and then authorised. “And, monks, they should be authorised in this way. An experienced and competent monk should inform the Sangha:</p>
<div class="kamma">
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1522"></a>‘Bhante, let the Sangha listen to me. Monk so-and-so wishes to build a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for himself. He is requesting the Sangha to inspect the site for the dwelling. If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should authorise monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to inspect the site. This is the motion.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1523"></a>‘Bhante, let the Sangha listen to me. Monk so-and-so wishes to build a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for himself. He is requesting the Sangha to inspect the site for the dwelling. The Sangha is authorising monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to inspect the site. Any monk who agrees to authorising monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to inspect the site for the dwelling should remain silent. Any monk who does not agree should say so.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1524"></a>‘Monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so have been authorised by the Sangha to inspect the site for the dwelling of monk so-and-so. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’</p>
</div>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1525"></a>‘Those authorised monks should go and inspect the site for the dwelling and find out if there will be any harm and if it has a space on all sides. If there will be harm and it lacks a space on all sides, they should say, ‘Do not build here.’ If there will be no harm and it has a space on all sides, they should inform the Sangha: ‘There will be no harm and it has a space on all sides.’ The monk who is building the dwelling should then approach the Sangha, put his robe over one shoulder, pay homage at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his haunches with his palms together, and say: <span class="kamma">‘Bhante, I wish to build a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for myself.
