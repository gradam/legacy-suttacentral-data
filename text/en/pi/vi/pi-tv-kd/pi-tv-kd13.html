At one time the Awakened One, the Lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta
Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the venerable Udāyin came
to have fallen into one offence: the intentional emission of semen, not
concealed. He announced to monks: “I, your reverences, have fallen into one
offence … not concealed. Now what line of conduct should be followed by me?”
They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<h3>Unconcealed <i lang="pi">mānatta</i></h3>
<p>“Well then, monks, let the Order inflict <i lang="pi">mānatta</i> (discipline) for six nights on the monk Udāyin for the one offence … not
concealed.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.13.1.2" href="#Kd.13.1.2"></a>
“And thus, monks, should it be inflicted: Monks, that monk Udāyin, having
approached the Order, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, having
honoured the feet of the senior monks, having sat down on his haunches, having
saluted with joined palms, should speak thus to it: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, I fell into one offence … not concealed. So I, honoured sirs,

“This is a case, monks, where a monk falls into two offences entailing a formal
meeting of the Order, concealed for two months. He knows the one month, he does
not know the other month … he remembers the one month, he does not remember the
other month … he is not doubtful about the one month, he is doubtful about the
other month. He asks the Order for probation for that month on account of the
two offences, concealed for two months, about which he is not doubtful. The
Order grants him probation … not doubtful. As he is doing probation he comes to
be doubtful about the further month also. It occurs to him: ‘I have fallen into
two offences … concealed for two months. I was not doubtful about the one
month, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.58" href="#Vin.2.58"></a>
I was doubtful about the other month … Suppose I were to ask the Order for
probation for a further month also on account of the two offences concealed for
two months?’ He asks the Order … The Order grants him probation for a further
month also on account of the two offences, concealed for two months. Monks,
that monk should do probation for two months from the earlier date.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.13.25.3" href="#Kd.13.25.3"></a>
This is a case, monks, where a monk falls into two offences entailing a formal
meeting of the Order, concealed for two months. One month is knowingly
concealed, the other month is unknowingly concealed … One month is concealed,
he remembering it, the other month is concealed, he not remembering it … One
month is concealed, he being not in doubt (about it), the other month is
concealed, he being in doubt about it. He asks the Order for probation for two
months on account of the two offences concealed for two months. The Order
grants him probation for two months … concealed for two months. As he is under
probation, another monk arrives—one who has heard much … desirous of training.
He speaks thus: ‘Into what, your reverences, has this monk fallen? Why is this
monk under probation?’ They speak <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.76" href="#BD.5.76"></a>
thus: ‘This monk, your reverence, has fallen into two offences entailing a
formal meeting of the Order, concealed for two months. He concealed one month
(although) he was not doubtful (about it), he concealed the other month
(because) he was doubtful (about it). He asked the Order for probation … The
Order granted him probation for two months on account of the two offences,
concealed for two months. This monk, your reverence, has fallen into these,
this monk is doing probation on account of these.’ He speaks thus: ‘The
granting of probation, your reverences, for that month which he concealed
(although) he was not doubtful (about it) is legally valid; because it is
legally valid, it is effective; but the granting of probation, your reverences,
for that month which he concealed because he was doubtful (about it) is not
legally valid; because it is not legally valid, it is not effective. For that
month, your reverences, that monk deserves <i lang="pi">mānatta</i> discipline.’”</p>
<h3>Purifying probation</h3>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.13.26.1" href="#Kd.13.26.1"></a>
Now at that time a certain monk came to have fallen into several offences
entailing a formal meeting of the Order; he did not know about the expiration
of the offences, he did not know about the expiration of the nights … He did
not remember … He was doubtful about the expiration of the offences, he was
doubtful about the expiration of the nights. He announced to monks: “I, your
reverences, fell into several offences entailing a formal meeting of the Order.
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.59" href="#Vin.2.59"></a>
I do not know about the expiration of the offences, I do not know about
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.77" href="#BD.5.77"></a>
the expiration of the nights … I am doubtful about the expiration of the
nights. Now, what line of conduct should be followed by me?” They told this
matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Well then, monks, let the Order grant the purifying probation to this monk on
account of those offences.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.13.26.2" href="#Kd.13.26.2"></a>
And thus, monks, should it be granted: That monk, having approached the Order …
should speak thus to it: ‘I, honoured sirs, have fallen into several offences
entailing a formal meeting of the Order. I do not know about the expiration of
the offences … I am doubtful about the expiration of the nights. So I, honoured
sirs, am asking the Order for the purifying probation on account of these
offences’. And a second time … And a third time it should be asked for. The
Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying: ‘Honoured
sirs, let the Order listen to me. This monk So-and-so has fallen into several
offences … he is doubtful about the expiration of the nights. He is asking the
Order for the purifying probation on account of those offences. If it seems
right to the Order, the Order may grant the monk So-and-so the purifying
probation on account of those offences. This is the motion. Honoured sirs, let
the Order listen to me. This monk So-and-so … The Order is granting the monk
So-and-so the purifying probation on account of those offences. If the granting
to the monk So-and-so of the purifying probation on account of those offences
is pleasing to the venerable ones, they should be silent; he to whom it is not
pleasing should speak: And a second time … And a third time I speak forth this
matter … The purifying probation is granted by the Order to the monk So-and-so
on account of those offences. It is pleasing … Thus do I understand this.’</p>
