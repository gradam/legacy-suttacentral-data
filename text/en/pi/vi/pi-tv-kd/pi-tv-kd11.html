At one time the Awakened One, the Lord was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta
Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time monks who were followers
of Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka and who were themselves makers of strife, makers of
quarrels, makers of disputes, makers of contention, makers of legal questions
in an Order, having approached other monks who were also makers of strife …
makers of legal questions in an Order, spoke thus (to them): “Do not you,
venerable ones, let this one defeat you; argue loud and long, for you are wiser
and more experienced and have heard more and are cleverer than he is, do not be
afraid of him, and we will be on your side.” Because of this, not only did
strifes arise which had not arisen before, but also strifes which had arisen
rolled on to increase and magnitude.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.11.1.2" href="#Kd.11.1.2"></a>
Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticized, spread it about,
saying: “How can these monks who are followers of Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka and who
are themselves makers of strife, makers of quarrels, makers of disputes, makers
of contention, makers of legal questions in an Order, having approached other
monks who are also makers of strife … makers of legal questions in an Order,
speak thus to them: ‘Do not you … and we will be on your side.’ Because of this
… also strifes which had arisen rolled on to increase and magnitude.” Then
these monks told this <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.2" href="#BD.5.2"></a>
matter to the Lord. Then the Lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having
had the Order of monks convened, questioned the monks, saying: “Is it true, as
is said, monks, that monks who are followers of Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.2" href="#Vin.2.2"></a>
are themselves makers of strife … having approached other monks who are also
makers of strife … speak thus to them: ‘Do not you … and we will be on your
side’? And that because of this … strifes which have arisen roll on to increase
and magnitude?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” The Awakened One, the Lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“It is not suitable, monks, it is not becoming in these foolish men, it is not
fitting, it is not worthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it is not to be
done. How, monks, can these foolish men who are themselves makers of strife …
makers of legal questions in an Order, speak thus: ‘Do not you … and we will be
on your side’? And because of this … strifes which have arisen roll on to
increase and magnitude. It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet)
pleased nor for increasing the number of those who are pleased, but, monks, it
is displeasing to those who are not pleased as well as to those who are
pleased, and it causes wavering in some.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.11.1.3" href="#Kd.11.1.3"></a>
Then the Lord, having rebuked these monks, having in many a figure spoken in
dispraise of difficulty in supporting and maintaining oneself, of great
desires, of lack of contentment, of clinging (to the obstructions), of
indolence; having in many a figure spoken in praise of ease in supporting and
maintaining oneself, of desiring little, of contentment, of expunging (evil),
of punctiliousness, of graciousness, of decreasing (the obstructions), of
putting forth energy, having given reasoned talk on what is becoming, on what
is fitting for them, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Well now, monks, let the Order carry out a (formal) act of censure against the
monks who are followers of Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.11.1.4" href="#Kd.11.1.4"></a>
“And thus, monks, should it be carried out; First, the monks who are followers
of Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka should be reproved; having reproved them, they should
be made to <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.3" href="#BD.5.3"></a>
remember; having remembered, they should be accused of an offence; having
accused them of an offence, the Order should be informed by an experienced,
competent monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. These monks who are followers of
Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka and who are themselves makers of strife … makers of legal
questions in an Order, having approached other monks who are also makers of

you … and we will be on your side”. Because of this, not only did strifes arise
which had not arisen before, but also strifes which had arisen rolled on to
increase and magnitude. If it seems right to the Order, the Order may carry out
a (formal) act of censure against the monks who are followers of Paṇḍuka and
Lohitaka. This is the motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. These

Lohitaka. If the carrying out of a (formal) act of censure against the monks
who are followers of Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka is pleasing to the venerable ones,
they should be silent; he to whom it is not pleasing should speak. And a second

Then the Order carried out a (formal) act of guidance for the monk Seyyasaka,
saying: “You should live in dependence.” After the (formal) act of guidance had
been carried out by the Order, he, choosing, associating with, visiting friends
who were lovely (in deed), making them recite, interrogating them, came to be
one who had heard much, one to whom the tradition was handed down; an expert in
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, an expert in discipline, an expert in the headings; experienced, wise,
modest, scrupulous, desirous of the training; he conducted himself properly,
was subdued, and mended his ways; and, having approached monks, he spoke thus:

Now at that time unscrupulous, depraved monks who were followers of Assaji and
Punabbasu were in residence at Kiṭāgiri. They indulged in the following kinds
of bad habits: they planted and caused to be planted small flowering trees;
they watered them and had them watered; they plucked them and had them plucked;
they tied them up into (garlands) and had them tied up; they made garlands and
had them made with a stalk on one side; they made garlands and had them made
with a stalk on both sides; they made and had a branching flower-stalk made;
they made a wreath and had one made; they made a garland worn round the
forehead and had one made; they made and had an ear-ornament made; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.10" href="#Vin.2.10"></a>
they made and had a breast-plate made. These (monks) took or sent garlands
having a stalk on one side to wives of reputable families, to daughters of
reputable families, to girls of reputable families, to daughters-in-law of
reputable families, to female slaves of reputable families. They took or sent
garlands having a stalk on both sides; they took or sent a branching
flower-stalk; they took or sent a wreath … a garland worn round the forehead …
an ear-ornament … a breastplate. These ate from one dish together with wives of
reputable families, with daughters of reputable families, with girls of
reputable families, with daughters-in-law of reputable families, with women
slaves of reputable families; and they drank from the same beaker; they sat
down on the same seat; they shared one couch; they shared one mat; they shared
one coverlet; they shared one mat and coverlet. And they ate at the wrong time;
and they drank intoxicants; and they wore garlands and used perfumes and
cosmetics; they danced and sang and played musical instruments, and they
sported. They danced when she danced; they sang when she danced; they played
musical instruments when she danced; they sported when she <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.15" href="#BD.5.15"></a>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.11.13.2" href="#Kd.11.13.2"></a>
They played on a chequered board for gambling; they played on a draught-board:
they played with imagining such boards in the air; they played a game of
keeping stepping on to diagrams; they played with spillikans … at dice …
tip-cat … brush-hand … with a ball … at blowing through toy pipes made of
leaves … with a toy plough … at turning somersaults … with a toy windmill …
with a toy measure of leaves … with a toy cart … with a toy bow … they played a
game of guessing at letters … a mind-reading game … a game of mimicking
deformities … they trained themselves in elephant lore … horse lore … carriage
lore … archery … swordsmanship … then they ran in front of an elephant … a
horse … a chariot; now they ran backwards, now they ran forwards; and they
whistled and they snapped their fingers and they wrestled and they fought with
fists; and, having spread out their upper robes as a stage, they said to a
dancing-girl: “Dance here, sister”, and they applauded, and they indulged in
various bad habits.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.11.13.3" href="#Kd.11.13.3"></a>
Now at that time a certain monk, having spent the rains among the people of
Kāsī, while going to Sāvatthī so as to see the Lord, arrived at Kiṭāgiri. Then
this monk, dressing early and taking his bowl and robe entered Kiṭāgiri for
almsfood. He was pleasing whether he was approaching or departing, whether he
was looking forward or looking behind, whether he was drawing in or stretching
out (his arm), his eyes were cast down, he was possessed of pleasant
deportment. People, having seen this monk, spoke thus: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.11" href="#Vin.2.11"></a></p>
<p>“Who can this be like an idiot of idiots, like a fool of fools, like a very
supercilious person? Who will go up to him and give him alms? Our masters, the
followers of Assaji and Punabbasu are polite, genial, pleasant of speech,
beaming with smiles, saying: ‘Come, you are welcome’. They are not
supercilious, they are easily accessible, they are the first to speak.
Therefore alms should be given to them.”</p>
<p>A certain lay follower saw that monk walking for almsfood in Kiṭāgiri; seeing
that monk, he went up to him, and having <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.16" href="#BD.5.16"></a>
gone up to him and greeted him, he said: “Honoured sir, are alms obtainable?”</p>
<p>“No, sir, alms are not obtainable.”</p>
<p>“Come, honoured sir, we will go to (my) house.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.11.13.4" href="#Kd.11.13.4"></a>
Then that lay follower, having taken that monk to his house and made him eat,
said:</p>
<p>“Where, honoured sir, will the master go?”</p>
<p>“I will go to Sāvatthī, sir, to see the Lord.”</p>
<p>“Then, honoured sir, in my name salute the Lord’s feet with your head and say:
‘Lord, the residence at Kiṭāgiri has been corrupted. At Kiṭāgiri are residing
unscrupulous, depraved monks who are followers of Assaji and Punabbasu. They
indulge in the following bad habits … they indulge in a variety of bad habits.
Lord, those men who formerly had faith and were believing now have no faith and
are not believing. Those who formerly were channels for gifts to the Order are
now cut off; they neglect the well behaved monks, and the depraved monks stay
on. It were good, Lord, if the Lord would send monks to Kiṭāgiri, so that this
residence at Kiṭāgiri may be settled.’</p>
<p>“Very well, sir,” and that monk having answered the lay follower in assent,
rising from his seat departed for Sāvatthī. Gradually he approached Sāvatthī,
the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery and the Lord; having approached and
greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. Now it is the custom
for Awakened Ones, for Lords to exchange greetings with in-coming monks. So the
Lord said to this monk:</p>
<p>“I hope, monk, that it is going well with you, I hope that you are keeping
going, I hope you have accomplished your journey with little fatigue? And where
do you come from, monk?”</p>
<p>“Things go well, Lord, I am keeping going, Lord, and I, Lord, accomplished my
journey with little fatigue. Now, I, Lord, having spent the rains among the
people of Kāsī, and while coming to Sāvatthī to see the Lord, arrived at
Kiṭāgiri. Then I, Lord, dressing early, and taking my bowl and robe, entered
Kiṭāgiri for almsfood. Then, Lord, a certain lay follower saw me as I was
walking in Kiṭāgiri for almsfood, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.12" href="#Vin.2.12"></a>
and seeing me, he approached, and having approached, he
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.17" href="#BD.5.17"></a>
greeted me and said: ‘Honoured sir, are alms obtainable?’ ‘No, sir, alms are
not obtainable I said. ‘Come, honoured sir, we will go to (my) house he said.
Then, Lord, that lay follower, taking me to his house and feeding me, said:
‘Where, honoured sir, will the master go?’ I said: ‘I will go to Sāvatthī, sir,
to see the Lord.’ Then he said: ‘Then, honoured sir … may be settled’.
Therefore, Lord, do I come.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.11.13.6" href="#Kd.11.13.6"></a>
Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of
monks convened, asked the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks, is it true, as is said, that monks who are followers of Assaji and
Punabbasu, residing in Kiṭāgiri, are unscrupulous and depraved and indulge in
the following bad habits: they plant small flowering trees … indulge in a
variety of bad habits … and those men … and the depraved monks stay on?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.”</p>
<p>The Awakened One, the Lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can these foolish men indulge in bad habits such as these? How can
they plant and cause small flowering trees to be planted, and water them and
have them watered, and pluck them and have them plucked, and how can they tie
them up into (garlands) and have them tied up? How can they make and have
garlands made …? How can they take and send …? How can they eat … drink … sit …
stand … eat … drink … run … dance and sing and play musical instruments and
sport … play … train themselves … run … run round facing …? How can they
whistle and snap their fingers and wrestle and fight with fists, and having
spread out their upper robes as a stage, say to a dancing-girl: ‘Dance here,
sister,’ and applaud and indulge in a variety of bad habits? It is not, monks,
for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …”, and having rebuked them and
given reasoned talk, he addressed Sāriputta and Moggallāna, saying:</p>
<p>“Do you go, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, and having gone to Kiṭāgiri, carry out a
(formal) act of banishment from Kiṭāgiri against those monks who are followers
of Assaji and Punabbasu; these are those who share your cells.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.18" href="#BD.5.18"></a>
“How, Lord, do we carry out a (formal) act of banishment from Kiṭāgiri against
those monks who are followers of Assaji and Punabbasu? These monks are fierce
and rough.”</p>
<p>“Well then, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, go together with many monks.”</p>
<p>“Very well, Lord,” Sāriputta and Moggallāna answered the Lord in assent.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.11.13.7" href="#Kd.11.13.7"></a>
“And thus, monks, should it be carried out. First, the monks who are followers
of Assaji and Punabbasu <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.13" href="#Vin.2.13"></a>
should be reproved; having reproved them, they should be made to remember;
having made them remember, they should be accused of an offence; having accused
them of the offence, the Order should be informed by an experienced, competent
monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. These monks who are followers of

followers of Assaji and Punabbasu should not stay in Kiṭāgiri. When the

conduct themselves properly, they were not subdued, they did not mend their
ways, they did not ask the monks for forgiveness, they abused them, they
reviled them, they offended by following a wrong course through desire, by
following a wrong course through hatred, by following a wrong course through
stupidity, by following a wrong course through fear; and they went away and

Whenever the householder Citta wished to invite an Order or a group or an

Sāriputta’s talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, spoke thus to the monks who were elders: “Honoured sirs, let the elders
consent to come to a meal with me on the morrow.” The monks who were elders
consented by becoming silent.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.11.18.2" href="#Kd.11.18.2"></a>
Then the householder Citta, having understood the consent of the monks who were
elders, rising from his seat, having I greeted the monks who were elders,
keeping his right side towards them, approached the venerable Sudhamma; having
approached, having greeted the venerable Sudhamma, he stood at a respectful
distance. As he was standing at a respectful distance, the householder Citta
spoke thus to the venerable Sudhamma:</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, may master Sudhamma consent to a meal with me on the morrow
together with the elders.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Sudhamma thought: “Formerly, when I the householder Citta
wished to invite an Order or a group or an individual, he did not invite the
Order or the group or the individual without having asked me for permission;
but now he invites monks who are elders without having asked me for permission.
This householder Citta is now corrupted, he is indifferent to me, detached from
me”, and he spoke thus to the householder Citta: “No, householder, I do not
consent.” And a second time … And a third time did the householder Citta speak
thus to the venerable Sudhamma: “Honoured sir, may master Sudhamma consent to a
meal with me on the morrow together with the elders.”</p>
<p>“No, householder, I do not consent.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.24" href="#BD.5.24"></a>
Then the householder Citta thinking: “What can master Sudhamma, either
consenting or not consenting, do to me?” having greeted the venerable Sudhamma,
departed keeping his right side towards him.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.11.18.3" href="#Kd.11.18.3"></a>
Then, towards the end of that night, the householder Citta had sumptuous foods,
solid and soft, prepared for the monks who were elders. Then the venerable
Sudhamma, thinking: “Suppose I were to see what has been prepared on behalf of
the householder Citta for the elders?” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.17" href="#Vin.2.17"></a>
having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, approached the
dwelling of the householder Citta; having approached, he sat down on an
appointed seat. Then the householder Citta approached the venerable Sudhamma;
having approached, having greeted the venerable Sudhamma, he sat down at a
respectful distance. The venerable Sudhamma spoke thus to the householder Citta
as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>
<p>“Truly abundant, householder, is this solid and soft food prepared by you, but
one thing is not here, that is to say sesamum cake.”</p>
<p>“Although, honoured sir, much treasure is to be found in the Awakened One’s
words, just this is mentioned by master Sudhamma, that is to say sesamum cake.
Formerly, honoured sir, some merchants of the Deccan went to an eastern
district for trading and from there they brought back a hen. Then, honoured
sir, that hen mated with a crow and produced a chick. And whenever, honoured
sir, that chick wanted to utter the cry of a crow it uttered a
“cockadoodle-doo” whenever it wanted to utter the cry of a cock it uttered a
“caw”. In the same way, honoured sir, although much treasure is to be found in
the Awakened One’s words, just this is mentioned by master Sudhamma, that is to
say sesamum cake.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.11.18.4" href="#Kd.11.18.4"></a>
“You, householder, are reviling me, you, householder, are abusing me; this is
your residence, householder, I will go away.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, I am not reviling and abusing master Sudhamma; honoured sir, let
master Sudhamma remain in <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.25" href="#BD.5.25"></a>
Macchikāsaṇḍa delightful is the Wild Mango Grove; I will make an effort for
master Sudhamma in respect of the requisites of robes, almsfood, lodgings and
medicines for the sick.” And a second time … And a third time did the venerable
Sudhamma speak thus to the householder Citta: “You, householder, are reviling
me … I will go away.”</p>
<p>“Where, honoured sir, will master Sudhamma go?”</p>
<p>“I, householder, will go to Sāvatthī to see the Lord.”</p>
<p>“Well then, honoured sir, tell the Lord everything that was said by you and
that was said by me. But this, honoured sir, will not be surprising: that
master Sudhamma should come back again to Macchikāsaṇḍa.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.11.18.5" href="#Kd.11.18.5"></a>
Then the venerable Sudhamma, having packed away his lodgings, taking his bowl
and robe, set out for Sāvatthī. In due course he approached Sāvatthī, the Jeta
Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery, the Lord; having approached, having greeted
the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a
respectful distance, the venerable Sudhamma <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.18" href="#Vin.2.18"></a>
told the Lord everything that had been said by himself and that had been said
by the householder Citta. The Awakened One, the Lord rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“It is not suiting, foolish man, it is not becoming, it is not fitting, it is
not worthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it is not to be done. How can
you, foolish man, jeer at the householder Citta, who has faith and is
believing, who is a benefactor, a worker, a supporter of the Order, with a low
thing, and scoff at him with a low thing? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased …” and having rebuked him, having given
reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying: “Well then, monks, let the Order
carry out a (formal) act of reconciliation for the monk Sudhamma, saying: ‘The
householder Citta should be asked to forgive you.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.11.18.6" href="#Kd.11.18.6"></a>
“And thus, monks, should it be carried out: First, the monk Sudhamma should be
reproved, having reproved him, he should <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.26" href="#BD.5.26"></a>
be made to remember, having made him remember, he should be accused of the
offence, having accused him of the offence, the Order should be informed by an
experienced, competent monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This monk Sudhamma jeered at the
householder Citta who has faith and is believing, a benefactor, a worker, a
supporter of the Order, with a low thing, he scoffed at him with a low thing.
If it seems right to the Order, the Order may carry out a (formal) act of
reconciliation for the monk Sudhamma, saying: “The householder Citta should be

a low thing. The Order is carrying out a (formal) act of reconciliation for the
monk Sudhamma, saying: “The householder Citta should be asked to forgive you”.
If the carrying out of the (formal) act of reconciliation for the monk
Sudhamma, saying: “The householder Citta should be asked to forgive you” is
pleasing to the venerable ones, they should be silent; he to whom it is not
pleasing should speak. And a second time I speak forth this matter … And a
third time I speak forth this matter … you should speak. A (formal) act of
reconciliation for the monk Sudhamma, saying: “The householder Citta should be
asked to forgive you” is carried out by the Order. It is pleasing to the Order,

At one time the Awakened One, the Lord was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s

offence, did not want to see the offence. Those who were modest monks looked
down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can the venerable Channa,
having fallen into an offence, not want to see the offence?” Then these monks
told this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord, on this occasion, in this
connection, having had the Order of monks convened, questioned the monks,
saying: “Is it true, as is said, monks, that the monk Channa … did not want to
see the offence?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” The Awakened One, the Lord rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can this foolish man, having fallen into an offence, not want to
see the offence? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased
…” And having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks,

<h2>An act of suspension for not relinquishing a wrong view</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.11.32"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.11.32.1" href="#Kd.11.32.1"></a>
At one time the Awakened One, the Lord was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta
Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a wrong view had arisen to
a monk named Ariṭṭha who had formerly been a vulture-trainer, like this:</p>
<p>“In so far as I understand <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> taught by the Lord, it is that in following those things called
stumbling-blocks by the Lord, there is no stumbling-block at all.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.36" href="#BD.5.36"></a>
Several monks heard: “A wrong view has arisen to the monk named Ariṭṭha who was
formerly a vulture-trainer, like this: ‘In so far as I understand … there is no
stumbling-block at all.’”</p>
<p>Then these monks approached the monk Ariṭṭha who had formerly been a
vulture-trainer, and having approached, they spoke thus to the monk Ariṭṭha who
had formerly been a vulture-trainer:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, reverend Ariṭṭha, that a wrong view has arisen to you,
like this: ‘In so far as I understand … there is no stumbling-block at all’?”</p>
<p>“Undoubtedly, your reverences, as I understand <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> taught by the Lord, it is that in following those things called
stumbling-blocks by the Lord, there is no stumbling-block at all.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.11.32.2" href="#Kd.11.32.2"></a>
“Do not speak thus, reverend Ariṭṭha, do not misrepresent the Lord;
misrepresentation of the Lord is not at all seemly, and the Lord certainly
would not speak thus. Reverend Ariṭṭha, in many a figure are things that are
stumbling-blocks called stumbling-blocks by the Lord, and in following these
there is a veritable stumbling-block. Sense-pleasures are declared by the Lord
to be (things) affording little satisfaction, of much pain, of much
tribulation, where in is more danger. Sense-pleasures are declared by the Lord
to be like a skeleton, of much pain, of much tribulation, wherein is more
danger. Sense-pleasures are declared by the Lord to be like a lump of meat … to
be like a fire-brand of dry grass … to be like a pit of glowing embers … to be
like a dream … to be like something borrowed … to be like the fruits of a tree
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.26" href="#Vin.2.26"></a>
… to be like a slaughter-house … to be like an impaling stake … Sense-pleasures
are declared by the Lord to be like a snake’s head, of much pain, of much
tribulation, wherein is more danger.”</p>
<p>Yet the monk Ariṭṭha who had formerly been a vulture-trainer, on being spoken
to thus by these monks, expressed that wrong view as before, obstinately
holding to it, adhering to it: “Undoubtedly, your reverences, as I understand <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> taught by the Lord, it is that in following those things called
stumbling-blocks by the Lord, there is no stumbling-block at all.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.11.32.3" href="#Kd.11.32.3"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.37" href="#BD.5.37"></a>
And since those monks were unable to dissuade the monk Ariṭṭha who had formerly
been a vulture-trainer from that wrong view, then those monks approached the
Lord; and having approached, they told this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord
on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of monks convened,
questioned the monk Ariṭṭha who had formerly been a vulture-trainer, saying:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that to you, Ariṭṭha, a wrong view like this arose:
‘In so far as I understand <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> … there is no stumbling-block at all’?”</p>
<p>“Undoubtedly, Lord, as I understand <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> … no stumbling-block at all.”</p>
<p>“To whom then do you, foolish man, understand that <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> was taught thus by me? Are not, foolish man, things that are stumbling-blocks
called in many a figure stumbling-blocks by me, and in following these is there
not a veritable stumbling-block? Sense-pleasures are declared by me to be
things affording little satisfaction, of much pain, of much tribulation,
wherein is more danger … Sense-pleasures are declared by me to be like a
snake’s head, of much pain, of much tribulation, wherein is more danger. And
yet you, foolish man, not only misrepresent me because of your own wrong grasp,
but you also injure yourself, and give rise to much demerit which for a long
time will be for you, foolish man, of woe and pain. It is not, foolish man, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …” And having rebuked him, having
given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks saying:</p>
<p>“Well then, monks, let the Order carry out a (formal) act of suspension for not
giving up a wrong view against the monk Ariṭṭha who was formerly a
vulture-trainer, (and with) no eating with an Order.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.11.32.4" href="#Kd.11.32.4"></a>
“And thus, monks, should it be carried out: First, the monk Ariṭṭha should be
reproved, having reproved him he should be made to remember, having made him
remember he should be accused of the offence, having accused him of the
offence, the Order should be informed by an experienced competent monk, saying:
‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. A wrong view has arisen to the monk
Ariṭṭha who was formerly a <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.38" href="#BD.5.38"></a>
vulture-trainer, like this:
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.27" href="#Vin.2.27"></a>
In so far as I understand <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> taught by the Lord … there is no stumbling-block at all. He does not give up
this view. If it seems right to the Order, let the Order carry out a (formal)
act of suspension for not giving up a wrong view against the monk Ariṭṭha who
was formerly a vulture-trainer (and with) no eating with an Order. This is the
motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. A wrong view has arisen … He
does not give up this view. The Order is carrying out a (formal) act of
suspension for not giving up a wrong view against the monk Ariṭṭha who was
formerly a vulture-trainer (and with) no eating with an Order. If the carrying
out of the (formal) act of suspension for not giving up a wrong view against
the monk Ariṭṭha who was formerly a vulture-trainer (and with) no eating with
an Order is pleasing to the venerable ones, let them be silent; he to whom it
is not pleasing should speak. And a second time I speak forth this matter … And
a third time I speak forth this matter … It is pleasing to the Order; therefore
it is silent. Thus do I understand this</span>’. And, monks, proclaim in residence after residence: ‘A (formal) act of
suspension for not giving up a wrong view has been carried out against the monk
Ariṭṭha who was formerly a vulture-trainer (and with) no eating with an
Order.’</p>

Then the Order carried out a (formal) act of suspension for not giving up his
wrong view against the monk Ariṭṭha who was formerly a vulture-trainer, (and
with) no eating with an Order. He, when the (formal) act of suspension for not
giving up his wrong view had been carried out against him by the Order, left
the Order. Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it
about, saying: “How can this monk named Ariṭṭha who was formerly a
vulture-trainer leave the Order when a (formal) act of suspension for not
giving <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.39" href="#BD.5.39"></a>
up a wrong view is earned out against him by the Order?” Then these monks told
this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection,
having had the Order of monks convened, questioned the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the monk Ariṭṭha who was formerly a
vulture-trainer left the Order when a (formal) act of suspension for not giving
up a wrong view was carried out against him by the Order?” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.28" href="#Vin.2.28"></a>
</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” The Awakened One, the Lord rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can this foolish man leave the Order when a (formal) act of
suspension for not giving up a wrong view was carried out against him by the
Order? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …” And
having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks,
saying:</p>
<p>“Well then, monks, let the Order revoke the (formal) act of suspension for not
giving up a wrong view.</p>

Monks who are followers of Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka, <br>
themselves makers of strife,<br>
approached similar ones and incited them to strife, /<br>
And strifes not arisen were born and those arisen expanded.<br>
Modest, well behaved monks looked down upon. The expounder, /<br>
The Awakened One, standing on what is verily <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, <br>
self-developing, foremost of men, conqueror, <br>
enjoined a (formal) act of censure at Sāvatthī. /<br>
And what is carried out not in the presence of, <br>
when there is no interrogation, no acknowledgement,<br>
and what is carried out for no offence, <br>
for one not (leading on to) confession, for one confessed, /<br>
And what is carried out not having reproved, <br>
not having made to remember, not having accused,<br>
and too what is carried out not in the presence of, <br>
not by rule, by an incomplete assembly, / <br>
Again what is carried out when there is no interrogation, <br>
not by rule, by an incomplete assembly,<br>
and too what is carried out not on the acknowledgement, <br>
not by rule, by an incomplete assembly, / <br>
And too what is carried out when there is no offence, <br>
not by rule, by an incomplete assembly, <br>
and also for (an offence) which does not lead on to confession when it is <br>
not by rule and the assembly is incomplete, / <br>
And likewise for one that is confessed, if also <br>
not by rule, by an incomplete assembly,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.29" href="#Vin.2.29"></a>
<br>
and likewise not having reproved him, if also <br>
not by rule, by an incomplete assembly, / <br>
And likewise not having made him remember, <br>
not by rule, by an incomplete assembly, /<br>
and likewise not having accused him, <br>
not by rule, by an incomplete assembly. /<br>
The bright occasions should also be inferred exactly according to the dark
occasions.<br>
And the Order, so desiring, may carry out censure against this one: /<br>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.41" href="#BD.5.41"></a>
The quarrel (-maker), the ignorant, the liver in company with.<br>
The Order may carry out a (formal) act of censure in regard to moral habit, <br>
good habits, against one who has fallen away from right views, /<br>
And against whoever speaks dispraise of the Awakened One, <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, the Order,<br>
and the Order may also carry out a (formal) act of censure against three (kinds
of) monks: / <br>
The one who is a maker of strife, the ignorant one, the one intent on living in
company;<br>
likewise in regard to moral habit, good habits, right views, / <br>
And against whoever speaks dispraise of the Awakened One, <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, the Order.<br>
The one against whom a (formal) act of censure has been carried out <br>
conducting himself properly, thus: / <br>
Ordination, guidance, attendance by a novice,<br>
the one against whom censure has been carried out should do<br>
nothing in regard to exhortation, even although agreed upon. / <br>
He should not fall into that same offence, into a similar one, or into one
higher than it,<br>
and such a one would neither find fault with a (formal) act, <br>
nor with those who carry it out, /<br>
He should not suspend a regular (monk’s) Observance, Invitation,<br>
such a one should not have to do with commands, authority, / <br>
Leave, reproving, making remember and quarrels.<br>
Ordination, guidance, attendance by a novice, /<br>
Exhortation and even if agreed upon: the five qualities are not the end.<br>
If he falls into that same offence and into a similar one and one that is
higher than it, / <br>
And finding fault both with a (formal) act and with those who carry it out:
this is not the end.<br>
Observance, Invitation, commands, authority, / <br>
Leave, reproving too, making remember, quarrelling,
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.42" href="#BD.5.42"></a>
<br>
whoever is bound by these eight qualities, censure is not allayed for him. /<br>
The bright occasions should also be inferred <br>
exactly according to the dark occasions.<br>
And Seyyasaka too, ignorant, full of offences, living in company: /<br>
The Self-Awakened One, great sage, enjoined a (formal) act of guidance.<br>
(Followers of) the two monks, Assaji and Punabbasu, at Kiṭāgiri /<br>
Indulged in a variety of bad habits and were not talked round. <br>
The self-Awakened One, the Conqueror (enjoined) at Sāvatthī (formal) act of
banishment. /<br>
Sudhamma was a resident in Citta’s Macchasanda,<br>
Sudhamma jeered at the lay follower Citta with talk on birth. /<br>
The Truth-finder enjoined a (formal) act of reconciliation.<br>
At Kosambī when the monk Channa, not wanting to see an offence, /
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.30" href="#Vin.2.30"></a>
<br>
The incomparable Conqueror enjoined (the Order) to suspend him for not seeing.
<br>
Channa did not want to make amends for that same offence. / <br>
The leader enjoined a (formal) act of suspension for not making amends for.<br>
The wrong view of Ariṭṭha was founded on ignorance. /<br>
Suspension for not giving up the wrong view was proclaimed by the Conqueror. <br>
A (formal) act of guidance, banishment, likewise reconciliation, /<br>
A (formal) act for not seeing, for not making amends for, and for not giving up
a wrong view. <br>
Frivolity, bad habits, harming, and also a wrong mode of livelihood: /<br>
These are additional cases in the (formal) act of banishment. <br>
Two fives (beginning): non-receiving, dispraise, are two pentads particularly
named, /<br>
These are additional cases in the (formal) act of reconciliation.<br>
And two among the (formal) acts are similar: censure and guidance; /<br>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.43" href="#BD.5.43"></a>
And there are the remaining cases: banishment and reconciliation.<br>
The three (formal) acts of suspension are alike in their division. <br>
What remains in any (formal) act is to understood as in the case of censure. /
