At one time the Awakened One, the Lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta
Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks
carried out (formal) acts of censure and guidance and banishment and
reconciliation and suspension against monks who were not present. Those who
were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How
can this group of six monks carry out (formal) acts of censure … and suspension
against monks who are not present?” Then these monks told this matter to the
Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that these monks carried out (formal) acts of
censure … and suspension against monks who were not present?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” The Awakened One, the Lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“It is not fitting, monks, in these foolish men, it is not becoming, it is not
suitable, it is not worthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it is not to be
done. How, monks, can these foolish men carry out (formal) acts of censure …
and suspension against monks who are not present? It is not monks, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased …” Having rebuked them, having given reasoned
talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, a (formal) act of censure or guidance or banishment or reconciliation or
suspension should not be carried out against monks who are not present. Whoever
should carry one out, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span></p>

<h2>Verdict by memory</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.14.4"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.14.4.1" href="#Kd.14.4.1"></a>
At one time the Awakened One, the Lord, was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo
Grove at the squirrels’ feeding-place. At that time perfection had been
realised by the venerable Dabba the Mallian seven years after his birth. All
that should be attained by a disciple had been fully attained by him; for him
there was nothing further to be done, no increase to (be added <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.98" href="#BD.5.98"></a>
to) that which had been done. Then this reasoning arost in the mind of the
venerable Dabba the Mallian as he was meditating in solitude: “Perfection was
realised by me seven years after my birth. All that should be attained by a
disciple has been fully attained by me; for me there is nothing further to be
done, no increase to (be added to) that which has been done. Now, what service
could I render the Order?” Then it occurred to the venerable Dabba the Mallian:
“Suppose that I were to <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.75" href="#Vin.2.75"></a>
assign lodgings to the Order and issue meals?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.14.4.2" href="#Kd.14.4.2"></a>
Then the venerable Dabba the Mallian, emerging from his meditation in the
evening, approached the Lord, having approached, having greeted the Lord, he
sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting at a respectful distance,
the venerable Dabba the Mallian spoke thus to the Lord: “Now, Lord, as I was
meditating in solitude, this reasoning arose in my mind: ‘… What service could
I render the Order?’ Then, Lord, it occurred to me: ‘Suppose I were to assign
lodgings to the Order and issue the meals?’ I want, Lord, to assign lodgings to
the Order and issue meals.”</p>
<p>“It is good, it is good, Dabba. Well then, do you, Dabba, assign lodgings to
the Order and issue meals.”</p>
<p>“Very well, Lord,” the venerable Dabba the Mallian answered the Lord in assent.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.14.4.3" href="#Kd.14.4.3"></a>
Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk,
addressed the monks, saying: “Well then, monks, let the Order agree upon Dabba
the Mallian as assigner of lodgings and issuer of meals. And thus, monks,
should he be agreed upon: First, Dabba should be asked; having asked him, the
Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. If it seems right to the Order, the
Order may agree upon the venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of lodgings
and issuer of meals. This is the motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to
me. The Order is agreeing upon the venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of
lodgings and issuer of meals. If the agreement upon the venerable Dabba the
Mallian as assigner of lodgings and issuer of meals <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.99" href="#BD.5.99"></a>
is pleasing to the venerable ones, they should be silent; he to whom it is not
pleasing should speak. The venerable Dabba the Mallian is agreed upon by the
Order as assigner of lodgings and issuer of meals. It is pleasing to the Order,
therefore it is silent. Thus do I understand this.</span>’”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.14.4.4" href="#Kd.14.4.4"></a>
And the venerable Dabba the Mallian, (thus) agreed upon, assigned lodgings in
the same place for those monks who belonged to the same company. For those
monks who knew the Suttantas he assigned lodgings in the same place, thinking:
“These will be able to chant over the Suttantas to one another.” For those
monks who were expert in discipline he assigned lodgings in the same place,
thinking: “They will decide upon discipline together.” For those monks who were
talkers on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> he assigned lodgings in the same place, thinking: “They will discuss <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> with one another.” For those monks who were musers he assigned lodgings in the
same place, thinking: “They will not disturb one another.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.76" href="#Vin.2.76"></a>
For those monks who were talkers on inferior matters and who were athletic he
assigned lodgings at the same place, thinking: “These reverend ones will live
according to their pleasure.” For those monks who came in late at night, he,
having attained the condition of heat, assigned lodgings by this light. So much
so, that the monks came in late at night on purpose, thinking: “We will see a
wonder of the psychic potency of the venerable Dabba the Mallian.” And these,
having approached the venerable Dabba the Mallian, spoke thus: “Reverend Dabba,
assign us lodgings.” The venerable Dabba the Mallian spoke thus to them; “Where
do your reverences desire them? Where shall I assign them?’ These (monks) would
quote a distant place on purpose, saying:</p>
<p>“Reverend Dabba, assign us lodgings on the Vultures’ Peak; your reverence,
assign us lodgings on the Robber’s Cliff; your reverence, assign us lodgings on
the slopes of Isigili Hill on the Black Rock; your reverence, assign us
lodgings on the slopes of Vebhāra at Sattapaṇṇi Cave; your reverence, assign us
lodgings in Sītā’s Wood on the slopes of the Snake Pool; your reverence, assign
us lodgings at the Gomaṭa Glen; your reverence, assign us lodgings at the
Tinduka Glen; your reverence, assign us lodgings at the Tapodā Glen; your
reverence, assign us lodgings at the Tapodā Park; your reverence, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.100" href="#BD.5.100"></a>
assign us lodgings at Jīvaka’s Mango Grove; your reverence, assign us lodgings
at Maddakucchi in the deer-park.”</p>
<p>The venerable Dabba the Mallian, having attained the condition of heat, went in
front of these (monks) with his finger glowing, and they by this light went
behind the venerable Dabba the Mallian. The venerable Dabba the Mallian
assigned them lodgings thus: “This is the couch, this the chair, this the
mattress, this the squatting mat, this a privy, that a privy, this the drinking
water, this the water for washing, this the staff, this is (the form of) the
Order’s agreement, this is the time it should be entered upon, this the time it
should be departed from.” The venerable Dabba the Mallian, having assigned
lodgings to these, went back again to the Bamboo Grove.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.14.4.5" href="#Kd.14.4.5"></a>
Now at that time monks who were the followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka were
newly ordained and of little merit; they obtained whatever inferior lodgings
belonged to the Order and inferior meals. At that time people in Rājagaha <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.77" href="#Vin.2.77"></a>
wanted to give the monks who were elders almsfood having a specially good
seasoning, and ghee and oil and dainties. But to the monks who were followers
of Mettiya and Bhummajaka they gave sufficient ordinary food, broken rice
accompanied by sour gruel. These, on returning from alms-gathering after their
meal, asked the monks who were elders: “What did <em>you</em>, your reverences, get at the refectory? What did
<em>you</em>?”</p>
<p>Some elders spoke thus: “There was ghee for us, your reverences, there was oil
for us, there were dainties for us.”</p>
<p>But the monks who were followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka spoke thus: “There
was nothing for us, your reverences, except sufficient ordinary food, broken
rice accompanied by sour gruel.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.14.4.6" href="#Kd.14.4.6"></a>
Now at that time a householder who had nice food gave the Order in continuous
food supply meals consisting of four ingredients. He, with his wife and
children, attended and served in the refectory. They offered boiled rice to
some (monks), <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.101" href="#BD.5.101"></a>
they offered curry to others, they offered oil to others, they offered dainties
to others. Now at that time a meal given by the householder who had nice food
was apportioned for the following day to the monks who were followers of
Mettiya and Bhummajaka. Then the householder who had nice food went to the
monastery on some business or other and approached the venerable Dabba the
Mallian; having approached, having greeted the veherable Dabba the Mallian, he
sat down at a respectful distance. As the householder who had nice food was
sitting down at a respectful distance, the venerable Dabba the Mallian
delighted, rejoiced, roused, gladdened him with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Then when the householder who had nice food had been delighted … gladdened by
the venerable Dabba the Mallian with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, he spoke thus to the venerable Dabba the Mallian: “For whom, honoured sir, is
the meal apportioned for tomorrow in my house?”</p>
<p>“Householder, the meal apportioned in your house for tomorrow is for monks who
are followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka.”</p>
<p>Then the householder who had nice food was sorry and said: “Why should these
depraved monks enjoy themselves in my house?” And having gone to his house he
enjoined a slave-woman, saying: “Having prepared a seat in the porch for those
who come to eat Tomorrow, serve them with broken rice accompanied by sour
gruel.”</p>
<p>“Very well, master,” the woman-slave answered to the householder who had nice
food, in assent.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.14.4.7" href="#Kd.14.4.7"></a>
Then the monks who were followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka said to one
another: “Yesterday, your reverences, a meal was apportioned to us by the
householder who has nice food. Tomorrow the householder who has nice food
attending with his wife and children, will serve us. They will offer boiled
rice to some, they will offer curry to others, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.78" href="#Vin.2.78"></a>
they will offer oil to others, they will offer dainties to others.” These,
because of their happiness, did not sleep that night as much as expected.</p>
<p>Then the monks who were followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka, dressing in the
morning and taking their bowls and robes, approached the dwelling of the
householder who had nice food. That woman-slave saw the monks who were <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.102" href="#BD.5.102"></a>
followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka coming from afar; seeing them, having
prepared a seat in the porch, she said to the monks who were followers of
Mettiya and Bhummajaka: “Sit down, honoured sirs.” Then it occurred to the
monks who were followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka: “But undoubtedly the food
will not be ready as we are made to sit in the porch.” Then the woman-slave
came up with the broken rice accompanied by sour gruel. “Eat, honoured sirs,”
she said.</p>
<p>“But, sister, we are those who enjoy a continuous supply of food.”</p>
<p>“I know that the masters enjoy a continuous supply of food. But only yesterday
I was enjoined by the householder: ‘Having prepared a seat in the porch for
those who come for a meal Tomorrow, serve them with broken rice accompanied by
sour gruel’. Eat, honoured sirs,” she said.</p>
<p>Then the monks who were followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka thought:
“Yesterday, your reverences, the householder who has nice food went to Dabba
the Mallian in the monastery. Doubtless, Dabba the Mallian has set the
householder at variance with us.” These (monks), on account of their distress,
did not eat as much as expected.</p>
<p>Then the monks who were followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka, returning from
alms-gathering after the meal, having arrived at the monastery, having put away
their bowls and robes, sat down outside the gateway of the monastery, squatting
against their outer cloaks, silent, abashed, their shoulders bent, their heads
lowered, brooding, speechless.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.14.4.8" href="#Kd.14.4.8"></a>
Then the nun Mettiyā approached the monks who were followers of Mettiya and
Bhummajaka; having approached, she spoke thus to the monks who were followers
of Mettiya and Bhummajaka: “I salute you, masters.” When she had spoken thus,
the monks who were followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka did not respond. A
second time … A third time the monks who were followers of Mettiya and
Bhummajaka did not respond.</p>
<p>“Do I offend against the masters? Why do the masters not respond to me?” she
said.</p>
<p>“It is because you, sister, neglected us when we were being got into
difficulties by Dabba the Mallian.”</p>
<p>“What can I do, masters?” she said.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.103" href="#BD.5.103"></a>
“If you would like, sister, this very day you could make the Lord expel Dabba
the Mallian.”</p>
<p>“What can I do, masters? How am I able to do that?”</p>
<p>“You come, sister, approach the Lord; having approached, say to the Lord: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.79" href="#Vin.2.79"></a>
‘Now, Lord, it is not proper, it is not becoming that this quarter which should
be without fear, secure, without danger, is the very quarter which is full of
fear, insecure, full of danger. Where there was a calm, now there is a gale. It
seems the very water is blazing. I have been assaulted by master Dabba the
Mallian.’”</p>
<p>“Very well, masters,” and the nun Mettiyā having answered the monks who were
followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka in assent, approached the Lord; having
approached, having greeted the Lord, she stood at a respectful distance. As she
was standing at a respectful distance, the nun Mettiya spoke thus to the Lord:
“Now, Lord, it is not proper … I have been assaulted by master Dabba the
Mallian.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.14.4.9" href="#Kd.14.4.9"></a>
Then the Lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of
monks convened, questioned the venerable Dabba the Mallian, saying:</p>
<p>“Do you, Dabba, remember doing as this nun says?”</p>
<p>“Lord, the Lord knows in regard to me.” And a second time … And a third time …
“Lord, the Lord knows in regard to me.”</p>
<p>“Dabba, the Dabbas do not give evasive answers like that. If what was done was
done by you, say so; if it was not done (by you), say it was not.”</p>
<p>“Since I, Lord, was born, I cannot call to mind ever indulging in sexual
intercourse even in a dream, much less so when I was awake.”</p>
<p>Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: “Well then, monks, expel the nun
Mettiyā, and take these monks to task.” Having spoken thus, the Lord, rising
from his seat, entered a dwelling-place. Then these monks expelled the nun
Mettiyā. Then the monks who were followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka spoke thus
to these monks: “Your reverences, do not expel the nun Mettiyā; in no way has
she offended; she was <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.104" href="#BD.5.104"></a>
urged on by us because we were angry, displeased and wanted him out of the
way.”</p>
<p>“But are not you, your reverences, defaming the venerable Dabba the Mallian
with an unfounded charge of falling away from moral habit?”</p>
<p>“Yes, your reverences.” Those who were modest monks looked down upon,
criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can these monks who are followers of
Mettiya and Bhummajaka defame the venerable Dabba the Mallian with an unfounded
charge of falling away from moral habit?” Then these monks told this matter to
the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the monks who are followers of Mettiya and
Bhummajaka defamed Dabba the Mallian with an unfounded charge of falling away
from moral habit?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he
addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.14.4.10" href="#Kd.14.4.10"></a>
“Well then, monks, let the Order give a verdict of innocence to Dabba the
Mallian who has remembered fully. And thus, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.80" href="#Vin.2.80"></a>
monks, should it be given: Monks, Dabba the Mallian, having approached the
Order, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, having honoured the
feet of the senior monks, having sat down on his haunches, having saluted with
joined palms, should speak thus to it: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, these monks, followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka, defamed me
with an unfounded charge of falling away from moral habit. But I, honoured
sirs, having remembered fully, ask the Order for a verdict of innocence</span>’. And a second time it should be asked for … And a third time it should be
asked for: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, these monks who are followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka defamed
me with an unfounded charge of falling away from moral habit. So I, honoured
sirs, having remembered fully, for a third time ask the Order for a verdict of
innocence</span>’. The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.105" href="#BD.5.105"></a>
to me. These monks who are followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka defamed the
venerable Dabba the Mallian with an unfounded charge of falling away from moral
habit. The venerable Dabba the Mallian, having remembered fully, is asking the
Order for a verdict of innocence. If it seems right to the Order, the Order may
give the venerable Dabba the Mallian, who has remembered fully, a verdict of
innocence. This is the motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. These
monks who are followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka … is asking the Order for a
verdict of innocence. The Order is giving the venerable Dabba the Mallian, who
has remembered fully, a verdict of innocence. If the giving of a verdict of
innocence to the venerable Dabba the Mallian, who has remembered fully, is
pleasing to the venerable ones, they should be silent; he to whom it is not
pleasing should speak. And a second time I speak forth this matter … And a
third time I speak forth this matter … A verdict of innocence is given by the
Order to the venerable Dabba the Mallian, who has remembered fully. It is
pleasing to the Order, therefore it is silent. Thus do I understand this</span>’.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.14.4.11" href="#Kd.14.4.11"></a>
“Monks, there are these five legally valid properties in giving a verdict of
innocence: if the monk is pure and without offences; and if they reproach him;
and if he asks; if the Order gives him a verdict of innocence; if it is by
rule, the assembly being complete. These, monks, are the five legally valid
properties in giving a verdict of innocence.”</p>
<h2>Verdict by former madness</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.14.5"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.14.5.1" href="#Kd.14.5.1"></a>
Now at that time the monk Gagga was mad, out of his mind, and while he was mad,
out of his mind he perpetrated much and spoke in a way that was not worthy of a
recluse. Monks reproved the monk Gagga because of offences done (by him) while
he was mad, out of his mind, saying: “Does the venerable one remember having
fallen into an offence like this?” He spoke thus: “I, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.81" href="#Vin.2.81"></a>
your reverences, was mad, out of my mind; while I was mad, out of my mind, much
was <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.106" href="#BD.5.106"></a>
perpetrated and spoken by me that was not worthy of a recluse. I do not
remember that. That was done by me while I was insane.” Although being spoken
to thus by him, they still reproved him, saying: “Does the venerable one
remember having fallen into an offence like this?” Those who were modest monks
looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can these monks
reprove the monk Gagga because of offences done (by him) when he was mad, out
of his mind, saying: ‘Does the venerable one remember having fallen into an
offence like this?’ and he spoke thus: ‘I, your reverences, was mad, out of my
mind; while I was mad, out of my mind, much was perpetrated and spoken by me
that was not worthy of a recluse. I do not remember that. That was done by me
while I was insane’. And although being spoken to by him thus, they still
reproved him, saying: ‘Does the venerable one remember having fallen into an
offence like this?’” Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:
“Is it true, as is said, monks …?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he
addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Well then, monks, let the Order give a verdict of past insanity to the monk
Gagga who is no longer insane.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.14.5.2" href="#Kd.14.5.2"></a>
“And thus, monks, should it be given: Monks, that monk Gagga, having approached
the Order, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, having honoured
the feet of the senior monks, having sat down on his haunches, having raised
his joined palms in salutation, should speak thus to it: ‘<span class="kamma">I, honoured sirs, was mad, out of my mind; while I was mad, out of my mind, I
perpetrated much and spoke in a way that was not worthy of a recluse. Monks
reproved me because of offences done (by me) while I was mad, out of my mind,
saying: “Does the venerable one remember having fallen into an offence like
this?” So I spoke thus: ‘I, your reverences, was mad, out of my mind. While I
was mad, out of my mind, much was perpetrated and spoken (by me) that was not
worthy of a recluse. I do not remember that. That was done by me while I was
insane’. And even although they were spoken to thus by me, they still reproved
me, saying: “Does <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.107" href="#BD.5.107"></a>
the venerable one remember having fallen into an offence like this?” So I,
honoured sirs, no longer insane, am asking the Order for a verdict of past
insanity,’ And a second time it should be asked for … And a third time it
should be asked for, saying: ‘I, honoured sirs, was mad … even a third time am
I asking the Order for a verdict of past insanity</span>’. The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This monk Gagga was mad, out of his
mind. While he was mad, out of his mind, much was perpetrated and spoken (by
him) that was not worthy of a recluse. Monks reproved the monk Gagga for
offences done (by him) while he was mad, out of his mind, saying: “Does the

do not remember … This was done by me while I was insane.” Even on being spoken
to by him thus, they still reproved him, saying: “Does the venerable one
remember having fallen into an offence like thus?” He, no longer insane, is

“Monks, there are these four kinds of legal questions: legal questions arising
out of disputes, legal questions arising out of censure, legal questions
arising out of offences, legal questions arising out of obligations.</p>
<p>“What is here a legal question arising out of disputes? This is a case, monks,
where monks dispute, saying: ‘It is <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>’ or ‘It is not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>’ or ‘It is discipline’ or ‘It is not discipline’ or ‘It is spoken, uttered by
the Truth-finder’, or ‘It is not spoken, not uttered by the Truth-finder’ or
‘It is practised by the Truth-finder’ or ‘It is not practised by the

by the Truth-finder’ or ‘It is an offence’ or ‘It is not an offence’ or ‘It is
a slight offence’ or ‘It is a serious offence’ or ‘It is an offence that can be
done away with’ or ‘It is an offence that cannot be done away with’ or ‘It is a
bad offence’ or ‘It is not a bad offence.’ Whatever here is strife, quarrel,
contention, dispute, difference of opinion, other opinion, because the common
appellation of heatedness is ‘quarrel,’, this is called a legal question
arising from disputes.</p>
<p>“What is here a legal question arising from censure? In this case, monks, monks
censure a monk for falling away from moral habit or for falling away from good
habits or for falling away from right view or for falling away from a right
mode of livelihood. Whatever here is censure, fault-finding, talking to,
scolding, bickering, inciting, instigating, this is called a legal question
arising from censure.</p>
<p>“What is here a legal question arising from offences? Both
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.118" href="#BD.5.118"></a>
the five classes of offences (yield) legal questions arising from offences, and
the seven classes of offences (yield) legal questions arising from offences.
This is called <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.89" href="#Vin.2.89"></a>
a legal question arising from offences.</p>
<p>“What is here a legal question arising from obligations? Whatever is an Order’s
business and ought to be done (by it): a (formal) act for which leave ought to
be asked, a (formal) act at which a motion is put, a (formal) act at which a
motion is put and followed by one resolution, a (formal) act at which a motion
is put and followed by a resolution made three times. This is called a legal
question arising from obligations.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.14.14.3" href="#Kd.14.14.3"></a>
“What is the source of a legal question arising from disputes? Six sources of
dispute are the source of a legal question arising from disputes: there are
three unskilled sources which are the source of a legal question arising from
disputes as well as three skilled sources which are the source of legal
questions arising from disputes.</p>
<p>“Which are the six sources of dispute which are the source of a legal question
arising from disputes? In this case, a monk becomes angry and bears ill-will.
Monks, whatever monk becomes angry and bears ill-will, he lives without
deference, disrespectful towards the Teacher, and he lives without deference,
disrespectful towards <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, and he lives without deference, disrespectful towards the Order, and he does
not complete the training. Monks, whatever monk lives without deference,
disrespectful towards the Teacher, <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, and the Order and does not complete the training, he causes dispute in an
Order, and that dispute comes to be for the harm of the many-folk, for the lack
of ease of the many-folk, for the lack of the goal for the many-folk, for the
harm and dissatisfaction <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.119" href="#BD.5.119"></a>
of devas and mankind. If you, monks, should perceive a source of dispute like
this among yourselves or among others, you, monks, should strive therein for
the destruction of precisely that evil source of disputes. If you, monks,
should perceive no source of dispute like this among yourselves or among
others, you, monks, should therein follow a course (to stop) there being future
effects of precisely that evil source of disputes. Thus there comes to be
destruction of that evil source of disputes, thus there come to be no future
effects of that evil source of disputes.</p>
<p>“And again, monks, a monk becomes harsh and unmerciful, he becomes envious and
grudging, he becomes crafty and deceitful, he comes to have evil desires and
wrong views, he comes to be infected with worldliness, obstinate, stubborn.
Monks, that monk who lives without deference, disrespectful towards the Teacher
… thus there come to be no future effects of that evil source of disputes.
These six sources of dispute are the source of a legal question arising from
disputes.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.14.14.4" href="#Kd.14.14.4"></a>

Now at that time at Sāvatthī a legal question had arisen thus, had sprung up
thus. Then these monks were displeased with the settlement of the legal
question by the Order at Sāvatthī. They heard it said: “In a certain residence
several elders are staying who have heard much, to whom the tradition has been
handed down, experts in <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, experts in discipline, experts in the headings, learned, experienced, clever,
conscientious, scrupulous, desirous of training; if these elders would settle
this legal question according to rule, according to discipline, according to
the Teacher’s instruction, thus would this <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.132" href="#BD.5.132"></a>
legal question be properly settled.” Then these monks, having gone to that
residence, spoke thus to those elders: “This legal question, honoured sirs,
arose thus, sprang up thus. It were good, honoured sirs, if the elders were to
settle this legal question according to rule, according to discipline,
according to the Teacher’s instruction, so that this legal question might be
properly settled.” Then these elders thought: “Because this legal question was
settled by the Order at Sāvatthī, it was therefore properly settled,’ and they
settled that legal question in the same way. Then these monks were displeased
with the settlement of the legal question by the Order at Sāvatthī, they were
displeased with the settlement of the legal question by the several elders.</p>
<p>They heard it said: “In a certain residence three elders are staying … two
elders are staying … one elder is staying who has heard much, to whom the
tradition has been handed down … desirous of training; if this elder would
settle this legal question according to … the Teacher’s instruction, thus would
this legal question be properly settled.” Then these monks, having gone to that
residence, spoke thus to that elder: “This legal question, honoured sir, arose
thus, sprang up thus. It were good, honoured sir, if the elder were to settle
this legal question according to … the Teacher’s instruction, so that this
legal question might be properly settled.” Then that elder thought: ‘Because
this legal question was settled by the Order at Sāvatthī, because this legal
question was settled by several elders, because this legal question was settled
by three elders, because this legal question was settled by two elders it was
therefore properly settled,’ and he settled that legal question in the same
way. Then these monks, displeased with the settlement of the legal question by
the Order at Sāvatthī, displeased with the settlement of the legal question by
the several elders … by the three elders … by the two elders, displeased with
the settlement of the legal question by the one elder, approached the Lord;
having approached, they told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Monks, this
legal question is done with, it is exhausted, it is settled, it is properly
settled.</p>

“<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, in order to convince these monks, three methods of taking
votes:</span> the secret, the whispering in the ear, the open. And what, monks, is the
secret method of taking votes? The monk who is the distributor of voting
tickets, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.99" href="#Vin.2.99"></a>
having made the tickets different (from one another), having approached each
monk, should speak to him thus: ‘This ticket is for one of such a view, this
ticket is for one of such a view. Take whichever you like.’ When he has taken
it, he should be told: ‘And do not show it to anybody’. If he finds that the
majority profess what is not-<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and thinks (the voting is) wrongly taken (the result) should be rejected. If
he finds that the majority profess <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and thinks (the voting is) rightly taken (the result) should be announced.
This, monks, is the secret (method of) taking votes.</p>
<p>“And what, monks, is the method of taking votes by whispering in the ear? The
monk who is the distributor of voting tickets should speak into the ear of each
monk, saying: ‘This ticket is for one of such a view, this ticket is for one of
such a view. Take whichever you like.’ When he has taken it, he should be told:
‘And do not tell anyone about it.’ If he finds that the majority profess what
is not-<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and thinks (the voting is) wrongly taken (the result) should be rejected. If
he finds that the majority profess <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and thinks (the voting is) rightly taken (the result) should be announced.
This, monks, is the method of taking votes by whispering in the ear.</p>
<p>“And what, monks, is the open method of taking votes? If he finds that those
who profess <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> are in the majority, because of his very confidence he should make them take
openly. This, monks, is the open method of taking votes. These, monks, are the
three methods of taking votes.</p>

“By how many (kinds of) decisions is a legal question arising from censure
agreed upon? A legal question arising <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.134" href="#BD.5.134"></a>
from censure is agreed upon by four (kinds of) decisions: by a verdict in the
presence of, by a verdict of innocence, by a verdict of past insanity, by a
decision for specific depravity. If one says: ‘Can it be that, in respect of a
legal question arising from censure, without having recourse to two (kinds of)
decisions—the verdict of past insanity and the decision for specific
depravity—one may agree upon it by two (kinds of) decisions—the verdict in the
presence of and the verdict of innocence?’ he should be told: ‘It can be.’ It
is like this: This is a case where monks defame a monk with an unfounded charge
of falling away from moral habit. Monks, a verdict of innocence should be given
to that monk who has remembered fully. And thus, monks, should it be given:
That monk, having approached the Order, having arranged his upper robe over one
shoulder, having honoured the feet of the senior monks, having sat down on his
haunches, having saluted with joined palms, should speak thus to it: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, monks defamed me with an unfounded charge of falling away from
moral habit. But I, honoured sirs, having remembered fully, ask the Order for a
verdict of innocence</span>’. And a second time it should be asked for. And a third time it should be
asked for. The Order should be informed by an experienced competent monk,
saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. Monks defamed the monk So-and-so
with an unfounded charge of falling away from moral habit; he, having
remembered fully, is asking the Order for a verdict of innocence. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.100" href="#Vin.2.100"></a>

settled? By a verdict in the presence of and by a verdict of innocence. And
what is here needed for a verdict in the presence of? The presence of the
Order, the presence of rule, the presence of discipline and the presence of the
individuals … <span class="add">
<em>as at</em>
<a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-kd14#Kd.14.14.16">Kd.14.14.16</a></span> … And what is here the presence of the individuals? Whoever quarrels and
whoever he quarrels with, if both come face to face, this is here the presence

“And what is here needed for a verdict of innocence? Whatever is the carrying
out of, the performance of, the undertaking of, the assenting to, the
acceptance of, the non-protesting against a formal act for a verdict of
innocence, that is what is needed here for a verdict of innocence. If, monks, a
legal question is settled thus, and one who carries it out opens it up again,
in opening up there is an offence of expiation. If one who has given his

innocence and the decision for specific depravity—one may agree upon it by two
(kinds of) decisions—the verdict in the presence of and the verdict of past
insanity?’ he should be told: ‘It can be.’ It is like this: This is a case
where a monk becomes mad, out of his mind, and while he was mad, out of his
mind, he perpetrated much and spoke in a way that was not worthy of a recluse.
Monks reprove him because of offences done by him while he was mad, out of his
mind, saying: ‘Does the venerable one remember having fallen into an offence
like this?’ He speaks thus: ‘I, your reverences, was mad, out of my mind; while
I was mad, out of my mind, much was perpetrated and spoken by me that was not
worthy of a recluse. I do not remember that. That was done by me while I was
insane.’ Although being spoken to thus, they still reprove him, saying: ‘Does
the venerable one remember having fallen into an offence like that?’ Monks, a
verdict of past insanity should be given to that monk who is no longer insane.</p>
<p>“And thus, monks, should it be given: Monks, that monk, having approached the

where a monk reproves a monk in the midst of the Order for a serious offence,
saying: ‘Does the venerable one remember having fallen into a serious offence
like this—one involving defeat or bordering on one involving defeat?’ He speaks
thus: ‘I do not remember, your reverence, having fallen into a serious offence
like this—one involving defeat or bordering on one involving defeat.’ Although
denying this, he presses him, saying: ‘Please, venerable one, find out properly
whether you remember having fallen into a serious offence like this—one
involving defeat or bordering on one involving defeat.’ He speaks thus: ‘I,
your reverence, do not remember having fallen into a serious offence like
this—one involving defeat or bordering on one involving defeat. But I, your
reverence, remember having fallen into a trifling offence like this.’ Although
denying this, he presses him, saying: ‘Please, venerable one, find out properly
whether you remember … bordering on one involving defeat’. He speaks thus:
‘Your reverence, unasked I acknowledge having fallen into a trifling offence
like this; how could I, when asked, not acknowledge having fallen into a
serious offence like this—one involving defeat or bordering on one involving
defeat?’ He speaks thus: ‘But, your reverence, unasked you did not acknowledge
having fallen into a trifling offence, so how will you, unasked, acknowledge
having fallen into a serious offence like this—one involving defeat or
bordering on one involving <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.137" href="#BD.5.137"></a>

fallen into a serious offence like this—one involving defeat or bordering on

fallen into a serious offence like this—one involving defeat or bordering on

serious offence like this—one involving defeat or bordering on one involving
defeat—this was said by me in jest, this was said by me in haste.’</p>
<p>“Monks, a (formal) act for the decision of specific depravity should be carried
out against this monk. And thus, monks, should it be carried out. The Order

is like this: This is a case where a monk comes to have fallen into a slight
offence. Monks, that monk, having approached one monk, having arranged his
upper robe over one shoulder, having sat down on his haunches, having stretched
forth his joined palms, should speak thus to him: ‘I, your reverence, fallen
