… at Kosambī in Ghosita’s monastery. Now at that time the venerable Channa
indulged in bad habits. The monks said:</p>
<p>“Reverend Channa, do not do that, it is not allowable.” He did the same
(things) out of disrespect. Those who were modest monks … spread it about,
saying:</p>
<p>“How can the venerable Channa do a disrespectful thing?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Channa, did a disrespectful thing?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, do a disrespectful thing? It is not, foolish man,
for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of
training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">In disrespect there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Disrespect</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there are two (kinds of) disrespect: disrespect for a man and disrespect for <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.</span>
<span class="term">Disrespect for a man</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if being spoken to by one <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.394" href="#BD.2.394"></a>
who is ordained concerning what is laid down, thinking, ‘This one is suspended
or disparaged or blameworthy, his bidding will not come to be done,’ he does a
disrespectful thing, there is an offence of expiation.</span>
<span class="term">Disrespect for dhamma</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if being spoken to by one who is ordained concerning what is laid down,
(saying), ‘How may this be lost or destroyed or disappear? or, he does not wish
to learn this,’ he does a disrespectful thing, there is an offence of
expiation.</span></p>

If he thinks that he is ordained when he is ordained (and) does a disrespectful
thing, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether he is
ordained … If he thinks that he is not ordained when he is ordained … offence
of expiation. If being spoken to by one who is ordained concerning what is not
laid down, thinking, ‘This does not conduce to expunging (evil) nor to
punctiliousness nor to graciousness nor to decreasing (the obstructions) nor to
putting forth energy,’ he does a disrespectful thing, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If being spoken to by one who is not ordained concerning what is
laid down or concerning what is not laid down, thinking, ‘This does not conduce
to expunging (evil) … nor to putting forth energy,’ he does a disrespectful
thing, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.114" href="#Vin.4.114"></a>
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that he is ordained when he is
not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to
whether he is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks
that he is not ordained when he is not ordained, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</p>

There is no offence if he speaks, saying: ‘Thus the version of our teachers is
an interrogation’; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
