At one time the enlightened one, the Lord was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time several monks, friends and associates, entered on the rains in a certain residence in the Kosala country. Then it occurred to these monks: “Now by what means can we, all together, on friendly terms and harmonious, spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of almsfood?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.2" href="#Kd.4.1.2"></a>
Then it occurred to these monks: “If we should neither address one another nor converse, but whoever should return first from the village for almsfood should make ready a seat, should put out water for (washing) the feet, a footstool, a footstand, having washed a refuse-bowl should set it out, should set out drinking water and water for washing.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.3" href="#Kd.4.1.3"></a>
Whoever should return last from the village for almsfood, if there should be the remains of a meal and if he should so desire, he may eat them; but if he does not so desire, he may throw them away where there is but little green grass or he may drop them into water where there are no living creatures, he should put up the seat, he should put away the water for (washing) the feet, the footstool, the footstand, he should put away the refuse-bowl having washed it, he should put away the drinking water and the water for washing, he should sweep the refectory.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.4" href="#Kd.4.1.4"></a>
Whoever should see a vessel for drinking water or a vessel for washing water or a vessel (for water) for rinsing after evacuation, void and empty, should set out (water); if it is impossible for him (to do this) he should set out (water) by signalling with
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.209" href="#BD.4.209"></a>
 his hand, having invited a companion (to help him) by a movement of his hand; but he should not for such a reason break into speech. Thus may we, all together, on friendly terms and harmonious, spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of almsfood.”
</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.5" href="#Kd.4.1.5"></a>
Then these monks neither addressed one another nor conversed. Whoever returned first from the village for almsfood made ready a seat, put out water for (washing) the feet, a foot-stool, a footstand, set out a refuse-bowl having washed it, set out drinking water and water for washing.
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.1.158" href="#Vin.1.158"></a>
 </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.6" href="#Kd.4.1.6"></a>
Whoever returned last from the village for almsfood, if there were the remains of a meal ate them if he so desired; if he did not so desire he threw them away where there was but little green grass or he dropped them into water where there were no living creatures, he put up the seat, he put away the water for (washing) the feet, the footstool, the footstand, he put away the refuse-bowl having washed it, he put away the drinking water and the water for washing, he swept the refectory.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.7" href="#Kd.4.1.7"></a>
Whoever saw a vessel for drinking water or a vessel for washing water or a vessel (for water) for rinsing after evacuation, void and empty, set out water. If it was impossible for him (to do this) he set out water by signalling with his hand, having by a movement of his hand invited a companion (to help him); but not for such a reason did he break into speech.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.8" href="#Kd.4.1.8"></a>
Now it was the custom for monks who had kept the rains to go and see the Lord. Then these monks, having kept the rains, at the end of the three months packed away their lodgings and taking their bowls and robes, set out for Sāvatthī. In due course they approached Sāvatthī, the Jeta Grove,
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.210" href="#BD.4.210"></a>
 Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery and the Lord. Having approached, having greeted the Lord, they sat down at a respectful distance. Now it is the custom for awakened ones, for Lords to exchange friendly greetings with in-coming monks.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.9" href="#Kd.4.1.9"></a>
Then the Lord spoke thus to these monks: “I hope that you were well, monks, I hope that you kept going, I hope that, all together, on friendly terms and harmonious, you passed a comfortable rainy season and did not go short of almsfood?”</p>
<p>“We were well, Lord, we kept going, Lord, and we, Lord, all together, on friendly terms and harmonious, passed a comfortable rainy season and did not go short of almsfood.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.10" href="#Kd.4.1.10"></a>
Now, Truthfinders (sometimes) ask knowing, and knowing (sometimes) do not ask; they ask, knowing the right time (to ask), and they do not ask, knowing the right time (when not to ask). Truthfinders ask about what belongs to the goal, not about what does not belong to the goal; there is bridge-breaking for Truthfinders in whatever does not belong to the goal. In two ways do awakened ones, Lords question monks, either: “Shall we teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>?” or “Shall we lay down a rule of training for disciples?” Then the Lord spoke thus to these monks:</p>
<p>“But in what way did you, monks, all together, on friendly terms and harmonious, spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of almsfood?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.11" href="#Kd.4.1.11"></a>
“In that connection did we, Lord, several friends and associates, enter on the rains in a certain residence in the Kosala country. Then it occurred to us, Lord: ‘Now by what means can we, all together, on friendly terms and harmonious, spend a comfortable rainy season and
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.1.159" href="#Vin.1.159"></a>
 not go short of almsfood?’ Then it occurred to us, Lord: ‘If we should neither address one another … Thus could we, all together, on friendly terms and harmonious, spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of almsfood.’ So we, Lord, neither addressed one another nor conversed. Whoever returned first from the village for almsfood made ready a seat … but not for such a reason did he break into speech. Thus did we, Lord, all together, on friendly terms and
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.211" href="#BD.4.211"></a>
 harmonious, spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of almsfood.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.12" href="#Kd.4.1.12"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: “Indeed, monks, these foolish men, having spent an uncomfortable time, pretend to have spent an equally comfortable time. Indeed, monks, these foolish men, having spent communion like beasts, pretend to have spent an equally comfortable time. Indeed … like sheep, pretend to have spent an equally comfortable time. Indeed … having spent communion in indolence, pretend to have spent an equally comfortable time. How, monks, can these foolish men observe an observance of members of (other) sects: the practice of silence?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.13" href="#Kd.4.1.13"></a>
“It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …” Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>
“
<span class="rule">Monks, an observance of members of other sects, the practice of silence, should not be observed. Whoever should observe it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, monks who have kept the rains to ‘invite’ in regard to three matters: what has been seen or heard or suspected.</span> That will be what is suitable for you in regard to one another, a removal of offences, an aiming at (grasping) the discipline.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.14" href="#Kd.4.1.14"></a>
And thus, monks, should one invite. The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. Today is an Invitation day. If it seems right to the Order, the Order may invite.</span>’ A monk who is an elder, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, having sat down on his haunches, having saluted with joined palms, should speak to it thus:
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.212" href="#BD.4.212"></a>
 ‘<span class="kamma">Your reverences, I invite the Order in respect of what has been seen or heard or suspected. Let the venerable ones speak to me out of compassion, and seeing I will make amends. And a second time … And a third time, your reverences, I invite the Order in respect of what has been seen or heard or suspected. Let the venerable ones speak to me out of compassion, and seeing I will make amends.</span>’ A newly ordained monk, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder … having saluted with joined palms, should speak to it thus: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, I invite the Order <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.1.160" href="#Vin.1.160"></a>
 in respect of what has been seen … And a second time … And a third time … and seeing I will make amends.</span>’”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.4.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.2.1" href="#Kd.4.2.1"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks remained on seats while monks who were elders, sitting down on their haunches, were themselves inviting. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six monks remain on seats while monks who are elders, sitting down on their haunches, are themselves inviting?” Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six monks remained on seats … were themselves inviting?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” The awakened one, the Lord rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can these foolish men remain on seats … are themselves inviting? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …” And having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>
“Monks, you should not remain on seats while monks who are elders, sitting down on their haunches, are themselves inviting. <span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to invite while each and every one is sitting down on his haunches.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.2.2" href="#Kd.4.2.2"></a>
Now at that time a certain elder, feeble with age, thinking: “Until all have invited”, while sitting down on his haunches and waiting, fell down in a faint. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, (each one) to sit down on his haunches during the period until he invites, and having invited, to sit down on a seat.</span>”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.4.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.3.1" href="#Kd.4.3.1"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.213" href="#BD.4.213"></a>
Then it occurred to monks: “Now, how many Invitation (days) are there?” They told this to the Lord. He said: “Monks, there are these two Invitation (days), the fourteenth and the fifteenth. These, monks, are the two Invitation (days).”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.3.2" href="#Kd.4.3.2"></a>
Then it occurred to monks: “Now, how many (formal) acts for the Invitation are there?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Monks, there are these four (formal) acts for the Invitation: a (formal) act for the Invitation (carried out) not by rule and when an assembly is incomplete…
<span class="add">=

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.3.3" href="#Kd.4.3.3"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: “Gather together, monks, the Order will invite.” When he had spoken thus a certain monk spoke thus to the Lord: “There is, Lord, a monk who is ill. He has not come.” He said: “I allow you, monks, to give the Invitation on behalf of a monk who is ill. And thus, monks, should it be given: That ill monk,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.1.161" href="#Vin.1.161"></a>
 having approached one monk, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, having sat down on his haunches, having saluted with joined palms, should speak thus to him: ‘I will give the Invitation, convey the Invitation for me, invite on my behalf.’ If he makes it understood by gesture, if he makes it understood by voice, if he makes it understood by gesture and voice, the Invitation comes to be given. If he does not make it understood by gesture … by gesture and voice, the Invitation does not come to be given.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.3.4" href="#Kd.4.3.4"></a>
If he thus manages this, it is good. If he does not manage it then, monks, that ill monk, having been brought to the midst of the Order on a couch or a chair, should invite. If, monks, it occurs to the monks who are tending the ill one …
<span class="add">= <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-kd2.html#Kd.2.22.2">Kd.2.22.2</a></span> … the ill one should not be moved from (that) place; the Order having gone there may invite,

Now at that time five monks were staying in a certain residence on an Invitation day. Then it occurred to these monks: “It is laid down by the Lord that an Order may invite, but we are (only) five persons. Now, how can we invite?” They told this matter to the Lord.

<p>Now at that time several resident monks, five or more, collected together in a certain residence on an Invitation day. They did not know that the other resident monks had not arrived. Thinking of the rule, thinking of discipline, thinking that they were complete, they invited while they were incomplete. While they were inviting, other resident monks, a larger number, arrived.
