… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then the lord
addressed the monks, saying: “Monks, I want to go into solitary retreat for
three months. I am not to be approached by anyone except the one who brings the
alms-food.”</p>
<p>“Very well, lord,” these monks answered the lord, and accordingly no one here
went up to the lord except the one who brought the alms-food. Now at that time
an agreement was made by the Order at Sāvatthī, saying: “Your reverences, the
lord wishes to go into solitary retreat for three months. The lord should not
be approached by anyone except the one who brings the alms-food. Whoever
approaches the lord should be made to confess an offence of expiation.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Upasena, the son of Vaṅganta, approached the lord together
with his followers, and having approached and greeted the lord, he sat down at
a respectful distance. Now it is the custom for enlightened ones, for lords, to
exchange friendly greetings with in-coming monks. The lord said to the
venerable Upasena, the son of Vaṅganta, as he was sitting at a respectful
distance:</p>
<p>“Upasena, I hope things go well with you, I hope <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.84" href="#BD.2.84"></a>
you are keeping going, I hope you have come here with but little fatigue on the
journey?”</p>
<p>“Lord, things go well with us, lord, we keep ourselves going, we have come here
with but little fatigue on the journey, lord.”</p>
<p>Now at that time the monk who was the fellow- resident of the venerable
Upasena, the son of Vaṅganta, was sitting not far from the lord. Then the lord
said to this monk: “Monk, are rag-robes pleasing to you?”</p>
<p>“Rag-robes are not pleasing to me, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>“Then how is it, monk, that you are one who wears rag-robes?”</p>
<p>“Lord, my preceptor is one who wears rag-robes, therefore am I also one who
wears rag-robes.” Then the lord said to the venerable Upasena, the son of
Vaṅganta:</p>
<p>“And is this crowd agreeable to you, Upasena? How is it that you lead the
crowd, Upasena?”</p>
<p>He said: “Lord, I say to whoever asks me for the
<i lang="pi">upasampadā</i> ordination: ‘Your reverence, I am a jungle-dweller, an almsman, one who wears
rag-robes. If you also will become a jungle-dweller, an almsman, one who wears
rag-robes, then will I confer the <i lang="pi">upasampadā</i> ordination upon you.’ If he promises me, I confer the <i lang="pi">upasampadā</i> ordination, but if he does not promise me I do not confer the <i lang="pi">upasampadā</i> ordination.
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.231" href="#Vin.3.231"></a>
I say to whoever asks me for help: ‘Your reverence, I am a jungle-dweller, an
almsman, one who wears rag-robes. If you also will become a jungle-dweller, an
almsman, one who wears rag-robes, then I will give you help.’ If he promises
me, I give help; but if he does not promise me, I do not give help. Thus do I,
lord, lead the crowd.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.85" href="#BD.2.85"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.15.1.2" href="#Bu-NP.15.1.2"></a>
“Good, Upasena, good; it is good, Upasena, that you lead the crowd. But do you
know, Upasena, of the Order’s agreement at Sāvatthī?”</p>
<p>“Lord, I do not know the Order’s agreement at Sāvatthī.”</p>
<p>“At Sāvatthī, Upasena, an agreement was made by the Order: ‘Your reverences,
the lord wishes to go into solitary retreat for three months. The lord should
not be approached by anyone except the one who brings the alms-food. Whoever
approaches the lord should be made to confess an offence of expiation.’”</p>
<p>“Lord, the Order at Sāvatthī will be well known for its own agreement; we will
not lay down what is not (yet) laid down, nor will we abolish what has been
laid down, but we will dwell in conformity with and according to the rules of
training which have been laid down.”</p>
<p>“That is very good, Upasena; what is not (yet) laid down should not be laid
down, nor should what is laid down be abolished, but one should dwell in
conformity with and according to the rules of training which have been laid
down. Upasena, I allow those monks who are jungle-dwellers, who are almsmen,
who wear rag-robes to come up for the sake of seeing me, if they wish to.”</p>
<p>At that time several monks who came to be standing outside the gateway, said:
“We will make the venerable Upasena, the son of Vaṅganta, confess to an offence
of expiation.” Then the venerable Upasena, the son of Vaṅganta, rising up from
his seat with his followers, greeting the lord, departed keeping his right side
towards him. Then those monks said to the venerable Upasena, the son of
Vaṅganta: “Do you, reverend Upasena, know of the Order’s agreement at
Sāvatthī?”</p>
<p>“But, your reverences, the lord said to me: ‘But do you know of the Order’s
agreement at Sāvatthī? … according to the rules of training which have been
laid <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.86" href="#BD.2.86"></a>
down.’ Your reverences, it is allowed by the lord, who said: ‘Those monks who
are jungle-dwellers, who are almsmen, who wear rag-robes may come up for the
sake of seeing me, if they wish to.’”</p>
<p>Then these monks said: “What the venerable Upasena says is true; what has not
yet been laid down should not be laid down, nor should what has been laid down
be abolished, but one should dwell in conformity with and according to the
rules of training that have been laid down.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.15.1.3" href="#Bu-NP.15.1.3"></a>
Then monks heard: “They say it was allowed by the lord, saying: ‘Those monks
who are jungle-dwellers, who are almsmen, who wear rag-robes may come up for
the sake of seeing me, if they wish to.’” These, longing for a sight of the
lord, discarding their rugs, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.232" href="#Vin.3.232"></a>
took upon themselves the practice of jungle-dwellers, the practice of those who
are almsmen, the practice of those who wear rag-robes. Then the lord as he was
engaged in touring the lodgings together with several monks, saw here and there
discarded rugs, and seeing them, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“How is it, monks, that there are these discarded rugs here and there?”</p>
<p>Then these monks told this matter to the lord. Then <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.87" href="#BD.2.87"></a>
the lord, on that occasion, in that connection, having given reasoned talk,
addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“On account of this, monks, I will lay down a rule of training for monks based
on ten grounds: for the excellence of the Order, for the comfort of the Order …
… And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">When, (with the addition of part of) a rug, (a piece of) cloth to sit upon is
being made for a monk, (a piece) the breadth of the accepted span must be taken
from all round an old rug in order to disfigure it. If a monk should have made
(with the addition of part of) a rug, a new (piece of) cloth to sit upon
without taking (a piece) the breadth of the accepted span from all round an old
rug, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-NP.15.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.15.2.1" href="#Bu-NP.15.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">A (piece of) cloth to sit upon</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is so called if it has a border.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.88" href="#BD.2.88"></a>
<span class="term">A rug</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is made “having spread,” not woven.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Is being made</span> means:
<span class="gloss">making or causing to be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Old rug</span> means:
<span class="gloss">dressed in it once, put on once. (A piece) the breadth of the accepted span
must he taken from all round in order to disfigure it means: cutting a circle
or square so that it may become firm, it should be “spread” in one quarter or
it should be “spread” having been unravelled.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">If a monk … without taking (a piece) the breadth of the accepted span from all
round an old rug</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if without having taken (a piece) the breadth of the accepted span from all
round an old rug, he makes or has made, (with the addition of part of) a rug, a
new (piece of) cloth to sit upon, there is an offence of wrong-doing in the
action; it should be forfeited on acquisition. It should be forfeited to … an
individual. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, this (piece of) cloth to sit upon having been made (with the
addition of part of) a rug, (but) without having taken (a piece) the breadth of
the accepted span from all round an old rug is to be forfeited by me. I forfeit
it to the Order.’</span> …
<span class="kamma">‘… the Order should give back … let the venerable ones give back … I will give
back to the venerable one.’</span></span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.89" href="#BD.2.89"></a>
If what was incompletely executed by himself he has finished by himself, there
is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture … <span class="add">See <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bu-vb-np11#Bu-NP.11.2.2">Bu-NP.11.2.2</a></span> … if he makes it or causes it to be made for another, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</p>
<p>There is no offence if he makes it having taken (a piece) the breadth of the
accepted span from all round an old rug; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.233" href="#Vin.3.233"></a>
if, failing to get it, he makes it having taken a smaller (piece); if, failing
to get it, he makes it not having taken (any portion); if acquiring what was
made for another, he makes use of it; if he makes a canopy or a ground-covering
or a screen-wall or a mattress or a squatting-mat; if he is mad, if he is the
first wrong-doer.</p>
