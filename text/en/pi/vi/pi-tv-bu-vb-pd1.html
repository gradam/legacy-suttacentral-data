At that time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta
Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a certain nun, having
walked for alms in Sāvatthī, having seen a certain monk at the time of going
back, spoke thus: “Come, master, accept alms.”</p>
<p>“Very well, sister,” and he took everything. She, at the approach of
(meal)-time, was not able to walk for alms; she became famished. Then that nun
on the second day … on the third day, having walked for alms in Sāvatthī,
having seen that monk at the time of going back, spoke thus: “Come, master,
accept alms “… she became famished. Then that nun on the fourth day went
trembling along a carriage road. A householder who was a merchant, coming along
in a chariot the opposite way, spoke thus to the nun:</p>
<p>“Get out of the way, lady.” She, turning aside, fell down just there. The
householder who was a merchant apologised to that nun, saying:</p>
<p>“Forgive me, lady, that I was the cause of your fall.”</p>
<p>“I, householder, did not fall because of you, but I am simply very weak.”</p>
<p>“But why, lady, are you very weak?” Then this nun told this matter to the
householder who was a merchant. The householder who was a merchant, having
taken this nun to his house, looked down upon, criticised, spread it about,
saying:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.104" href="#BD.3.104"></a>
“How can these revered sirs accept food from the hand of a nun? Women obtain
things with difficulty.” Monks heard this householder who was a merchant who …
spread it about. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How
can this monk accept food from the hand of a nun?”</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monk, accepted food from the hand of a nun?”
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.176" href="#Vin.4.176"></a>
</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>“Was she a relation of yours, monk, or not a relation?”</p>
<p>“She was not a relation, lord.”</p>
<p>“Foolish man, one who is not a relation does not know what is suitable or what
is unsuitable, or what is right or what is wrong for a woman who is not a
relation. How can you, foolish man, accept food from the hand of a nun who is
not a relation? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet)
pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should eat or partake of solid food or soft food, having accepted
it with his own hand from the hand of a nun who is not a relation (and) who has
entered among the houses, it should be confessed by that monk, saying: ‘I have
fallen, your reverences, into a blameworthy matter, unbecoming, which ought to
be confessed; I confess it.’”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… monk is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">(Nun) who is not a relation</span> means:
<span class="gloss">one who is not related on the mother’s side or on the father’s side back
through seven generations.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Nun</span> means:
<span class="gloss">one ordained by both Orders.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.105" href="#BD.3.105"></a>
<span class="term">Among the houses</span> means:
<span class="gloss">a carriage road, a cul-de-sac, cross-roads, a house.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Solid food</span> means:
<span class="gloss">setting aside the five (kinds of) meals, and (food that may be eaten) during a
watch of the night, during seven days, during life, the rest means solid food.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Soft food</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the five (kinds of) meals: cooked rice, food made with flour, barley-meal,
fish, meat.</span></p>
<p>If he says, “I will eat, I will partake of,” (and) accepts, there is an offence
of wrong-doing; for every mouthful there is an offence which ought to be
confessed.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pd.1.2.2" href="#Bu-Pd.1.2.2"></a>
If he thinks that she is not a relation when she is not a relation, (and)
having accepted with his own hand solid food or soft food from the hand of her
who has entered among the houses, if he eats it or partakes of it, there is an
offence which ought to be confessed. If he is in doubt as to whether she is not
a relation … If he thinks that she is a relation when she is not a relation …
offence which ought to be confessed. If he accepts for the sake of nutriment
(food that may be eaten) during a watch of the night, during seven days, during
life, there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If he accepts solid food or soft food from the hand of
one ordained by one (Order only), thinking, “I will eat, I will partake of,”
there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he thinks that she is not a relation when she is a relation,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.106" href="#BD.3.106"></a>
in doubt as to whether she is a relation, there is an offence of wrong-doing.
If he thinks that she is a relation when, she is a relation, there is no
offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pd.1.2.3" href="#Bu-Pd.1.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she is a relation; if she makes (another) give but does
not (herself) give; if having put it down nearby, she gives; if it is within a
monastery; if it is in the nuns’ quarters; if it is at the sleeping-place of
members of other sects; if it is on the way back; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.177" href="#Vin.4.177"></a>
if, having taken it back from the village, she gives; if, when there is a
reason, she gives (food that may be eaten) during a watch of the night, during
seven days, during life and he makes use of it; if it is from a female
probationer, a female novice; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
