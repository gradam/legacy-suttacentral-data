… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. At that time
monks had a rug made every year. They were intent on begging, intent on
hinting, saying: “Give sheep’s wool, we want sheep’s wool.” People … spread it
about, saying: “How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, have a rug made
every year? How can they be intent on begging, intent on hinting, saying: ‘Give
sheep’s wool, we want sheep’s wool’? For, (although) our children soil and wet
them and they are eaten by rats, our rugs once made last for five or six years.
But these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, have a rug made every year; they are
intent on begging, intent on hinting, saying: ‘Give sheep’s wool, we want
sheep’s wool.’”</p>
<p>Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying: “How can monks have a rug made every year? How can
they be intent on begging, intent on hinting, saying: ‘… we want sheep’s
wool’?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.228" href="#Vin.3.228"></a>
He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, have a rug made every year, that you
are intent on begging, intent on hinting, saying: ‘… we want sheep’s wool’?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can these
foolish men have a rug made every year? How can they be intent on begging,
intent on hinting … ‘… we want sheep’s wool’? It is not, monks, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should
be set forth:</p>
<p>“A new rug which a monk has had made should be <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.80" href="#BD.2.80"></a>
used for six years. If, within the six years, whether he has got rid of or has
not got rid of that (former) rug, he should have a new rug made, there is an
offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-NP.14.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.14.2.1" href="#Bu-NP.14.2.1"></a>
Now at that time a certain monk became ill in Kosambī. Relations sent a
messenger to this monk, saying: “Let the revered sir come, we will nurse
(him).” Monks spoke thus: “Go, your reverence, relations will nurse you.” He
said:</p>
<p>“Your reverences, a rule of training laid down by the lord is that a new rug
which a monk has had made should be used for six years; but I am ill, I am not
able to set out taking a rug, and without a rug there comes to be no comfort
for me. I will not go.”</p>
<p>They told this matter to the lord. Then the lord, on this occasion, in this
connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to give a monk who is ill the agreement as to a rug. And
thus, monks, should it be given: That monk who is ill, approaching the Order,
arranging his upper robe over one shoulder, honouring the feet of the senior
monks, sitting down on his haunches, saluting with joined palms, should speak
thus: <span class="kamma">‘I, honoured sirs, am ill; I am not able to set out taking a rug. Thus I,
honoured sirs, request the Order for the agreement as to a rug.’</span> A second time it should be requested, a third time it should be requested. The
Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This monk so and so is ill. He is
not able to set <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.81" href="#BD.2.81"></a>
out making a rug. He requests the Order for the agreement as to a rug. If it
seems right to the Order, let the Order give this monk so and so the agreement
as to a rug. This is the motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.229" href="#Vin.3.229"></a>
This monk … requests the Order for the agreement as to a rug. The Order gives
to the monk so and so the agreement as to a rug. If the giving to the monk so
and so of the agreement as to a rug is pleasing to the venerable ones, let them
be silent; if it does not seem right, they should speak. Agreement as to a rug
is given by the Order to the monk so and so; it is pleasing … So do I
understand this.’</span> And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">A new rug which a monk has had made should last for six years. If, within the
six years, whether he has got rid of or has not got rid of that (former) rug,
he should have a new rug made, except on the agreement of the monks, there is
an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.14.3.1" href="#Bu-NP.14.3.1"></a>
<span class="term">New</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… not woven.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Has had made</span> means:
<span class="gloss">making or causing to be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should be used for six years</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it should be used for six years at the minimum.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">If within six years</span> means:
<span class="gloss">in less than six years.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Getting rid of … that (former) rug</span> means:
<span class="gloss">giving it to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Not getting rid of</span> means:
<span class="gloss">not giving it to anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Except on the agreement of the monks</span> means:
<span class="gloss">setting aside the agreement of the monks, if he makes or causes another new rug
to be made, there is an offence of wrong-doing in the action. It is to be
forfeited on acquisition. It should be forfeited to the Order, or to a group,
or to an individual. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, this rug, which I had made for me less than six years ago
without the agreement of the monks, is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to the
Order.’</span> …
<span class="kamma">‘… should give back … let the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.82" href="#BD.2.82"></a>
venerable ones give back … I will give back this rug to the venerable one.’</span></span></p>
<p>If what was incompletely executed by himself, he has finished by himself, there
is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture … if he makes others finish
what was incompletely executed by others, there is an offence of expiation
involving forfeiture.</p>
<p>There is no offence if he makes one after six years; if he makes one after more
than six years; if he makes it or causes it to be made for another; if,
acquiring what was made for another, he makes use of it; if he makes a canopy
or a ground-covering or a screen-wall or a mattress or a squatting-mat; if
there is the agreement of the monks; if he is mad, if he is the first
wrong-doer. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.230" href="#Vin.3.230"></a>
