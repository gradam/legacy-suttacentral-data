… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
several nuns bathed naked with prostitutes at the same ford of the river
Aciravatī. The prostitutes made fun of the nuns, saying: “Why in the world,
ladies, is the Brahma-life led by you when you are young? Surely the pleasures
of the senses should be enjoyed. When you are old, then you can lead the
Brahma-life; thus will both extremes be experienced by you.” The nuns, being
made fun of by these prostitutes, became ashamed. Then these nuns, having gone
to a dwelling, told this matter to the nuns. The nuns told this matter to the
monks. The monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord on this occasion,
in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Because of this, monks, I will lay down a rule of training for nuns founded on
ten reasons: for the excellence of the Order … for following the discipline.
And thus, monks, the nuns should set forth this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should bathe naked, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.284" href="#BD.3.284"></a>
<span class="term">Should bathe naked</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if she bathes not clothed, not dressed, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.21.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.21.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if she is one whose robe is stolen or if she is one whose
robe is destroyed; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first
wrong-doer.</p>
