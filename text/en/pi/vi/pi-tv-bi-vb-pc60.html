… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a certain nun together with a man, the one with the other, made a boil burst
that had formed on the lower part of her body. Then that man began to violate
that nun. She cried out in distress. Nuns, having run up, spoke thus to that
nun: “Why do you, lady, cry out in distress?” Then that nun told this matter to
the nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can this
nun together with a man, the one with the other, make a boil burst that had
formed on the lower part of her body?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that a nun … lower part of her body?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can a nun … lower part of her body? It is not, monks, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, without having obtained permission from an Order or from a group,
should together with a man, the one with the other, make a boil or a scab that
has formed on the lower part of her body burst or break or let it be washed or
smeared or bound up or unbound, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p>If she commands, saying: “Burst it,” there is an offence of wrong-doing. When
it is burst, there is an offence of expiation. If she commands, saying: “Break
it … wash it … smear it … bind it up <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.317" href="#Vin.4.317"></a>
… unbind it,” there is an offence of wrong-doing. When it is broken … washed …
smeared … bound up … unbound, there is an offence of expiation.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.60.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.60.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if, having obtained permission, she causes it to be burst
or broken … or unbound; if some learned man (is there) as companion; if she is
mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
