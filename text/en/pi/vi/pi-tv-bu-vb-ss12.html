… at Kosambī in Ghosita’s park. At that time the venerable Channa indulged in
bad habits. The monks said: “Reverend Channa, do not do that, it is not
suitable.”</p>
<p>He said: “What do you, your reverences, think should be said to me? It is I who
should tell you. The enlightened one is for us, <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> is for us, <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> is realised for us by a master. Just as a great wind blowing would raise up
grass, sticks, ferns and rubbish together; or just as a mountain-born river
would raise up various water plants together, so you, having gone forth from
various names, from various clans, from various lineages, from various
families, are raised up together. What do you, your reverences, think should be
said to me? It is I who should tell you. The enlightened one is for us, <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> is for us, <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> is realised for us by a master.”</p>
<p>Then those who were modest monks were … angry, and said: “How can the venerable
Channa, himself <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.310" href="#BD.1.310"></a>
being spoken to by the monks in accordance with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, reckon himself as one not to be spoken to?”</p>
<p>Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as they say, Channa, that you, yourself being spoken to by the
monks in accordance with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, reckon yourself as one not to be spoken to?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, yourself being spoken to by the monks in accordance
with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, reckon yourself as one not to be spoken to? It is not, foolish man,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.178" href="#Vin.3.178"></a>
for the benefit of unbelievers … Thus, monks, this course of training should be
set forth:</p>
<p>If a monk is one who is difficult to speak to, and if himself being spoken to
by the monks according to dhamma concerning the courses of training included in
the exposition, he reckons himself as one not to be spoken to, saying: ‘Do not
say anything to me, venerable ones, either good or bad, and I will not say
anything to the venerable ones, either good or bad; refrain, venerable ones,
from speaking to me (then) that monk should be spoken to thus by the monks: ‘Do
not, venerable one, reckon yourself as one not to be spoken to; let the
venerable one reckon himself as one to be spoken to; let the venerable one
speak to the monks in accordance with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, and then the monks will
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.311" href="#BD.1.311"></a>
speak to the venerable one in accordance with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Thus is the multitude increased for the lord, that is to say by speaking with
one another, by assisting one another. And if that monk when he has been spoken
to by the monks should persist as before, then that monk should be admonished
up to three times by the monks together for giving up his course. And if after
being admonished up to three times by the monks together, he gives up his
course, that is good; if he does not give it up, there is an offence entailing
a formal meeting of the Order.”</p>

<span class="term">If a monk is one who is difficult to speak</span> to means:

<span class="gloss">that monk who is difficult to speak to.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">By the monks</span> means:
<span class="gloss">by other monks, these see, these hear. He should be spoken to by these, saying:
<span class="kamma">“Venerable one, do not reckon yourself as one not to be spoken to, let the
venerable one reckon himself as one to be spoken to, let the venerable one
speak to the monks in accordance with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, and then the monks will speak to the venerable one in accordance with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Thus is the multitude increased for the lord, that is to say by speaking to
one another, by assisting one another.” A second time he should be spoken to …
A third time he should be spoken to …</span> If
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.179" href="#Vin.3.179"></a>
he gives it up, that is good; but if he does not give it up, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If, having heard, they do not speak, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. That monk, having been pulled into the middle of the
assembly, should be told: <span class="kamma">“Do not, venerable one, reckon yourself as one not to be spoken to … by
ordaining one another.” A second time he should be told … A third time he
should be told …</span> If he gives it up, that is good; if he does not give it up, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. That monk should be admonished. And thus, monks, should
he be admonished. The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent
monk: <span class="kamma">“Honoured sirs, let the Order hear me. This monk, so and so, being remonstrated
with by the monks in accordance with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, reckons himself as one not to be spoken to: he does not give up this course.
If it is the right time for the Order, let the Order admonish this monk so that
he may give up this course. That is the motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order
hear me. This monk, so and so … Thus do I understand.”</span></span></p>
<p>According to the motion there is an offence of wrong-doing; according to the
two resolutions there are grave offences; at the end of a resolution there is
an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order. If he is com <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.313" href="#BD.1.313"></a>
mitting an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order, the offence of
wrong-doing according to the motion and the grave offences according to the two
resolutions, subside.</p>
<p><span class="term">An offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… on account of this it is called an offence entailing a formal meeting of the
Order.</span></p>

Thinking a legally valid act to be a legally valid act, he does not give it up,
there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order. Being in doubt as
to whether it is a legally valid act … Not thinking an act that is legally
valid to be an act that is not legally valid is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>

There is no offence if he has not been admonished, if he gives it up, if he is
mad, if he is a beginner.</p>
