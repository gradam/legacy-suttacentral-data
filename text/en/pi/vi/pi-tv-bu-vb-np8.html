… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. At that time a
certain man said to his wife: “I will present master Upananda with a robe.” A
certain monk who was going for alms heard the words of this man as he was
speaking. Then this monk approached the venerable Upananda, the son of the
Sakyans, and having approached he said to the venerable Upananda, the son of
the Sakyans:</p>
<p>“You, reverend Upananda, are of great merit; on a certain occasion a certain
man said to his wife: ‘I will present master Upananda with a robe.’”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, he is my supporter,” he said.</p>
<p>Then the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, approached this man, and
having approached he said to this man:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, sir, desire to present me with a robe?”</p>
<p>“Did I not also think, master: I will present master Upananda with a robe?”</p>
<p>“If you, sir, desire to present me with a robe, present me with a robe like
this. What shall I do with one presented that I cannot make use of?”</p>
<p>Then that man … spread it about, saying: “These recluses, sons of the Sakyans,
have great desires, they are not contented. It is not easy to present them with
a robe. How can master Upananda, before being invited by me, approaching me,
put forward a consideration with regard to a robe?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.54" href="#BD.2.54"></a>
Monks heard that man who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying: “How can the venerable Upananda, the son of the
Sakyans, before being invited, approaching a householder, put forward a
consideration with regard to a robe?” Then these monks told this matter to the
lord. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.216" href="#Vin.3.216"></a>
He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Upananda, before being invited, approaching
a householder, put forward a consideration with regard to a robe?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>“Is he a relation of yours, Upananda, or not a relation?”</p>
<p>“He is not a relation, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>“Foolish man, one who is not a relation does not know what is suitable or what
is unsuitable, or what is right or what is wrong for one who is not a relation.
Thus you, foolish man, before being invited, approaching a householder who is
not a relation, will put forward a consideration with regard to a robe. It is
not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus,
monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">In case a robe-fund comes to be laid by for a monk by a man or a woman
householder who is not a relation (of his), thinking: ‘I will present the monk
so and so with a robe, having got the robe in exchange for this robe-fund’—then
if that monk, out of desire for something fine, approaching before being
invited, should put forward a consideration with regard to a robe, saying:
‘Indeed it would be well; do let the venerable one, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.55" href="#BD.2.55"></a>
having got a robe like this or like that in exchange for this robe-fund,
present it to me,’ there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>

<span class="gloss">wanting what is good, wanting what is costly.</span></p>
<p>If according to what he says, he gets in exchange one that is long or wide or
rough or soft, there is an offence of wrong-doing in the action. It is to be
forfeited on acquisition; it should be forfeited to the Order, or to a group,
or to an individual. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: ‘Honoured sirs,
before I was invited (to take) this robe, approaching a householder who was not
a relation, I put forward a consideration with regard to a robe; it is to be
forfeited. I forfeit it to the Order.’ … ‘… the Order should give back … let
the venerable ones give back … I will give back this robe to the venerable
one.’</p>

If he thinks that a man is not a relation when he is not a relation, (and)
before being invited, approaching a householder, puts forward a consideration
regarding a robe, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he
is in doubt as to whether the man is not a relation, (and) before being
invited, approaching a householder, puts forward a consideration with regard to
a robe, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks
that a man is a relation when he is not a relation, (and) before being invited,
approaching a householder, puts forward a consideration with regard to a robe,
there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that a man
is not a relation when he is a relation, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If
he is in doubt as to whether a man is a relation, there <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.57" href="#BD.2.57"></a>
is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that a man is a relation when he is
a relation, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.8.2.3" href="#Bu-NP.8.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if they belong to relations, if they are invited; if it is
for another; if it is by means of his own property; if he gets something of
small value in exchange while he desires to get something costly in exchange;
if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
