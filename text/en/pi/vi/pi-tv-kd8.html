<h2>The story of Jīvaka</h2>

<a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.8.1"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.1" href="#Kd.8.1.1"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.379" href="#BD.4.379"></a>
At one time the awakened one, the Lord was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo
Grove at the squirrels’ feeling-place. Now at that time Vesālī was prosperous
and flourishing, full of folk, thronged with people, and it was well off for
food; and there were seven thousand seven hundred and seven long houses, and
seven thousand seven hundred and seven gabled buildings, and seven thousand
seven hundred and seven parks, and seven thousand seven hundred and seven
lotus-tanks. There was the courtesan Ambapālī, beautiful, good to look upon,
charming, she was possessed of the utmost beauty of complexion, was clever at
dancing and singing and lute-playing, much visited by desirous people and she
went for a night for fifty, and through her Vesālī shone forth all the more.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.2" href="#Kd.8.1.2"></a>
Then the urban council of Rājagaha went to Vesālī on some business. The urban
council of Rājagaha saw that Vesālī was prosperous and flourishing, full of
folk, thronged with people, and well off for food; and (they saw) the seven
thousand seven hundred and seven long houses … seven thousand seven hundred and
seven lotus-tanks, and Ambapālī, the courtesan, beautiful, good to look upon,
charming … and (they saw) that through her Vesālī shone forth all the more.
Then the urban council of Rājagaha, having transacted that business in Vesālī,
came back again to Rājagaha; they approached King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha;
having approached they spoke thus to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha:</p>
<p>“Sire, Vesālī is prosperous and flourishing … and through her Vesālī shines
forth all the more. It were good, sire, if we too might establish a courtesan.”
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.380" href="#BD.4.380"></a>
“Well now, good sirs, do find such a girl as you might establish as a
courtesan.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.3" href="#Kd.8.1.3"></a>
Now at that time there was in Rājagaha a girl called Sālavatī, who was
beautiful, good to look upon, charming, she was possessed of the utmost beauty
of complexion. Then the urban council of Rājagaha established the girl,
Sālavatī, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.269" href="#Vin.1.269"></a>
as courtesan. And the courtesan Sālavatī soon came to be clever at dancing and
singing and lute-playing; she was much visited by desirous people, and she went
for a night for the fee of a hundred. Then the courtesan Sālavatī soon became
pregnant. Then it occurred to the courtesan Sālavatī: “Men do not like a
pregnant woman. If anyone should find out concerning me that ‘The courtesan
Sālavatī is pregnant’, all respect for me would dwindle. What now if I should
make it known that I am ill?”</p>
<p>Then the courtesan Sālavatī enjoined the door-keeper, saying: “Good
door-keeper, do not let any man come in, and if anyone asks for me, make it
known that I am ill.”</p>
<p>“Very well, lady,” that door-keeper answered the courtesan Sālavatī in assent.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.4" href="#Kd.8.1.4"></a>
Then the courtesan Sālavatī when (the child of) her womb was mature, gave birth
to a son. Then the courtesan Sālavatī enjoined a slave-woman, saying: “Now
then, come along, having put this boy into a winnowing-basket, having taken him
out, throw him away on a rubbish-heap.”</p>
<p>“Very well, lady,” and that slave-woman having answered the courtesan Sālavatī
in assent, having put that boy into a winnowing-basket, having taken him out,
threw him away on a rubbish-heap.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time the king’s son, Abhaya by name, going in the morning to the
royal audience, saw that boy surrounded <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.381" href="#BD.4.381"></a>
by crows; seeing this, he asked the people: “Good sirs, what is this that is
surrounded by crows?”</p>
<p>“It is a boy, sire.”</p>
<p>“Is he alive, good sirs?”</p>
<p>“He is alive, sire.”</p>
<p>“Well now, good sirs, having brought that boy to our women’s quarters, give him
to foster-mothers to care for.”</p>
<p>“Very well, sire,” and these people having answered Abhaya, the king’s son, in
assent, having brought that boy to the women’s quarters of Abhaya, the king’s
son, gave him to foster-mothers saying, “Care for him”.</p>
<p>Because it was said of him, “He is alive”, they gave him the name of Jīvaka;
because the prince caused him to be cared for, they gave him the name of
Komārabhacca.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.5" href="#Kd.8.1.5"></a>
And before long Jīvaka Komārabhacca attained to years of discretion. Then
Jīvaka Komārabhacca approached Abhaya, the king’s son, and having approached he
spoke thus to Abhaya, the king’s son:</p>
<p>“Who, sire, is my mother? Who my father?”</p>
<p>“Not even I, good Jīvaka, know your mother, but I am your father, for I had you
cared for.”</p>
<p>Then it occurred to Jīvaka Komārabhacca:</p>
<p>“Without a craft, it is not easy to depend upon these royal families. Suppose I
were to learn a craft?” Now at that time there lived a world-famed doctor at
Taxilā.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.6" href="#Kd.8.1.6"></a>
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, without having asked (permission) of Abhaya, the
king’s son, set out for Taxilā; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.270" href="#Vin.1.270"></a>
in course of time he arrived at Taxilā and that doctor; having approached, he
spoke thus to that doctor:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.382" href="#BD.4.382"></a>
“I want, teacher, to train in the craft.”</p>
<p>“Well then, good Jīvaka, train in it.”</p>
<p>Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca learnt much and learnt it quickly, and he reflected
upon it well, and he did not forget what he had learnt. Then at the end of
seven years, it occurred to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: “I am learning much and
learning it quickly, and I am reflecting upon it well, and I do not forget what
I have learnt, but after studying for seven years the end of this craft is not
visible to me. When will the end of this craft be visible?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.7" href="#Kd.8.1.7"></a>
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca approached that doctor; having approached he spoke
thus to that doctor:</p>
<p>“I, teacher, am learning much and learning it quickly, and I am reflecting upon
it well, and I do not forget what I have learnt, but after studying for seven
years the end of this craft is not visible to me. When will the end of this
craft be visible?”</p>
<p>“Well now, good Jīvaka, taking a spade, touring a <i lang="pi">yojana</i> all round Taxilā, bring whatever you should see that is not medicinal.”</p>
<p>“Very well, teacher,” and Jīvaka Komārabhacca having answered that doctor in
assent, taking a spade, touring a <i lang="pi">yojana</i> all round Taxilā, did not see anything that was not medicinal. Then Jīvaka
Komārabhacca approached that doctor; having approached he spoke thus to that
doctor:</p>
<p>“Teacher, while I was touring for a <i lang="pi">yojana</i> all round Taxilā, I did not see any thing that was not medicinal.”</p>
<p>“You are trained, good Jīvaka, this much is enough for a livelihood for you,”
and he gave him trifling provisions for the journey.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.8" href="#Kd.8.1.8"></a>
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, taking those trifling provisions for the journey, set
out for Rājagaha. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca’s trifling provisions for the
journey became used up on the way, at Sāketa. Then it occurred to Jīvaka
Komārabhacca:</p>
<p>“These wilderness roads have little water, little food; it is not easy to go
along them without provisions for the journey. Suppose I were to look about for
provisions for the journey?”</p>
<h2>The story of the merchant’s wife</h2>
<p>Now at that time in Sāketa a merchant’s wife had had a <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.383" href="#BD.4.383"></a>
disease of the head for seven years. Many very great, world-famed doctors who
had come had not been able to cure her; taking much gold, they went away. Then
Jīvaka Komārabhacca, entering Sāketa, asked the people: “Who, good sirs, is
ill? Whom shall I attend?”</p>
<p>“Teacher, this merchant’s wife <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.271" href="#Vin.1.271"></a>
has had a disease of the head for seven years; go, teacher, attend this
merchant’s wife.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.9" href="#Kd.8.1.9"></a>
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca went up to the dwelling of that householder, the
merchant, and having gone up, he enjoined the door-keeper, saying: “Go, good
door-keeper, say to the merchant’s wife, ‘Lady, a doctor is come who wants to
see you’”.</p>
<p>“Very well, teacher,” and that door-keeper having answered Jīvaka Komārabhacca
in assent, approached that merchant’s wife; having approached, he spoke thus to
that merchant’s wife: “Lady, a doctor is come who wants to see you.”</p>
<p>“What sort of a doctor is he, good door-keeper?”</p>
<p>“He is young, lady.”</p>
<p>“That’s enough, good door-keeper. What could a young doctor do for me? Many
very great, world-famed doctors who have come have not been able to cure me;
they have gone away taking much gold.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.10" href="#Kd.8.1.10"></a>
Then that door-keeper went up to Jīvaka Komārabhacca; having gone up, he spoke
thus to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: “Teacher, the merchant’s wife speaks thus: ‘That’s
enough, good door-keeper … taking much gold’.”</p>
<p>“Go, good door-keeper, say to the merchant’s wife: ‘Lady, the doctor speaks
thus: Do not, lady, give anything beforehand; when you become well, then you
may give what you like’.”</p>
<p>“Very well, teacher,” and that door-keeper having answered Jīvaka Komārabhacca
in assent, went up to that merchant’s wife; having gone up, he spoke thus to
that merchant’s wife: “Lady, the doctor speaks thus … ‘… then you may give what
you like’.”</p>
<p>“Well then, good door-keeper, let the doctor come.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.384" href="#BD.4.384"></a>
“Very well, lady,” and that door-keeper having answered the merchant’s wife in
assent, went up to Jīvaka Komārabhacca; having gone up, he spoke thus to Jīvaka
Komārabhacca:</p>
<p>“The merchant’s wife, teacher, summons you.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.11" href="#Kd.8.1.11"></a>
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca went up to that merchant’s wife; having gone up,
having observed her uneasiness, he spoke thus to the merchant’s wife:</p>
<p>“Lady, a handful of ghee is wanted.”</p>
<p>Then that merchant’s wife had a handful of ghee given to Jīvaka Komārabhacca.
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, cooking up that handful of ghee with various
medicines, made that merchant’s wife lie down on her back on a couch and gave
it (to her) through the nose. Then that ghee, given through the nose, came out
through the mouth. Then that merchant’s wife, spitting it into a receptacle,
enjoined a slave-woman, saying:</p>
<p>“Come, now, take up this ghee with cotton.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.12" href="#Kd.8.1.12"></a>
Then it occurred to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: “It is astonishing how stingy this
housewife is, in that she has this ghee, which ought to be thrown away, taken
up with cotton; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.272" href="#Vin.1.272"></a>
many of my very precious medicines went into it, and what kind of a fee will
she give me?”</p>
<p>Then that merchant’s wife, having observed Jīvaka Komārabhacca’s uneasiness,
spoke thus to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: “Teacher, why are you perturbed?”</p>
<p>“It occurred to me in this case: it is astonishing … will she give me?”</p>
<p>“But, teacher, we householders know about this economy; this ghee is excellent
for the servants or workmen for rubbing their feet, or poured out into a lamp.
Do not you, teacher, be perturbed, your fee will not be lacking.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.13" href="#Kd.8.1.13"></a>
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca removed the merchant’s wife’s seven year old disease
of the head by just the one treatment <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.385" href="#BD.4.385"></a>
through the nose. Then that merchant’s wife, being well, gave four thousand to
Jīvaka Komārabhacca; her son, thinking, “My mother is well”, gave four
thousand; her daughter-in-law, thinking, “My mother-in-law is well”, gave four
thousand; the householder, the merchant, thinking, “My wife is well”, gave four
thousand and a slave and a slave-woman and a horse-chariot. Then Jīvaka
Komārabhacca, taking these sixteen thousand and the slave and the slave-woman
and the horse-chariot, set out for Rājagaha; in due course he approached
Abhaya, the king’s son, at Rājagaha; having approached he spoke thus to Abhaya,
the king’s son:</p>
<p>“Sire, this is for my first work: sixteen thousand and a slave and a
slave-woman and a horse-chariot. May your highness accept it as a tribute for
having had me cared for.”</p>
<p>“No, good Jīvaka, let it be for you yourself; but do build a dwelling in our
palace.”</p>
<p>“Very well, sire,” and Jīvaka Komārabhacca having answered Abhaya, the king’s
son, in assent, built a dwelling in the palace of Abhaya, the king’s son.</p>
<h2>The story of King Bimbisāra</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.14" href="#Kd.8.1.14"></a>
Now at that time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha came to suffer from a
fistula; his outer garments were stained with blood. The queens, seeing this,
made fun of him, saying: “Now the king is in his courses, the king is having a
period, soon the king will give birth.” On account of this the king became
ashamed. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha spoke thus to Abhaya, the king’s
son:</p>
<p>“Good Abhaya, I have such a disease that my outer garments are stained with
blood. The queens, seeing this, make fun of me, saying, ‘… the king will give
birth’. Please, good Abhaya, do find a doctor such as could attend me.”</p>
<p>“Sire, there is this Jīvaka of ours, a young doctor of high repute, he will
attend your majesty.”</p>
<p>“Very well, good Abhaya, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.273" href="#Vin.1.273"></a>
command the doctor, Jīvaka, so that he shall attend me.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.15" href="#Kd.8.1.15"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.386" href="#BD.4.386"></a>
Then Abhaya, the king’s son, commanded Jīvaka Komārabhacca, saying: “Go, good
Jīvaka, attend the king.”</p>
<p>“Very well, sire,” and Jīvaka Komārabhaccahaving answered Abhaya, the king’s
son, in assent, taking medicine under his nail, approached King Seniya
Bimbisāra of Magadha; having approached, he spoke thus to King Seniya Bimbisāra
of Magadha:</p>
<p>“Sire, let me see the disease.”</p>
<p>Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca removed King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha’s fistula
with just the one ointment. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, being well,
having had five hundred women adorned with all kinds of ornaments, having made
them take (these) off, having had them made into a pile, spoke thus to Jīvaka
Komārabhacca: “Let all these ornaments of the five hundred women be yours, good
Jīvaka.”</p>
<p>“No, sire, may your majesty remember my office.”</p>
<p>“Well then, good Jīvaka, may you tend me and the women and the Order of monks
with the awakened one at its head.”</p>
<p>“Very well, sire,” Jīvaka Komārabhacca answered King Seniya Bimbisāra of
Magadha in assent.</p>
<h2>The story of the merchant of Rājagaha</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.16" href="#Kd.8.1.16"></a>
Now at that time a merchant of Rājagaha had had a disease of the head for seven
years. Many very great, world-famed doctors who had come had not been able to
cure him. Taking much gold, they went away. Moreover he came to be given up by
the doctors. Some doctors spoke thus: “The householder, the merchant will pass
away on the fifth day.” Some doctors spoke thus: “The householder, the merchant
will pass away on the seventh day.” Then it occurred to the urban council of
Rājagaha: “This householder, the merchant is very useful to the king as well as
to the urban council, but yet he has been given up by the doctors. Some doctors
speak thus: ‘The householder, the merchant will pass away on the fifth day.’
Some doctors speak thus: ‘The householder, the merchant will pass away on the
seventh day.’ Now, this Jīvaka, the king’s doctor, is young and of good repute.
Suppose we should ask Jīvaka, the king’s doctor, to attend the householder, the
merchant?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.17" href="#Kd.8.1.17"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.387" href="#BD.4.387"></a>
Then the urban council of Rājagaha approached King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha;
having approached they spoke thus to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha:</p>
<p>“Sire, this householder, the merchant is very useful to your majesty as well as
to the citizens; but then he is given up by the doctors … ‘… will die on the
seventh day’. It were good if your majesty were to command Jīvaka, the doctor,
to attend the householder, the merchant.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.274" href="#Vin.1.274"></a>
</p>
<p>Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha commanded Jīvaka Komārabhacca, saying:
“Go, good Jivaka, attend the householder, the merchant.”</p>
<p>“Very well, sire,” and Jīvaka Komārabhaccahaving answered King Seniya Bimbisāra
of Magadha in assent, approached that householder, the merchant; having
approached, having observed the uneasiness of the householder, the merchant, he
spoke thus to the householder, the merchant:</p>
<p>“If I, householder, should make you well, what would be my fee?”</p>
<p>“All my property shall become yours, teacher, and I will be your slave.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.18" href="#Kd.8.1.18"></a>
“Now, householder, are you able to lie down on one side for seven months?”</p>
<p>“I am able, teacher, to lie down on one side for seven months.”</p>
<p>“Now, householder, are you able to lie down on the other side for seven
months?”</p>
<p>“I am able, teacher, to lie down on the other side for seven months.”</p>
<p>“Now, householder, are you able to lie down on your back for seven months?”</p>
<p>“I am able, teacher, to lie down on my back for seven months.”</p>
<p>Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, having made the householder, the merchant lie down on
a couch, having strapped him to the couch, having cut open the skin of his
head, having opened a suture in the skull, having drawn out two living
creatures, showed them to the people, saying:</p>
<p>“Do you see, masters, these two living creatures, the one small, the other
large? This large living creature was seen <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.388" href="#BD.4.388"></a>
by those teachers who spoke thus: ‘The householder, the merchant will pass away
on the fifth day’; on the fifth day it would have destroyed the brain of the
householder, the merchant, and when the brain had been destroyed the
householder, the merchant would have passed away. It was rightly seen by those
teachers. This small living creature was seen by those teachers who spoke thus:
‘The householder, the merchant will pass away on the seventh day’; on the
seventh day it would have destroyed the brain of the householder, the merchant,
and when the brain had been destroyed the householder, the merchant would have
passed away. It was rightly seen by those teachers.” And having closed the
suture of the skull, having sewn up the skin of the head, he applied an
ointment.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.19" href="#Kd.8.1.19"></a>
Then the householder, the merchant, when seven days had passed, spoke thus to
Jīvaka Komārabhacca:</p>
<p>“I am not able, teacher, to lie down on one side for seven months.”</p>
<p>“But did you not, householder, answer me in assent, saying: ‘I am able,
teacher, to he down on one side for seven months’?”</p>
<p>“It is true, teacher, that I answered thus, but I will die, I am not able to
lie down on one side for seven months.”</p>
<p>“Well then, householder, you lie down on the other side for seven months.”</p>
<p>Then the householder, the merchant, when seven days had passed, spoke thus to
Jīvaka Komārabhacca: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.275" href="#Vin.1.275"></a>
</p>
<p>“I am not able, teacher, to lie down on the other side for seven months.”</p>
<p>“But did you not, householder, answer me in assent, saying: ‘I am able,
teacher, to lie down on the other side for seven months’?”</p>
<p>“It is true, teacher, that I answered thus, but I will die, I am not able to
lie down on the other side for seven months.”</p>
<p>“Well then, householder, you lie down on your back for seven months.”</p>
<p>Then the householder, the merchant, when seven days had passed, spoke thus to
Jīvaka Komārabhacca:</p>
<p>“I am not able, teacher, to lie down on my back for seven months.”</p>
<p>“But did you not, householder, answer me in assent, saying: <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.389" href="#BD.4.389"></a>
‘I am able, teacher, to lie down on my back for seven months’?</p>
<p>“It is true, teacher, that I answered thus, but I will die I am not able to lie
down on my back for seven months.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.20" href="#Kd.8.1.20"></a>
“If I, householder, had not spoken to you thus, you would not have lain down so
long (as this); but I knew beforehand that the householder, the merchant would
become well in three times seven days. Rise up, householder, you are well; find
what is my fee.”</p>
<p>“All my property shall become yours, teacher, and I will be your slave.”</p>
<p>“No, householder, do not give me all your property and do not be my slave; give
a hundred thousand to the king and a hundred thousand to me.”</p>
<p>Then the householder, the merchant, being well, gave a hundred thousand to the
king and a hundred thousand to Jīvaka Komārabhacca.</p>
<h2>The story of the merchant’s son</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.21" href="#Kd.8.1.21"></a>
Now at that time the son of a merchant of Benares, while playing at turning
somersaults, came to suffer from a twist in the bowels, so that he did not
properly digest the conjey that he drank nor did he properly digest the food
that he ate or relieve himself regularly. Because of this he became thin,
wretched, his colour bad, yellowish, the veins showing all over his body. Then
it occurred to the merchant of Benares:</p>
<p>“Now what kind of affliction has my son? He does not properly digest the conjey
that he drinks and he does not properly digest the food that he eats and he
does not relieve himself regularly. Because of this he is thin, wretched, of a
bad colour, yellowish, the veins showing all over his body. What now if I,
having gone to Rājagaha, should ask the king for Jīvaka, the doctor, to attend
my son?”</p>
<p>Then the merchant of Benares, having gone to Rājagaha, approached King Seniya
Bimbisāra of Magadha; having approached, he spoke thus to King Seniya Bimbisāra
of Magadha:</p>
<p>“Sire, my son has this kind of affliction: he does not
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.390" href="#BD.4.390"></a>
properly digest … the veins showing all over his body. It were good if your
majesty <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.276" href="#Vin.1.276"></a>
were to command Jīvaka, the doctor, to attend my son.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.22" href="#Kd.8.1.22"></a>
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha commanded Jīvaka Komārabhacca, saying:
“Go, good Jīvaka, having gone to Benares, attend the son of the merchant of
Benares.”</p>
<p>“Very well, sire,” and Jīvaka Komārabhacca having answered King Seniya
Bimbisāra of Magadha in assent, having gone to Benares, approached the son of
the merchant of Benares; having approached, having observed the uneasiness of
the son of the merchant of Benares, having caused the people to be turned away,
having surrounded him with a curtain, having tied him to a post, having placed
his wife in front (of him), having cut open the skin of his stomach, having
drawn out the twisted bowel, showed it to his wife, saying: “See, this was your
husband’s affliction; because of this he did not properly digest the conjey
that he drank and did not properly digest the food that he ate and did not
relieve himself regularly; because of this he is thin, wretched, his colour
bad, yellowish, the veins showing all over his body.” Having straightened out
the twisted bowel, having put back the bowel again, having sewn up the skin of
the stomach, he applied an ointment. Then the son of the merchant of Benares
soon became well. Then the merchant of Benares, saying: “My son is well,” gave
sixteen thousand to Jīvaka Komārabhacca. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, taking those
sixteen thousand, went back again to Rājagaha.</p>
<h2>The story of King Pajjota</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.23" href="#Kd.8.1.23"></a>
Now at that time King Pajjota came to be suffering from jaundice. Many very
great, world-famed doctors, who had come had not been able to cure him; taking
much gold, they went away. Then King Pajjota sent a messenger to King Seniya
Bimbisāra of Magadha, saying: “I have this kind of disease; it would be good if
your majesty were to command Jīvaka, the doctor, so that he should attend me.”
Then King Bimbisāra of Magadha commanded Jīvaka Komārabhacca, saying: “Go, good
Jīvaka, having gone to Ujjenī, attend King Pajjota.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.391" href="#BD.4.391"></a>
“Very well, sire,” and Jīvaka Komārabhaccahaving answered King Seniya Bimbisāra
of Magadha in assent, having gone to Ujjenī, approached King Pajjota, and
having approached, having observed his uneasiness, he spoke thus to King
Pajjota:</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.24" href="#Kd.8.1.24"></a>
“Sire, I will cook up some ghee, and your majesty will drink it.”</p>
<p>“No, good Jīvaka, do what you can to make (me) well without ghee; ghee is
abhorrent to me, loathsome.” Then it occurred to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.277" href="#Vin.1.277"></a>
“The king’s disease is of such a kind that it is not possible to make him well
without ghee. Suppose I should cook up the ghee (so that it has) the colour of
an astringent decoction, the smell of an astringent decoction, the taste of an
astringent decoction?”</p>
<p>Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca cooked up the ghee with various medicines (so that it
had) the colour of an astringent decoction, the smell of an astringent
decoction, the taste of an astringent decoction. Then it occurred to Jīvaka
Komārabhacca: “When the king has drunk and digested the ghee, it will make him
sick. This king is violent, he might have me killed. Suppose I should ask (for
permission to go away) beforehand?” Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca approached King
Pajjota; having approached he spoke thus to King Pajjota:</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.25" href="#Kd.8.1.25"></a>
“Sire, we doctors at such a moment as this are pulling up roots, gathering
medicines. It were good if your majesty were to command at the stables and at
the gateways, saying: ‘Let Jīvaka go out by means of whatever conveyance he
desires, let him go out by whatever gateway he desires, let <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.392" href="#BD.4.392"></a>
him go out at whatever time he desires, let him come in at whatever time he
desires’.” Then King Pajjota commanded at the stables and at the gateways,
saying: “Let Jīvaka go out by means of whatever conveyance he desires, let him
go out by whatever gateway he desires, let him go out at whatever time he
desires, let him come in at whatever time he desires.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time King Pajjota had a she-elephant, called Bhaddavatikā, who
could do fifty <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca offered the ghee to King Pajjota, saying: “Let your
majesty drink an astringent decoction.” Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca having made
King Pajjota drink the ghee, having gone to the elephant stable, hastened out
of the city on the she-elephant, Bhaddavatikā.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.26" href="#Kd.8.1.26"></a>
Then King Pajjota, when he had drunk and digested the ghee, was sick. Then King
Pajjota spoke thus to the people: “Good sirs, the wicked Jīvaka has made me
drink ghee. Well now, good sirs, look for the doctor, Jīvaka.”</p>
<p>“Sire, he has hastened out of the city on the she-elephant, Bhaddavatikā.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time King Pajjota came to have a slave called Kāka, who could do
sixty <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> and who was born of a non-human being. Then King Pajjota commanded the slave,
Kāka, saying: “Go, good Kāka, make Jīvaka, the doctor, return, saying, ‘The
king, teacher, orders you to come back’. Now, good Kāka, these doctors are full
of cunning, so do not accept any thing from him.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.27" href="#Kd.8.1.27"></a>
And the slave, Kāka, caught up Jīvaka Komārabhacca on the road to Kosambī as he
was having breakfast. Then Kāka, the slave, spoke thus to Jīvaka Komārabhacca:
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.278" href="#Vin.1.278"></a>
“The king, teacher, orders you to come back.”</p>
<p>“Wait, good Kāka, until we have eaten; come, good Kāka, you eat.”</p>
<p>“No, teacher, I am commanded by the king, saying: ‘Now good Kāka, these doctors
are full of cunning, so do not accept anything from him’.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time Jīvaka Komārabhacca, having stripped <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.393" href="#BD.4.393"></a>
off the medicinal (part) with his nail, was eating an emblic myrobalan and
drinking water. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca spoke thus to Kāka, the slave: “Here,
good Kāka, eat the emblic myrobalan and drink the water.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.28" href="#Kd.8.1.28"></a>
Then Kāka, the slave, thinking: “This doctor is eating the emblic myrobalan and
drinking the water, there should not be anything harmful,” ate half the emblic
myrobalan and drank the water. But he ejected that half emblic myrobalan that
he was eating, on the spot. Then Kāka, the slave, spoke thus to Jīvaka
Komārabhacca:</p>
<p>“Is there life for me, teacher?”</p>
<p>“Do not be afraid, good Kāka, for you will get well; but the king is violent,
that king might have me killed, so I am not coming back,” and giving the
she-elephant, Bhaddavatikā, into Kāka’s charge, he set out for Rājagaha; in due
course he approached Rājagaha, and King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha; having
approached he told this matter to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha.</p>
<p>“You did well, good Jīvaka, in not going back, that king is violent, he might
have you killed.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.29" href="#Kd.8.1.29"></a>
Then King Pajjota, being well, sent a messenger to Jīvaka Komārabhacca, saying:
“Let Jīvaka come, I will grant him a boon.”</p>
<p>“No, master, let his majesty remember my office.”</p>
<h2>On a pair of Siveyyaka cloths</h2>
<p>Now at that time there accrued to King Pajjota a pair of Siveyyaka cloths which
were the chief and best and foremost and most excellent and loveliest of many
cloths, of many pairs <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.394" href="#BD.4.394"></a>
of cloths, of many hundred pairs of cloths, of many thousand pairs of cloths,
of many hundred thousand pairs of cloths. Then King Pajjota sent this pair of
Siveyyaka cloths to Jīvaka Komārabhacca. Then it occurred to Jīvaka
Komārabhacca:</p>
<p>“This pair of Siveyyaka cloths, sent me by King Pajjota, is the most excellent
and loveliest of many cloths …; no one else is worthy of it but the Lord, the
perfected one, the wholly awakened one, or King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha.”</p>
<h2>On exactly thirty purges</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.30" href="#Kd.8.1.30"></a>
Now at that time the Lord came to have a disturbance of the humours of his
body. Then the Lord addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.279" href="#Vin.1.279"></a>
“Ānanda, the Truth-finder has a disturbance of the humours of his body; the
Truth-finder desires to take a purgative.” Then the venerable Ānanda approached
Jīvaka Komārabhacca; having approached he spoke thus to Jīvaka Komārabhacca:</p>
<p>“Jīvaka, sir, the Truth-finder has a disturbance of the humours of his body;
the Truth-finder desires to take a purgative.”</p>
<p>“Well now, revered Ānanda, lubricate the Truth-finder’s body for a few days.”
Then the venerable Ānanda, having lubricated the Truth-finder’s body for a few
days, approached Jīvaka Komārabhacca; having approached he spoke thus to Jīvaka
Komārabhacca:</p>
<p>“Jīvaka, sir, the Truth-finder’s body has been lubricated; what do you think is
right for him now?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.31" href="#Kd.8.1.31"></a>
Then it occurred to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: “It is not suitable that I should give
a strong purgative to the Lord,” and having had three handfuls of lotuses mixed
with various <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.395" href="#BD.4.395"></a>
medicines, he approached the Lord; having approached he offered the Lord one
handful of lotuses, saying: “Lord, may the Lord sniff up (the scent of) this
first handful of lotuses; this will purge the Lord ten times.” Then he offered
the Lord the second handful of lotuses, saying: “Lord, may the Lord sniff up
(the scent of) this second handful of lotuses; this will purge the Lord ten
times.” Then he offered the Lord the third handful of lotuses, saying: “Lord,
may the Lord sniff up (the scent of) this third handful of lotuses; this will
purge the Lord ten times”; thus, he thought that the Lord would be purged all
together thirty times. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, having given the Lord a
purgative for thirty times all together, having greeted the Lord, departed
keeping his right side towards him.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.32" href="#Kd.8.1.32"></a>
Then it occurred to Jīvaka Komārabhacca when he had gone outside the porch: “A
purgative has been given by me to the Lord for all together thirty times. The
Lord has a disturbance of the humours of his body; it will not purge the Lord
all together thirty times, it will purge the Lord twenty-nine times, but then
the Lord, being purged, will bathe; when he has bathed, the Lord will purge
once, thus the Lord will be purged all together thirty times.” Then the Lord,
knowing by mind the reasoning in the mind of Jīvaka Komārabhacca, addressed the
venerable Ānanda, saying:</p>
<p>“Now, Ānanda, it occurred to Jīvaka Komārabhacca when he had gone outside the
porch: ‘A purgative has been given by me to the Lord … thus the Lord will be
purged all together thirty times.’ Well now, Ānanda, prepare (some) hot
water.”</p>
<p>“Very well, Lord,” and the venerable Ānanda having answered the Lord in assent,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.280" href="#Vin.1.280"></a>
prepared (some) hot water.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.33" href="#Kd.8.1.33"></a>
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted
the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a
respectful distance, Jīvaka Komārabhacca spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, is the
Lord purged?”</p>
<p>“I am purged, Jīvaka.”</p>
<p>“Now, Lord, it occurred to me after I had gone outside <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.396" href="#BD.4.396"></a>
the porch: ‘A purgative has been given by me to the Lord … thus the Lord will
be purged all together thirty times.’ Lord, let the Lord bathe, let the
well-farer bathe.” Then the Lord bathed in the hot water; when he had bathed
the Lord purged once; thus the Lord purged all together thirty times. Then
Jīvaka Komārabhacca spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, until the Lord’s body comes
to be normal, almsfood of juices will be enough.”</p>
<h2>On asking for a boon</h2>
<p>And the Lord’s body soon became normal.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.34" href="#Kd.8.1.34"></a>
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, taking that pair of Siveyyaka cloths, approached the
Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful
distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, Jīvaka Komārabhacca
spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, I ask one boon of the Lord.”</p>
<p>“Jīvaka, Truth-finders are beyond (granting) boons.”</p>
<p>“Lord, it is what is allowable and what is blameless.”</p>
<p>“Speak on, Jīvaka.”</p>
<p>“Lord, the Lord and the Order of monks are wearers of rag-robes. Lord, this
pair of Siveyyaka cloths was sent me by King Pajjota; of many cloths, of many
pairs of cloths, of many hundred pairs of cloths, of many thousand pairs of
cloths, of many hundred thousand pairs of cloths, it is the chief and best and
foremost and most excellent and loveliest. Lord, may the Lord accept my pair of
Siveyyaka cloths, and may he allow householders’ robes to the Order of monks.”
The Lord accepted the pair of Siveyyaka cloths. Then the Lord gladdened,
rejoiced, roused, delighted Jīvaka Komārabhacca with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk. And when Jīvaka Komārabhacca had been gladdened … delighted by the Lord
with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk, rising from his seat, greeting the Lord, he departed keeping his right
side towards him.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.35" href="#Kd.8.1.35"></a>
Then the Lord, on this occasion, having given <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.397" href="#BD.4.397"></a>
“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, householders’ robes. Whoever wishes may be a rag-robe
wearer; whoever wishes may consent to (accept) householders’ robes. And I,
monks, commend satisfaction with the one or the other.</span>”</p>
<p>People in Rājagaha heard: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.281" href="#Vin.1.281"></a>
“Householders’ robes are allowed to monks by the Lord,” and these people became
joyful, elated, thinking: “Now we will give gifts, we will work merit, inasmuch
as householders’ robes are allowed to monks by the Lord.” And in just one day
many thousand robes were produced in Rājagaha.</p>
<p>Country-people heard: “Householders’ robes are allowed to monks by the Lord,”
and these people became joyful and elated, thinking: ‘Now we will give gifts,
we will work merit, inasmuch as householders’ robes are allowed to monks by the
Lord.” And in just one day many thousand robes were produced in the country.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.1.36" href="#Kd.8.1.36"></a>
Now at that time a mantle accrued to the Order. They told this matter to the
Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a mantle.</span>” A silk mantle accrued. “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a silk mantle</span>,” he said. A fleecy coverlet accrued. “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a fleecy coverlet</span>,” he said.</p>
<p class="end">Told is the First Portion for Repeating.</p>
<h2>On permission for woollen garments, etc.</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.8.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.2.1" href="#Kd.8.2.1"></a>
Now at that time the king of Kāsi sent woollen stuff that
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.398" href="#BD.4.398"></a>
was worth half a <i lang="pi">kāsi</i>, being valued at half a <i lang="pi">kāsi</i>, to Jīvaka Komārabhacca. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, taking that woollen stuff
that was worth half a kāsi, approached the Lord; having approached, having
greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down
at a respectful distance, Jīvaka Komārabhacca spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord,
this woollen stuff that is worth half a <i lang="pi">kāsi</i>, being valued at half a <i lang="pi">kāsi</i>, was sent to me by the king of Kāsi. Lord, may the Lord accept the woollen
stuff from me that it may be for me a blessing and a happiness for a long
time.” The Lord accepted the woollen stuff. Then the Lord gladdened, rejoiced,
roused, delighted Jīvaka Komārabhacca with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk. Jīvaka Komārabhacca, gladdened … with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping his right side towards him.
Then the Lord, on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the
monks, saying: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, woollen stuff.</span>”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.8.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.3.1" href="#Kd.8.3.1"></a>
At that time various kinds of robe-material accrued to the Order. Then it
occurred to the monks: “Now, what (kind of) robe-materials are allowed by the
Lord, what are not allowed?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:
“Monks, <span class="allowance">I allow six (kinds of) robe-materials: linen, cotton, silk, wool, coarse hempen
cloth, canvas.</span>”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.3.2" href="#Kd.8.3.2"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.399" href="#BD.4.399"></a>
Now at that time these monks
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.282" href="#Vin.1.282"></a>
consented to householders’ robes; (but) being scrupulous, they did not consent
to rag-robes, thinking: “Only one (kind of) robe is allowed by the Lord, not
two (kinds).” They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Monks, I allow him
who consents to householders’ robes to consent also to rag-robes. And I, monks,
commend satisfaction with both.”</p>

Now at that time several monks came to be going along a high-road in the Kosala
country. Some monks went into a cemetery for rag-robes, other monks did not
wait. Those monks who went into the cemetery for rag-robes obtained rag-robes;
those monks who did not wait spoke thus: “Your reverences, give us also a

<p>These spoke thus: “Your reverences, we will not give you a portion; why did you

Now at that time people, taking robe-material, came to a monastery; these, not

<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to agree upon a monk endowed with five qualities as
guardian of the store-room: one who would not follow a wrong course through
partiality … one who would not follow a wrong course through fear, and one who
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.403" href="#BD.4.403"></a>
would know what is guarded and what is not guarded.</span> And thus, monks, should he be agreed upon … ‘<span class="kamma">… The monk so and so is agreed upon by the Order as guardian of the store-room.
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.285" href="#Vin.1.285"></a>
It is pleasing to the Order; therefore it is silent. Thus do I understand this</span>’.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.8.2" href="#Kd.8.8.2"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks turned away the guardian of a
store-room. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, a guardian of a store-room is not to be turned away. Whoever should turn
him away, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.8.9"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.9.1" href="#Kd.8.9.1"></a>
Now at that time robe-material came to be heaped up in an Order’s store-room.
They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to distribute it by means of the Order that is present.</span>” Then the whole Order, distributing the robe-material, made a tumult. They
told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to agree upon a monk endowed with five qualities as
distributor of robe-material: one who would not follow a wrong course through
partiality … one who would not follow a wrong course through fear, and one who
would know what is distributed and what is not distributed.</span> And thus, monks, should he be agreed upon … ‘…
<span class="kamma">The monk so and so is agreed upon by the Order as distributor of robe-material.
It is pleasing to the Order; therefore it is silent. Thus do I understand this</span>’.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.9.2" href="#Kd.8.9.2"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.404" href="#BD.4.404"></a>
Then it occurred to the monks who were the distributors of robe-material: “Now,
how should we distribute the robe-material?” They told this matter to the Lord.
He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, having first examined it, having estimated it, having
equalised it, having counted the monks, having formed them into sections, to
arrange a share of the robe-material (for each section).</span>”</p>
<p>Then it occurred to the monks who were the distributors of robe-material: “Now,
how should a share of the robe-material be given to novices?” They told this
matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to give half a share to novices.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.9.3" href="#Kd.8.9.3"></a>
Now at that time a certain monk became desirous of crossing over with his own
portion. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to give his own portion to one who is crossing over.</span>” Now at that time a certain monk became desirous of crossing over with more
than one portion. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monk, to give more than one portion if he gives a compensation.</span>”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.9.4" href="#Kd.8.9.4"></a>
Then it occurred to the monks who were the distributors
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.405" href="#BD.4.405"></a>
of robe-material: “Now, how should a share of the robe-material be given: in
the order in which they came in, or according to seniority?” They told this
matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, having made good anything lacking, to cast lots with
kusa-grass.</span>”</p>
<h2>On dying robes</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.8.10"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.10.1" href="#Kd.8.10.1"></a>
Now at that time monks
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.286" href="#Vin.1.286"></a>
dyed robe-material with dung and with yellow clay; the robe-material came to be
a bad colour. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, six (kinds of) dyes: dye from roots, dye from stems, dye
from bark, dye from leaves, dye from flowers, dye from fruits.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.10.2" href="#Kd.8.10.2"></a>
Now at that time monks dyed robe-material with cold water; the robe-material
came to smell nasty. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a little dye-pot in which to boil the dye.</span>” The dye was spilt. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, you, monks, to arrange a basin (to prevent the dye from) spilling.</span>”
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.406" href="#BD.4.406"></a>
Now at that time the monks did not know whether the dye had boiled or had not
(fully) boiled. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to put a drop into water or on to the back of your nail.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.10.3" href="#Kd.8.10.3"></a>
Now at that time monks, pouring out the dye, upset the pot; the pot was broken.
They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a ladle for the dye, a scoop with a handle.</span>” Now at that time the monks did not have a dye-vessel. They told this matter
to the Lord. He said “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a pitcher for the dye, a bowl for the dye.</span>” Now at that time monks steeped robe-material in a dish and also in a bowl,
the robe-material was split. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a trough for the dye.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.8.11"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.11.1" href="#Kd.8.11.1"></a>
Now at that time monks spread out robe-material on the ground; the
robe-material became dusty. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a grass matting.</span>” The grass matting was eaten by white ants. They told this matter to the Lord.
He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a bamboo (for hanging up) robe-material, a cord for
(hanging up) robe-material.</span>” They hung it up by the middle; the dye dripped down on both sides. They told
this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to fasten it at a corner.</span>” The corner wore out. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a corner- <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.407" href="#BD.4.407"></a>
thread.</span>” The dye dripped down on one side. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:
“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks to dye it, turning it and turning it, and not to go away if
the drips have not ceased.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.11.2" href="#Kd.8.11.2"></a>
Now at that time robe-material became stiff. They told this matter to the Lord.
He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to put it into water.</span>” Now at that time robe-material became harsh. They told this matter to the
Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to beat it with the hands.</span>”
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.287" href="#Vin.1.287"></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time monks wore yellow robes, (the colour) of ivory, not cut up.
People looked down, criticised, spread-it about, saying: “Like the householders
who enjoy pleasures of the senses.” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:
“<span class="rule">Monks, robes that are not cut up are not to be worn. Whoever should wear one,
there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<h2>Allowance for cut-up cloth</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.8.12"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.12.1" href="#Kd.8.12.1"></a>
Then the Lord, having stayed in Rājagaha for as long as he found suitable, set
out on tour for Dakkhiṇāgiri. The Lord saw the field of Magadha, laid <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.408" href="#BD.4.408"></a>
out in strips, laid out in lines, laid out in embankments, laid out in squares,
and seeing this, he addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying:</p>
<p>“Now, do you Ānanda, see the field of Magadha laid out in strips … laid out in
squares?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Lord.”</p>
<p>“Are you able, Ānanda, to provide robes like this for the monks?”</p>
<p>“I am able, Lord.”</p>
<p>Then the Lord, having stayed at Dakkhiṇāgiri for as long as he found suitable,
went back again to Rājagaha. Then the venerable Ānanda, having provided robes
for several monks, approached the Lord; having approached he spoke thus to the
Lord:</p>
<p>“Lord, let the Lord see the robes provided by me.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.12.2" href="#Kd.8.12.2"></a>
Then the Lord, on that occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the
monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks, clever is Ānanda; monks, of great intelligence is Ānanda, inasmuch as
he can understand in detail the meaning of that which was spoken of by me in
brief, and can make a cross-seam and can make a short cross-seam and can make a
circular seam and can make a short circular seam and can <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.409" href="#BD.4.409"></a>
make a central piece and can make side pieces and can make a neck-piece and can
make a knee-piece and can make an elbow-piece; and what is cut up must be
roughly darned together, suitable for recluses and not coveted by opponents. <span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, an outer cloak that is cut up, an upper robe that is cut
up, an inner robe that is cut up.</span>”</p>
<h2>Allowance for three robes</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.8.13"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.13.1" href="#Kd.8.13.1"></a>
Then the Lord, having stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he found suitable, set
out on tour for Vesālī. As the Lord was going along the high-road between
Rājagaha and Vesālī he saw several monks coming along smothered up in robes,
having put a mattress of robes on their heads and a mattress of robes on their
backs and a mattress of robes on their hips, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.410" href="#BD.4.410"></a>
and seeing (them) it occurred to the Lord: “These foolish men are turned too
quickly to abundance of robes; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.288" href="#Vin.1.288"></a>
suppose I were to set a limit, were to establish bounds as to robes for the
monks?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.13.2" href="#Kd.8.13.2"></a>
Then the Lord, walking on tour, in due course arrived at Vesālī. The Lord
stayed there in Vesālī in the Gotamaka shrine. Now at that time on the cold
winter nights between the “eights”, in a time of snowfall, the Lord sat down in
the open air at night with (only) one robe; the Lord was not cold. As the first
watch of the night was ending the Lord became cold. The Lord put on a second
robe; the Lord was not cold. As the middle watch of the night was ending the
Lord became cold. The Lord put on a third robe; the Lord was not cold. As the
last watch of the night was ending, as the sun was rising, in the flush of
dawn, the Lord became cold. The Lord put on a fourth robe; the Lord was not
cold.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.13.3" href="#Kd.8.13.3"></a>
Then it occurred to the Lord: “Even those who in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline are sons of respectable families, susceptible to cold, afraid
of cold, even these are able to keep themselves going with three robes. Suppose
I were to set a limit, were to establish bounds as to robes for monks—were to
allow three robes?” Then the Lord, on this occasion, having given reasoned
talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.13.4" href="#Kd.8.13.4"></a>
“Now as I, monks, was going along the high-road between Rājagaha and Vesālī, I
saw several monks coming along smothered up in robes, having put a mattress of
robes on <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.411" href="#BD.4.411"></a>
their heads and a mattress of robes on their backs and a mattress of robes on
their hips; seeing them, it occurred to me: ‘These foolish men have turned too
quickly to abundance of robes; suppose I were to set a limit, were to establish
bounds as to robes for monks?’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.13.5" href="#Kd.8.13.5"></a>
“Then I, monks, on the cold winter nights between the ‘eights’, in a time of
snowfall, sat down in the open air at night with (only) one robe; I was not
cold. As the first watch of the night was ending I became cold. I put on a
second robe; I was not cold. As the middle watch of the night was ending I
became cold. I put on a third robe; I was not cold. As the last watch of the
night was ending, as the sun was rising, in the flush of dawn, I became cold. I
put on a fourth robe; I was not cold. Then, monks, it occurred to me: ‘Even

I were to set a limit, were to establish bounds as to robes for monks <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.289" href="#Vin.1.289"></a>
and were to allow three robes? ’
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, three robes: a double outer cloak, a single upper robe, a
single inner robe.</span>”</p>
<h2>On extra robes</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.13.6" href="#Kd.8.13.6"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks, saying: “Three robes are allowed by
the Lord,” entered a village in one set of three robes, remained in the
monastery in another set of three robes, went down to bathe in another set of
three robes. Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread
it about, saying: “How can the group of six monks wear an extra robe?” Then
these monks told this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord, on this occasion,
having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, an extra robe should not be worn; whoever should wear (one) should be
dealt with according to the rule.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.13.7" href="#Kd.8.13.7"></a>
Now at that time an extra robe accrued to the venerable
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.412" href="#BD.4.412"></a>
Ānanda; and the venerable Ānanda wanted to give this robe to the venerable
Sāriputta, but the venerable Sāriputta was staying at Sāketa. Then it occurred
to the venerable Ānanda: “It is laid down by the Lord that an extra robe should
not be worn. And this extra robe has accrued to me, and I want to give this
robe to the venerable Sāriputta, but the venerable Sāriputta is staying at
Sāketa. Now what line of conduct should be followed by me?” Then the venerable
Ānanda told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“But how long, Ānanda, before Sāriputta will come (here)?”</p>
<p>“Lord, on the ninth or tenth day,” he said.</p>
<p>Then the Lord, on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the
monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to wear an extra robe for at most ten days.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.13.8" href="#Kd.8.13.8"></a>
Now at that time an extra robe accrued to monks. Then it occurred to these
monks: “Now what line of conduct should be followed in regard to an extra
robe?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to assign an extra robe.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.8.14"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.14.1" href="#Kd.8.14.1"></a>
Then the Lord, having stayed at Vesālī for as long as he found suitable, set
out on tour for Benares. Walking on tour, in due course he arrived at Benares.
The Lord stayed there near Benares in the deer-park at Isipatana. Now at that
time a certain monk’s inner robe came to be torn. Then it occurred to that
monk: “Three robes are allowed by the Lord: the double outer cloak, the single
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.290" href="#Vin.1.290"></a>
upper robe, the single inner robe. But my inner robe is torn. Suppose I were to
insert a patch, so that it will be double cloth all round, single in the
middle?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.14.2" href="#Kd.8.14.2"></a>
Then that monk inserted a patch. As the Lord was touring the lodgings he saw
that monk inserting the patch; seeing <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.413" href="#BD.4.413"></a>
(him) he approached that monk, having approached, he spoke thus to that monk:</p>
<p>“What are you doing, monk?”</p>
<p>“I am inserting a patch, Lord.”</p>
<p>“It is very good, monk, it is good that you, monk, insert a patch.”</p>
<p>Then the Lord, on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the
monks, saying:</p>
<p>“
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, when clothes are unsoiled, when what is allowable is
unsoiled, a double outer cloak, a single upper robe, a single inner robe; when
garments are thin from use a fourfold outer cloak, a double upper robe, a
double inner robe.</span> As far as possible an effort is to be made (to get patches) from a rag-robe,
from (bits picked up near) a shop. <span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a patch, a means of fastening, a length, a marking (with a
piece of cloth), a strengthening.</span>”</p>
<h2>The story of Visākhā</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.8.15"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.15.1" href="#Kd.8.15.1"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.291" href="#Vin.1.291"></a>
Then the Lord, having stayed at Benares for as long as he found suitable, set
out on tour for Sāvatthī. Walking on tour, in due course he arrived at
Sāvatthī. The Lord stayed there at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in
Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, approached the Lord;
having approached, having greeted the Lord, she sat down at a respectful
distance. As she was sitting down at a respectful distance, the Lord gladdened
… delighted Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk. Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, when she had been gladdened … delighted
by the Lord with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk, spoke thus to the Lord:</p>
<p>“Lord, may the Lord consent (to accept) from me a meal on the morrow together
with the Order of monks.”</p>
<p>The Lord consented by becoming silent. Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, having
understood the Lord’s consent, rising <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.414" href="#BD.4.414"></a>
from her seat, greeting the Lord, departed keeping her right side towards him.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.15.2" href="#Kd.8.15.2"></a>
Then towards the end of that night a great cloud rained down in the four
continents. Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks, even as it is raining in the Jeta Grove, so it is raining in the four
continents. Let your bodies get wet with the rain, monks, this is the last
great cloud over the four continents.”</p>
<p>“Very well, Lord,” and these monks having answered the Lord <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.292" href="#Vin.1.292"></a>
in assent, with their robes laid aside let their bodies get wet with the rain.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.15.3" href="#Kd.8.15.3"></a>
Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, having had sumptuous food, solid and soft,
prepared, commanded a woman-slave, saying:</p>
<p>“Go now, having gone to the monastery, announce the time, saying, ‘Lord, it is
time, the meal is ready’.”</p>
<p>“Very well, lady,” and this slave-woman, having answered Visākhā, Migāra’s
mother in assent, having gone to the monastery, saw the monks, their robes laid
aside, letting their bodies get wet with the rain. Seeing them, she thought:
“There are no monks in the monastery, naked ascetics are letting their bodies
get wet with the rain.” She approached Visākhā, Migāra’s mother; having
approached, she spoke thus to Visākhā, Migāra’s mother:</p>
<p>“Lady, there are no monks in the monastery, naked ascetics are letting their
bodies get wet with the rain.” Then it occurred to Visākhā, Migāra’s mother—she
being clever, experienced, wise: “But undoubtedly it is the masters, their
robes laid aside, who are letting their bodies get wet with the rain; this
foolish woman thinks that there are no monks in the monastery, (but) that naked
ascetics are letting their bodies get wet with the rain.” She commanded the
woman-slave, saying: “Go now, having gone to the monastery, announce the time,
saying, ‘Lord, it is time, the meal is ready’.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.15.4" href="#Kd.8.15.4"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.415" href="#BD.4.415"></a>
Then these monks, having cooled their limbs, being refreshed in body, having
taken up their robes, entered (each) his own dwelling-place. Then that
woman-slave, having gone to the monastery, not seeing the monks, thinking:
“There are no monks in the monastery, the monastery is empty,” approached
Visākhā, Migāra’s mother; having approached, she spoke thus to Visākhā,
Migāra’s mother:</p>
<p>“Lady, there are no monks in the monastery, the monastery is empty.” Then it
occurred to Visākhā, Migāra’s mother—she being clever, experienced, wise: “But
undoubtedly the masters, having cooled their limbs, being refreshed in body,
having taken up their robes, have (each) entered his own dwelling-place; this
foolish woman thinks that there are no monks in the monastery, that the
monastery is empty.” She commanded the woman-slave, saying: “Go now, having
gone to the monastery, announce the time, saying, ‘Lord, it is time, the meal
is ready’.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.15.5" href="#Kd.8.15.5"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: “Monks, arrange your bowls and
robes, it is time for the meal.”</p>
<p>“Very well, Lord,” these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>
<p>Then the Lord, dressing in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, having
vanished from the Jeta Grove, just as a strong man might stretch out his bent
arm, or might bend back his outstretched arm, became visible in the porch
belonging to Visākhā, Migāra’s mother. Then the Lord sat down on an appointed
seat together with the Order of monks.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.15.6" href="#Kd.8.15.6"></a>
Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, saying: “Wonderful, good sirs, marvellous, good
sirs, is the great psychic power, the great majesty of the Truth-finder, in
that although the floods are rolling on knee-deep, and although the floods are
rolling on waist-deep, yet neither the feet nor the robes of a single monk have
become wet,” and joyful, exultant, having with her own hand served and
satisfied the Order of monks with the awakened one at their head with sumptuous
solid and soft food, she sat down at a respectful distance after the Lord had
eaten and had removed his hand from the bowl. As she was sitting down at a
respectful distance, Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, spoke thus to the Lord:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.416" href="#BD.4.416"></a>
“Lord, I ask eight boons of the Lord.”</p>
<p>“Visākhā, Truth-finders are beyond (granting) boons.”</p>
<p>“Lord, they are those which are allowable and those which are blameless.”</p>
<p>“Speak on, Visākhā.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.15.7" href="#Kd.8.15.7"></a>
“I, Lord, want to give for life to the Order cloths for the rains, to give food
for those coming in, to give food for those going out, to give food for the
sick, to give food for those who tend the sick, to give medicine for the sick,
to give a constant supply of conjey, to give bathing-cloths for the Order of
nuns.”</p>
<p>“But having what special reason in mind, do you, Visākhā, ask the Truth-finder
for eight boons?”</p>
<p>“Now I, Lord, commanded a slave-woman, saying, ‘Go now, having gone to the
monastery, announce the time, saying: Lord, it is time, the meal is ready’; but
then, Lord, that slave-woman, having gone to the monastery, saw the monks,
their robes laid aside, letting their bodies get wet with the rain; seeing
them, she thought, ‘There are no monks in the monastery, naked ascetics are
letting their bodies get wet with the rain’. She approached me, having
approached, she spoke thus to me, ‘Lady, there are no monks in the monastery,
naked ascetics are letting their bodies get wet with the rain’. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.417" href="#BD.4.417"></a>
Impure, Lord, is nakedness, it is objectionable’ I, Lord, having this special
reason in mind, want to give for life to the Order cloths for the rains.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.15.8" href="#Kd.8.15.8"></a>
“And again, Lord, an in-coming monk, not accustomed to the roads, not
accustomed to the resorts for alms is (still) walking for alms (when he is)
tired. But having eaten my food for those coming in, (then when) he is
accustomed to the roads, accustomed to the resorts for alms, he will walk for
alms without getting tired. I, Lord, having this special reason in mind, want

<p>“And again, Lord, an out-going monk, while looking about for food for himself,
may be left behind by the caravan, or if he set out tired on a journey he may
arrive at the wrong time at the habitation to which he wishes to go. But having
eaten my food for those going out, he will not be left behind by the caravan,
nor will he set out tired on a journey (and so) he will arrive at the right
time at the habitation to which he wishes to go. I, Lord, having this special
reason in mind, want to give for life to the Order food for those going out.</p>

the disease will not grow very much worse, he will not pass away. I, Lord,

<p>“And again, Lord, a monk who tends the sick, looking about for food for

will miss his meal. But having <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.418" href="#BD.4.418"></a>

“There was a case (where nuns bathed) naked together with prostitutes at the
same ford of the river Aciravatī. Lord, these prostitutes made fun of the nuns,
saying: ‘Why in the world, ladies, is the Brahma-faring led by you while you
are young? Surely the pleasures of the senses should be enjoyed? When you
become old, then you can fare the Brahma-faring; thus will both extremes be
experienced by you.’ Lord, these nuns, being made fun of by these prostitutes,
became ashamed. Impure, Lord, is nakedness for women, it is abhorrent, it is
objectionable. I, Lord, having this special reason in mind, want to give for
life bathing-cloths for the Order of nuns.”</p>

“But having what advantage in mind do you, Visākhā, ask the Truth-finder for
eight boons?”</p>
<p>“Now, Lord, monks who have passed the rains in (various) places will come to
Sāvatthī so as to see the Lord; having approached the Lord, they will ask:
‘Lord, such and such a monk has passed away; what is his bourn, what his future
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.419" href="#BD.4.419"></a>
state?’ The Lord will explain this saying: ‘It is in the fruit of
stream-attaining or it is in the fruit of once-returning or it is in the fruit
of not-returning or it is in the fruit of perfection.’ I, having approached
these, will ask: ‘Honoured sirs, was Sāvatthī previously visited by this
master?’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.15.13" href="#Kd.8.15.13"></a>
“If they say to me: ‘Sāvatthī was previously visited by this monk,’
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.294" href="#Vin.1.294"></a>
I shall come to the conclusion that undoubtedly cloths for the rains or food
for those coming in or food for those going out or food for the sick or food
for those who tend the sick or medicines for the sick or a constant supply of
conjey was enjoyed by this master. On my calling that to mind, delight will be
born; from delight, joy will be born; because my mind is joyful my body will be
calm; with the body calm I will experience ease; because I am at ease my mind
will be contemplative; this will be for me growth as to the sense-organs,
growth as to the powers, growth as to the factors of enlightenment. I, Lord,
having this advantage in mind, am asking the Truth-finder for the eight
boons.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.15.14" href="#Kd.8.15.14"></a>
“It is very good, Visākhā, it is good that you, Visākhā, having this advantage
in mind, are asking the Truth-finder for the eight boons. I allow you, Visākhā,
the eight boons.” Then the Lord blessed Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, with these
verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Whatever (woman), much delighted, endowed with virtue,<br>
a disciple of the well-farer, food and drink</p>

<p>“She gains a deva-like span <br>
owing to the spotless, stainless way,</p>
<p>“She, desiring merit, at ease, healthy, <br>

<p>Then the Lord, having blessed Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, with these verses,
rising from his seat, departed.</p>

Now at that time monks, having eaten abundant food, fell asleep, thoughtless,
careless. While they were sleeping, thoughtless, careless, impurity was emitted
as the result of a dream; the lodging was stained by the impurity. Then the
Lord, as he was touring the lodgings with the venerable Ānanda as his
attendant, saw the lodging stained by impurity; seeing it, he addressed the
venerable Ānanda, saying “Why, Ānanda, is this lodging stained by impurity?”</p>
<p>“Now, Lord, monks <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.295" href="#Vin.1.295"></a>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.16.2" href="#Kd.8.16.2"></a>
“Thus it is, Ānanda, thus it is, Ānanda, that when they fell asleep,
thoughtless, careless, impurity was emitted as the result of a dream. Ānanda,
those monks who fall asleep calling up mindfulness, careful, by these impurity
is not emitted; and, Ānanda, those who are ordinary people, passionless in
regard to pleasures of the senses, by these impurity is not emitted. It is
impossible, it cannot come to pass, Ānanda, that impurity should be emitted by
one perfected.” Then the Lord, on this occasion, having given reasoned talk,
addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Now as I, monks, was touring the lodgings with Ānanda as my attendant, I saw a

Now at that time a (piece of cloth) to sit upon was too small, it did not

Now at that time the venerable Belaṭṭhasīsa, the venerable Ānanda’s preceptor,
came to have a disease of thick scabs. Because of its discharge his robes stuck
to his body; monks laying moistened these again and again with water, loosened
them. The Lord, as he was touring the lodgings, saw these monks loosening these
robes, having moistened them again ind again with water; seeing them, he
approached these monks; having approached, he spoke thus to these monks:</p>

<p>“Lord, this <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.296" href="#Vin.1.296"></a>
venerable one has a disease of thick scabs; because of its discharge his robes

approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, she sat down
at a respectful distance. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.422" href="#BD.4.422"></a>
As she was sitting down at a respectful distance, Visākhā, Migāra’s mother,
spoke thus to the Lord:</p>
<p>“Lord, may the Lord accept from me a cloth for wiping the face, that it may be
for a blessing, a happiness for a long time.”</p>
<p>The Lord accepted the cloth for wiping the face. Then the Lord gladdened,
rejoiced, roused, delighted Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk. Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, having been gladdened … delighted with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk by the Lord, rising up from her seat, having greeted the Lord, departed

Now at that time Roja, the Mallan, was a friend of the venerable Ānanda. A
linen cloth belonging to Roja, the Mallan, was placed in the venerable Ānanda’s
hand, and the venerable Ānanda had need of a linen cloth. They told this matter
to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to take something on trust when it belongs to one endowed

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.20.2" href="#Kd.8.20.2"></a>
Then it occurred to the monks: “Those things that are allowed by the Lord—the

They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to assign as the least robe one that is eight
finger-breadths in length and four finger-breadths wide according to the
accepted finger-breadth.</span>” Now at that time the made-up rag-robes of the venerable Kassapa the Great
became heavy. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to make a rough darn.</span>” It became misshapen at the corner. They told this matter to the Lord. He
said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to pull off the misshapen corner.</span>” The threads were frayed out. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “I

Now at that time much robe-material accrued to a certain monk, and he was
desirous of giving that robe-material to his parents. They told this matter to
the Lord. He said: “Because he is himself giving to his parents, monks, what

Now at that time a certain monk, laying aside a robe in the Blind Men’s Grove,
entered a village for almsfood with (only) his upper and inner robes. Thieves

Monks spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Why are you, your reverence, badly dressed, wearing shabby robes?”</p>
<p>“Now I, your reverences, laying aside a robe in the Blind Men’s Grove, entered

<p>“It is true, your reverences, that it was laid down by the Lord that a village

<p>They told this matter to the Lord.</p>

spent the rains at Sāvatthī, went to a certain village-residence. The monks
were there assembled, wishing to distribute robe-material. They spoke thus to
me: ‘These robes, your reverence, belonging to the Order, will be distributed.
Will you consent (to accept) a portion?’ ‘Yes, your reverences, I will
consent,’ and taking up a portion of the robe-material from there, I went to
another residence. The monks there also assembled, wishing to distribute
robe-material. These also spoke thus to me: ‘These robes, your reverence,
belonging to the Order, will be distributed. Will you consent (to accept) a
portion?’ ‘Yes, your reverences, I will consent,’ and taking up a portion of
the robe-material from there too <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.301" href="#Vin.1.301"></a>
, I went to another residence. The monks there also assembled, wishing to
distribute robe-material. These also spoke thus to me: ‘These robes … a
portion?’ ‘Yes, your reverences, I will consent,’ and I <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.430" href="#BD.4.430"></a>
took up a portion of robe-material from there too. Thus much robe-material
accrued to me.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.25.3" href="#Kd.8.25.3"></a>
“But is it that you, reverend Upananda, having spent the rains somewhere else,
will consent (to accept) a portion of robe-material elsewhere?”</p>
<p>“Yes, your reverences,” he said. Those who were modest monks looked down upon,
criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can the venerable Upananda, the son
of the Sakyans, having spent the rains somewhere else, consent (to accept)
robe-material elsewhere?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Upananda, having spent the rains somewhere
else, consented (to accept) a portion of robe-material elsewhere?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” The awakened one, the Lord rebuked him saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, having spent the rains somewhere else, consent (to
accept) a portion of robe-material elsewhere? It is not, foolish man, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased, nor for increasing (the number of)
those who are pleased.”</p>
<p>Having rebuked him, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, a portion of robe-material is not to be consented to elsewhere by one
who has spent the rains somewhere else. Whoever should consent (to accept),
there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.25.4" href="#Kd.8.25.4"></a>
Now at that time the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, spent the
rains alone in two residences, thinking: “Thus will much robe-material accrue
to me.” Then it occurred to these monks: “Now, how should a share of
robe-material be given to the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans?” They
told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Monks, give one share to the foolish man. For this is a case, monks, where a
monk is spending the rains alone in two residences, thinking, ‘Thus will much
robe-material accrue me’. If he stays half (the time) at one, half (the time)
at the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.431" href="#BD.4.431"></a>
other, half a share of robe-material should be given (to him) at the one, half
at the other; or where he spends the more (time), from there is the share of
the robe-material to be given (to him).”</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.8.26"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.26.1" href="#Kd.8.26.1"></a>
Now at that time a certain monk was suffering from dysentery; he lay fallen in
his own excrements. Then the Lord, as he was touring the lodgings with the
venerable Ānanda as his attendant, approached that monk’s dwelling-place. The
Lord saw that monk lying fallen in his own excrements; seeing him he approached
that monk, and having approached he spoke thus to that monk:</p>
<p>“What is your disease, monk?”</p>
<p>“Lord, I have dysentery.”</p>
<p>“But, monk, have you anyone who tends you?”</p>
<p>“I have not, Lord,” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.302" href="#Vin.1.302"></a>
he said.</p>
<p>“Why do not the monks tend you?”</p>
<p>“I, Lord, am of no use to the monks, therefore the monks do not tend me.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.26.2" href="#Kd.8.26.2"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying: “Go, Ānanda, bring water,
we will bathe this monk.”</p>
<p>“Very well, Lord,” and the venerable Ānanda, having answered the Lord in
assent, when he had brought the water, the Lord sprinkled on the water, the
venerable Ānanda washed him over; the Lord took him by the head, the venerable
Ānanda by the feet, and having raised him up, they laid him down on a couch.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.26.3" href="#Kd.8.26.3"></a>
Then the Lord, on that occasion, in that connection, having had the Order of
monks convened, asked the monks:</p>
<p>“Is there, monks, in such and such a dwelling-place a monk who is ill?”</p>
<p>“There is, Lord.”</p>
<p>“What, monks, is that monk’s disease?”</p>
<p>“Lord, the venerable one has dysentery.”</p>
<p>“But, monks, is there anyone who is tending that monk?”</p>
<p>“There is not, Lord.”</p>
<p>“Why do not the monks tend him?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.432" href="#BD.4.432"></a>
“Lord, this monk is of no use to the monks, therefore the monks do not tend
that monk.”</p>
<p>“Monks, you have not a mother, you have not a father who might tend you. If
you, monks, do not tend one another, then who is there who will tend you?
Whoever, monks, would tend me, he should tend the sick.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.26.4" href="#Kd.8.26.4"></a>
“If he has a preceptor he should be tended for life by the preceptor, who
should wait for his recovery. If he has a teacher he should be tended for life
by the teacher, who should wait for his recovery. If he has one who shares a
dwelling-place … If he has a pupil … If he has a fellow-preceptor … If he has a
fellow-teacher he should be tended for life by the fellow-teacher, who should
wait for his recovery. If he has neither a preceptor nor a teacher nor one who
shares a dwelling-place nor a pupil nor a fellow-preceptor nor a

there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.27.1" href="#Kd.8.27.1"></a>
Now at that time two monks came to be going along a high-road in the Kosala
country. They arrived at a certain residence where a certain monk was ill. Then
it occurred to these monks: “Your reverences, tending the sick is praised by
the Lord. Come, let us tend this monk,” and they tended him. While he was being
tended by them he passed away. Then these monks, taking that monk’s bowl and
robes, having gone to Sāvatthī, told this matter to the Lord.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.27.2" href="#Kd.8.27.2"></a>
He said: “Monks, the Order is the owner of the bowl and robes of a monk who has

Now at that time a certain novice came to pass away. They told this matter to

Now at that time a certain monk and a novice tended one who was ill. While he

“Now what share of the robes is to be given to the novice who tended the one

<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.8.28.1" href="#Kd.8.28.1"></a>
Now at that time a certain monk, having become naked, approached the Lord;
having approached he spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, in many a figure is the
Lord a speaker in praise of desiring little, of contentment, of expunging
(evil), of punctiliousness, of graciousness, of decreasing (the obstructions),
of putting forth energy. Lord, this nakedness is, in many a figure, useful for
desiring little, for contentment, for expunging (evil), for punctiliousness,
for graciousness, for decreasing (the obstructions), for putting forth energy.
It were good, Lord, if the Lord were to allow nakedness for monks.”</p>
<p>The awakened one, the Lord rebuked him, saying: “It is not becoming, it is not
suitable, it is not fitting, it is not worthy of a recluse, it is not
allowable, it is not to be done. How can you, foolish man, observe nakedness,
an observance of members of other sects? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased …”</p>
<p>Having rebuked him, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks saying:

“There are, monks, these eight channels for the accruing of robe-material: if
he gives on a boundary, if he gives on agreement, if he gives with an
announcement of almsfood, if he gives for an Order, if he gives for both
Orders, if he gives for an Order which has spent the rains, if he gives having
offered, if he gives to an individual.</p>
<p>“He gives on a boundary: it should be distributed to as many monks as are
within the boundary.</p>
<p>“He gives on agreement: several residences come to be equal receivers; what is
given in each residence is given for all.</p>
<p>“He gives with an announcement of almsfood: they say, ‘We give it there where
the Order’s constant services are done’.</p>
<p>“He gives for an Order: it should be distributed among the Order that is
present.</p>
<p>“He gives for both Orders: even if there are many monks (but only) one nun, a
half should be given; even if there are many nuns (but only) one monk, a half
should be given.</p>
<p>“He gives for an Order which has spent the rains: it should be distributed to
as many monks as have spent the rains in that residence.</p>
<p>“He gives, having offered: conjeys or rice or solid foods or robes or lodgings
or medicines. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.310" href="#Vin.1.310"></a>
</p>
<p>“He gives to an individual: he says, ‘I am giving this robe-material to so and
so’.”</p>

Urban council of Rājagaha, having seen the courtesan at Vesālī,<br>
having gone back to Rājagaha made this known to the king. / <br>
Indeed Sālavatīka’s child was Abhaya’s son,<br>
known as Jīvaka because the prince asked, “Is he alive?” /<br>
Then he, having gone to Taxila, having studied, very famous,<br>
dispelled a seven year old disease by treatment through the nose, /<br>
He removed the king’s fistula with an ointment
(the king saying), <br>
“Tend me and the women and the awakened one’s Order”. /<br>
And the merchant of Rājagaha, the tending on the twist in the bowels.<br>
He dispelled Pajjota’s great disease by a drink of clarified butter. /<br>
And office, Siveyya(ka cloths), he lubricated the humours,<br>
the purging thirty times all together with three handfuls of lotuses. /<br>
He asked for the boon of good behaviour, and he accepted Siveyya(ka cloths),<br>
and the Truth-finder allowed the gift of householders’ robes. /<br>
Many robes accrued in Rājagaha (and) in the country.<br>
A mantle, and likewise a silken one, a fleecy coverlet, worth half a <i lang="pi">kāsi</i>, /<br>
And various kinds, satisfaction, they did not wait and they waited,<br>
first, afterwards, together, and an agreement, they conveyed it back, /<br>
Store-room, and unguarded, and likewise they turned away,<br>
heaped up, and a tumult. How is it to be divided? How is it to be given? / <br>
About his own and more than one portion. How is a share to be given?<br>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.445" href="#BD.4.445"></a>
With dung and with cold water, to overflow, they did not know, /<br>
Pouring out, and a vessel, and in a dish, and on the ground,<br>
white ants, in the middle, they wore out, on one side, and about being stiff,
/<br>
Harsh, not cut up, laid out in strips, he saw the bundles,<br>
having thought it over the Sakyan sage allowed three robes. /<br>
About another that is extra, it accrued, and then it was torn,<br>
the four quarters, she asked for the boon to give cloths for the rains, /<br>
(Food for) the incoming, the outgoing, the sick, those who tend the sick and
medicine, constant supply, and bathing cloths, abundant, too small, /<br>
Thick scabs, for the face, linen, complete, what is allotted,<br>
the least, it was made heavy, the comer, the thread frayed out, /
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.311" href="#Vin.1.311"></a>
<br>
They gave way, and they were not enough, extra supply, and many,<br>
in the Blind Men’s Grove, through thoughtlessness, the rains alone, and during
a favourable time, /<br>
Two brothers, in Rājagaha, Upananda, again in two,<br>
dysentery, the ill one and the two, on what belongs to the sick, /<br>
Naked one, <i lang="pi">kusa</i>-grass, bark garment, wood shavings, hair blanket,<br>
horse-hair, and owls’ wings, black antelope, and stalks of swallow-wort, /<br>
Fibre, green and yellow, red, and about crimson,<br>
black, brownish-reddish-yellow, then borders not cut up, /<br>
Long, flowers, snakes’ hoods, jackets, Tirīṭa-tree, turbans,<br>
not having accrued, he went away, the Order is divided at all the times, /<br>
They give to a part, for the Order, the venerable Revata sent,<br>
he takes on trust, if he allots, eight channels for robe-material.
