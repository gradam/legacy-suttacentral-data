… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
several monks, (each) wearing (only) one robe, were making robes in a village
residence. Nuns, having entered the monastery without asking (for permission),
approached those monks. The monks … spread it about, saying: “How can nuns
enter a monastery without asking (for permission)?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns … without asking (for permission)?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns enter a monastery without asking (for permission)? It is
not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of
training:</p>
<p><span class="subrule">“Whatever nun should enter a monastery without asking (for permission), there
is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for nuns came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bi-Pc.51.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.51.2.1" href="#Bi-Pc.51.2.1"></a>
Then these monks went out from that residence. The nuns, saying, “The masters
have gone out,” did not go back to the monastery. Then these monks came back
again to that residence. The nuns, saying, “The masters have come back,” having
entered the monastery asking (for permission), approached these monks, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.307" href="#Vin.4.307"></a>
having approached, having greeted these monks, they stood at a respectful
distance. As they were standing at a respectful distance, these monks spoke
thus to these nuns: “Why do you, sisters, neither sweep the monastery nor
provide drinking water and water for washing?”</p>
<p>“Masters, a rule of training came to be laid down by the lord that, without
asking (for permission) a monastery should not be entered (by a nun), therefore
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.341" href="#BD.3.341"></a>
we did not come.” They told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“I allow, monks, (a nun) to enter a monastery asking (for permission) if a monk
be there. And thus, monks, let the nuns set forth this rule of training:</p>
<p><span class="subrule">“Whatever nun should enter a monastery without asking (for permission) if a
monk be there, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for nuns came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bi-Pc.51.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.51.3.1" href="#Bi-Pc.51.3.1"></a>
Then these monks, having gone out from that residence, came back again to that
residence. The nuns, saying, “The masters have gone out,” entered the monastery
without asking (for permission). These became remorseful and said: “A rule of
training laid down by the lord for nuns says that a monastery should not be
entered (by a nun) without asking (for permission) if a monk be there, and we,
not asking (for permission) if a monk was there, entered the monastery. Is it
now possible that we have fallen into an offence of expiation?” They told this
matter to the lord. He said: “And thus, monks, let the nuns set forth this rule
of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should knowingly enter a monastery with monks (in it) without
asking (for permission), there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.51.4.1" href="#Bi-Pc.51.4.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">She knows</span> means:
<span class="gloss">either she knows of herself or others tell her or these tell (her).</span></p>
<p><span class="term">A monastery with monks (in it)</span> means:
<span class="gloss">even where monks stay at the foot of a tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should enter a monastery without asking (for permission)</span> means:
<span class="gloss">without asking a monk or a novice or a monastery attendant (for permission), in
passing beyond the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.342" href="#BD.3.342"></a>
enclosure of a monastery that is fenced in, there is an offence of expiation.
In entering the precincts of a monastery that is not fenced in, there is an
offence of expiation.</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.51.4.2" href="#Bi-Pc.51.4.2"></a>
If she thinks that there are monks (in it) when there are monks (in it) and
enters a monastery without asking (for permission), there is an offence of
expiation. If she is in doubt as to whether monks are (in it) … offence of
wrong-doing. If she thinks that monks are not (in it) when monks are (in it) …
no offence. If she thinks that monks are (in it) when monks are not (in it), <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.308" href="#Vin.4.308"></a>
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether monks are
not (in it), there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that monks are
not (in it) when monks are not (in it), there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.51.4.3" href="#Bi-Pc.51.4.3"></a>
There is no offence if she enters asking (for permission) if a monk be there;
if she enters not asking (for permission) if a monk be not there; if she walks
looking ahead; if she goes where there are nuns gathered together; if (her) way
is through a monastery; if she is ill; if there are accidents; if she is mad,
if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
