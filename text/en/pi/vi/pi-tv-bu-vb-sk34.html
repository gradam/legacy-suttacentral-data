… in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks, eating
almsfood, ate also much curry … “…</p>
<p>‘I will eat almsfood with equal curry,’ is a training to be observed.”</p>
<p><span class="term">Curry</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there are two (kinds of) curry: bean curry, kidney-bean curry, that may be
conveyed by hand.</span> Almsfood with equal curry should be eaten. Whoever out of disrespect eats also
much curry, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>There is no offence if it is unintentional, if he is not thinking, if he does
not know, if he is ill, if it is of another flavour, if it belongs to
relations, if it is offered, if it is by means of his own properties, if there
are accidents, if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
