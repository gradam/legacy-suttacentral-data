… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the venerable Pilindavaccha, desiring to make a cave, had a (mountain) slope
cleared near Rājagaha. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha approached the
venerable Pilindavaccha, and having approached and greeted the venerable
Pilindavaccha, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at
a respectful distance, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha spoke thus to the
venerable Pilindavaccha:</p>
<p>“What, honoured sir, is the elder having made?”</p>
<p>“Sire, desiring to make a cave, I am having a (mountain) slope cleared,” he
said.</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, does the master require an attendant for the monastery?”</p>
<p>“Sire, an attendant for a monastery is not prescribed by the lord.”</p>
<p>“Well, honoured sir, asking the lord, you must tell him of me.”</p>
<p>“Very well, Sire,” the venerable Pilindavaccha answered King Seniya Bimbisāra
of Magadha.</p>
<p>Then the venerable Pilindavaccha taught, roused and gladdened King Seniya
Bimbisāra of Magadha with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk. And when King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha had been taught, roused and
gladdened with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk by the venerable Pilindavaccha, rising up from his seat, greeting the
venerable Pilindavaccha, he departed, keeping his right side towards him.</p>
<p>Then the venerable Pilindavaccha sent a messenger to the lord, to say: “Lord,
King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha desires to present an attendant for a
monastery. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.127" href="#BD.2.127"></a>
Now, lord, what line of conduct is to be followed?”</p>
<p>Then the lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned
talk, addressed the monks, saying: “Monks, I allow an attendant for a
monastery.”</p>
<p>Then a second time did King <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.249" href="#Vin.3.249"></a>
Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha approach the venerable Pilindavaccha, and having
approached and greeted the venerable Pilindavaccha, he sat down at a respectful
distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, King Seniya
Bimbisāra of Magadha spoke thus to the venerable Pilindavaccha:</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, has the lord prescribed an attendant for a monastery?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sire,” he said.</p>
<p>“Well, honoured sir, I will give the master an attendant for the monastery.”</p>
<p>Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, promising the venerable Pilindavaccha an
attendant for the monastery, forgetting (but) remembering after a time,
addressed a chief minister who was concerned with all the affairs, saying: “My
good man, has that attendant for the monastery whom I promised, been given to
the master?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, an attendant for the monastery has not been given to the
master.”</p>
<p>“My good man, how long is it since it was considered?”</p>
<p>“Then that chief minister, counting up the days, spoke thus to King Seniya
Bimbisāra of Magadha: “It is five hundred days, your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“Well then, give five hundred attendants for the monastery to the master.”</p>
<p>“Very well, your Majesty,” and the chief minister, replying thus to King Seniya
Bimbisāra of Magadha, made over to the venerable Pilindavaccha five hundred
attendants for the monastery, and a distinct village <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.128" href="#BD.2.128"></a>
established itself. They even called it “The Village of the Monastery
Attendants,” and they called it Pilinda Village.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.23.1.2" href="#Bu-NP.23.1.2"></a>
Now at that time the venerable Pilindavaccha came to be dependent (for alms) on
the families in this village. Then the venerable Pilindavaccha, dressing in the
morning, taking his bowl and robe, entered Pilinda Village for alms-food. Now
at that time there came to be a festival in this village; young girls wearing
ornaments, adorned with garlands, were celebrating it. Then the venerable
Pilindavaccha, as he was going about in Pilinda Village on continuous
alms-begging, came up to the dwelling of a certain attendant of the monastery,
and having come up he sat down on the appointed seat. Now at that time, the
daughter of the monastery attendant’s wife, seeing other little girls wearing
ornaments, adorned with garlands, cried and said: “Give me a garland, give me
an ornament.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Pilindavaccha said to that monastery attendant’s wife: “Why
is this little girl crying?”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, this little girl is crying because, having seen other little
girls wearing ornaments, adorned with garlands, she says: ‘Give me a garland,
give me an ornament.’ Whence is there a garland for us who are poor, whence is
there an ornament?”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Pilindavaccha, taking a roll of grass, said to that
monastery attendant’s wife: “Now <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.129" href="#BD.2.129"></a>
set this roll of grass on this little girl’s head.” Then that monastery
attendant’s wife, taking that roll of grass, set it on the little girl’s head;
it became a golden chaplet, beautiful, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.250" href="#Vin.3.250"></a>
good to look upon, charming; there was no golden chaplet like it in the women’s
quarters of the king. People said to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha:</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, in the house of a certain monastery attendant there is a golden
chaplet, beautiful, good to look upon, charming; there is no golden chaplet
like it in the women’s quarters of your Majesty. As he is poor, where (could he
have got it) from? Undoubtedly it was taken by theft.”</p>
<p>Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha had that monastery attendant’s family
imprisoned. A second time did the venerable Pilindavaccha, dressing in the
morning, taking his bowl and robe, enter Pilinda Village for alms-food. As he
was going about in Pilinda Village on continuous alms-begging, he came up to
that monastery attendant’s dwelling, and having come up, he asked the
neighbours: “Where has this monastery attendant’s family gone?”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, they have been imprisoned by the king on account of that golden
chaplet,” they said.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.23.1.3" href="#Bu-NP.23.1.3"></a>
Then the venerable Pilindavaccha went up to the residence of King Seniya
Bimbisāra of Magadha, and having gone up he sat down on the appointed seat.
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha approached the venerable Pilindavaccha,
and having approached and greeted the venerable Pilindavaccha, he sat down at a
respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the
venerable Pilindavaccha said to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha: “How is it, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.130" href="#BD.2.130"></a>
Sire, that the monastery attendant’s family is imprisoned?”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, in that monastery attendant’s house there was a golden chaplet,
beautiful, good to look upon, charming; there is no golden chaplet like it in
our women’s quarters. Where (could he have got it) from, as he is poor?
Undoubtedly it was taken by theft.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Pilindavaccha exercised volitional force, and said: “The
palace of King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha is golden,” and it became made all
of gold. He said: “Now, Sire, from where have you got so much gold?”</p>
<p>Saying, “I understand, honoured sir, this is the master’s majesty of psychic
potency,” he set free the monastery attendant’s family. People, delighted, full
of satisfaction because they heard that a state of further-men, a wonder of
psychic potency had been shown by master Pilindavaccha to the king and his
retinue, presented the five kinds of medicine to the venerable Pilindavaccha,
that is to say ghee, fresh butter, oil, honey, molasses. Now the venerable
Pilindavaccha was customarily a receiver, so when he received the five kinds of
medicine he gave them away among his company. And his company came to live in
abundance; whatever they received, filling pots and pitchers, they put them
away, and filling water-strainers and bags, they hung them up in the windows.
These (pots, etc.) were leaking, and the dwelling-places became beset and <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.131" href="#BD.2.131"></a>
overrun by rats.
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.251" href="#Vin.3.251"></a>
People seeing (this) as they were engaged in touring the dwelling-places,
looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “These recluses, sons of
the Sakyans, are storing up goods indoors, like King Seniya Bimbisāra of
Magadha.” Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest
monks … spread it about, saying: “How can monks strive after abundance such as
this?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that monks strive after abundance such as
this?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks, how can these foolish men strive after abundance such as this? It is
not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks,
this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Those medicines which may be partaken of by ill monks, that is to say, ghee,
fresh butter, oil, honey, molasses: accepting these, they may be used as a
store for at most seven days. For him who exceeds that (period), there is an
offence of expiation involving forfeiture.</span>”</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-NP.23.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.23.2.1" href="#Bu-NP.23.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Those medicines which are partaken of by ill monks</span> means:
<span class="gloss">
<span class="term"><em>ghee</em></span> is called
<span class="gloss">ghee from cows or ghee from <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.132" href="#BD.2.132"></a>she-goats or ghee from buffaloes; ghee from those whose meat is suitable.</span>
<span class="term">Fresh butter</span> means:
<span class="gloss">fresh butter from just these.</span>
<span class="term">Oil</span> means:
<span class="gloss">sesamum oil, oil of mustard seeds, oil containing honey, oil of the castor-oil
plant, oil from tallow.</span>
<span class="term">Honey</span> means:
<span class="gloss">honey of bees.</span>
<span class="term">Molasses</span> means:
<span class="gloss">what is produced from sugar-cane.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="term">Accepting these, they may be used as a store for at most seven days</span> means:
<span class="gloss">they may be used for seven days at the maximum.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">For him who exceeds that (period) there is an offence involving forfeiture</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is to be forfeited on the eighth day at sunrise. It should be forfeited to …
an individual. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, seven days having elapsed, this medicine of mine is to be
forfeited. I forfeit it to the Order.’</span> …
<span class="kamma">‘… the Order should give back … let the venerable ones give back … May I give
back this medicine to the venerable one?’</span></span></p>
<p>If he thinks that seven days have elapsed when they have elapsed, there is an
offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he is in doubt as to whether the
seven days have elapsed, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.
If he thinks that the seven days have elapsed when they have not elapsed, there
is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that it is
allotted when it is not allotted, there is an offence of expiation involving
forfeiture. If he thinks that it is bestowed when it is not bestowed … If he
thinks that it is lost when it is not lost … If he thinks that it is destroyed
when it is not destroyed … <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.252" href="#Vin.3.252"></a>
If he thinks that it is burnt when it is not burnt, there is an offence of
expiation involving forfeiture. If <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.133" href="#BD.2.133"></a>
he thinks that it is stolen when it is not stolen, there is an offence of
expiation involving forfeiture.</p>
<p>Acquiring something that has been forfeited, it must not be made use of for
bodily enjoyment, it must not be consumed, it may be done into a lamp or black
colour, it may be made use of by another monk for bodily enjoyment, it must not
be consumed (by him). If he thinks that the seven days have not elapsed when
they have elapsed, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to
whether the seven days have not elapsed, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If
he thinks that the seven days have not elapsed when they have not elapsed,
there is no offence.</p>
<p>There is no offence if within seven days it is allotted, bestowed, lost,
destroyed, burnt; if they tear it from them; if they take it on trust; if it is
sacrificed, renounced, given up to one who is not ordained; if one devoid of
longing, giving (and) acquiring, makes use of it; if he is mad, if he is the
first wrong-doer.</p>
