… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. At that time the
group of six monks said: “It is forbidden by the lord to have a rug made of
pure black sheep’s wool.” And these, taking only a little white for the seam,
all the same had a rug made of pure black sheep’s wool. Those who were modest
monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this group of six monks, taking only a little white for the seam, all
the same have a rug made of pure black sheep’s wool?” Then these monks told
this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, taking only a little white for the
seam, all the same had a rug made of pure black sheep’s wool?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, taking … pure black sheep’s wool? It is not, foolish
men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule
of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">When a new rug is being made for a monk, two portions of pure black sheep’s
wool may be taken, the third of white, the fourth of reddish brown colours. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.77" href="#BD.2.77"></a>
If a monk should cause a new rug to be made not taking two portions of pure
black sheep’s wool, the third of white, the fourth of reddish brown colours,
there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>

<span class="term">New</span> means:

<p><span class="term">If a monk … not taking two portions of pure black sheep’s wool, the third of
white, the fourth of reddish brown colours</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he makes or causes a new rug to be made not taking a
<i lang="pi">tulā</i>, weight of white, a <i lang="pi">tulā</i>, weight of reddish brown colours, there is an offence of wrong-doing in the
action; it should be forfeited on acquisition. It should be forfeited to … an
individual. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, this rug which I caused to be made not taking a <i lang="pi">tulā</i> weight of white, a <i lang="pi">tulā</i> weight of reddish brown colours, is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to the
Order.’</span> …
<span class="kamma">‘… the Order should give back … let them give back … I will give back this rug
to the venerable one.’</span></span></p>
<p>If what was incompletely executed by himself, he has finished by himself … <span class="add">See <a class="cr" href="#Bu-NP.11.2.2">Bu-NP.11.2.2</a></span> … he makes use of it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>There is no offence if he makes it taking a
<i lang="pi">tulā</i> weight of white, a <i lang="pi">tulā</i> weight of reddish brown colours; if he
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.78" href="#BD.2.78"></a>
makes it taking more of white, more of reddish brown colours; if he makes it
taking only of white, only of reddish brown colours; if he makes a canopy or a
ground-covering or a screen-wall or a mattress or a squatting-mat; if he is
mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
