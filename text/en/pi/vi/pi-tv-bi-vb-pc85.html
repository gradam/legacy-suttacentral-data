… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six nuns went in a vehicle. People … spread it about, saying: “How
can these nuns go in a vehicle, like women householders who enjoy pleasures of
the senses?” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were
modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six nuns go in a
vehicle?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six nuns went in a vehicle?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can this group of six nuns go in a vehicle? It is not, monks, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.339" href="#Vin.4.339"></a>
</p>
<p><span class="subrule">“Whatever nun should go in a vehicle, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for nuns came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.85.1.2" href="#Bi-Pc.85.1.2"></a>
Now at that time a certain nun came to be ill. She was not able to go on foot.
They told this matter to the lord. He said: “I allow, monks, a vehicle for a
nun who is ill. And thus, monks … this rule of training:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.403" href="#BD.3.403"></a>
“<span class="rule">Whatever nun who is not ill should go in a vehicle, there is an offence of
expiation.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bi-Pc.85.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.85.2.1" href="#Bi-Pc.85.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Not ill</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she is able to go on foot.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Ill</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she is not able to go on foot.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Vehicle</span> means:
<span class="gloss">a cart, a carriage, a waggon, a chariot, a palanquin, or a sedan chair.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should go</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if she goes even once, there is an offence of expiation</span>.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.85.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.85.2.2"></a>
If she thinks that she is not ill when she is not ill (and) goes in a vehicle,
there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as to whether she is not
ill … If she thinks that she is ill when she is not ill … offence of expiation.
If she thinks that she is not ill when she is ill, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether she is ill, there is an offence
of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is ill when she is ill, there is no
offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.85.2.3" href="#Bi-Pc.85.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she is ill; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if
she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
