… in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks, having
dressed themselves, including their heads, in the upper robes, went (sat down)
amidst the houses … “…</p>
<p>‘Not muffled up will I go (sit down) amidst the houses,’ is a training to be

disrespect goes (sits down) <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.126" href="#BD.3.126"></a>

robe, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>There is no offence … <span class="add"><em>as in
