<h1>Monks’ Expulsion 2: Theft</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<h3>First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.2"></a> <a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.2.1"></a> <a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.1"></a> <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.64"></a> <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.41"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.191"></a> At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture’s Peak. At that time a number of monks who were friends had made grass huts on the slope of Mount Isigili and had entered the rains there. Among them was Venerable Dhaniya, the potter’s son. After three months, when the rains residence was over, the monks demolished their grass huts, put away the grass and wood, and departed to wander around the country. But Venerable Dhaniya also spent the winter and the summer there. Then, while Venerable Dhaniya was in the village collecting alms, some women gathering grass and firewood demolished the grass hut and took away the grass and sticks. A second time Venerable Dhaniya collected grass and sticks and made a grass hut, and again the hut was demolished in the same way. The same thing happened a third time.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.192"></a> Venerable Dhaniya thought, “Three times <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.65"></a> this has happened. But I am well-trained and experienced in my own craft, the potter’s craft. Perhaps I should knead mud myself and make a hut consisting of nothing but clay?” <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.193"></a> Then Venerable Dhaniya <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.42"></a> did just that. And he collected grass, wood, and cow-dung, and he baked his hut. It was a beautiful, lovely, and charming little hut, and it was red just like a scarlet rain-mite. And (when hit) it sounded just like the sound of a bell.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.2"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.194"></a> Just then the Master, descending from Mount Vulture’s Peak with a number of monks, saw that hut. He then addressed the monks: “Monks, what is this beautiful, lovely, and charming thing, which is red like a scarlet rain-mite?” And the monks informed the Master. The Buddha, the Master, was critical, saying:</p>
<p>“It’s not suitable, monks, for that foolish man, it’s not becoming, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could he make a hut out of nothing but clay? Certainly that foolish man can have no consideration, compassion, and mercy for living beings. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.66"></a> Go, monks, and demolish this hut. Do not let future generations take up the destruction of living beings. <span class="rule">And, monks, a hut consisting of nothing but clay should not be made. If one does, there is an offence of bad conduct.</span>”</p>
<p>“Yes, bhante,” the monks replied, and they went to that hut and <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.67"></a> demolished it.</p>
<p>Venerable Dhaniya said to them: “Why are you demolishing my hut?”</p>
<p>“The Master has asked us to.”</p>
<p>“Demolish it, if the Lord of the Dhamma has said so.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.3"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.195"></a> Then Venerable Dhaniya thought: “Three times, while I was in the village collecting alms, some women gathering grass and firewood demolished my hut and took away the grass and sticks. And now my hut made of nothing but clay has been demolished at the Master’s request. But the overseer of the wood-yard is a friend of mine. Perhaps I should ask him for wood and make a hut out of that?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.196"></a> And Venerable Dhaniya went to the overseer of the wood-yard and told him what had happened, adding, “Give me some wood, I want to make a wooden hut.”</p>
<p>“There is no such wood, bhante, that I could give you. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.43"></a> This wood is held by the king, and it’s meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of emergency. Only if the king gives it may you take it.”</p>
<p>“It has been given by the king.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.197"></a> The overseer of the wood-yard thought: “These ascetics, the sons of the Sakyan, are followers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, of just conduct, committed to the spiritual life, speakers of truth, virtuous, of good conduct. Even the king has faith in them. He would not say something is given if it were not.” Then he said to Venerable Dhaniya: <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.68"></a> “You may take it, bhante.” Then Venerable Dhaniya had that wood broken up into pieces, removed it by means of carts, and made a wooden hut.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.4"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.198"></a> Soon afterwards the brahmin Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, while inspecting the works in Rājagaha, went to the overseer of the wood-yard and said to him: “What’s going on? Where’s the wood held by the king that’s meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of emergency?”</p>
<p>“Sir, that wood was given by the king to Venerable Dhaniya.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.199"></a> The brahmin Vassakāra was upset and thought: “How could the king give away the wood, which is meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of emergency, to Dhaniya, the potter’s son?”</p>
<p>The brahmin Vassakāra then went to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and said: “Is it true, sire, that the wood held by the king, meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of emergency, was given by the king to Dhaniya, the potter’s son?”</p>
<p>“Who said that?”</p>
<p>“The overseer of the wood-yard, sire.”</p>
<p>“Well then, brahmin, send for the overseer of the wood-yard.” And Vassakāra had the overseer of the wood-yard bound and taken by force.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.200"></a> Venerable Dhaniya saw the overseer of the wood-yard being <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.69"></a> bound and taken by force, and he said to him: “Why is this happening to you?”</p>
<p>“Because of the business with that wood, bhante.”</p>
<p>“Go, and I too will come.”</p>
<p>“Please come before I am done for, bhante.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.5"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.201"></a> Venerable Dhaniya then went to the dwelling of King Bimbisāra and sat down on the appointed seat. King Bimbisāra approached Venerable Dhaniya, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.44"></a> paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. King Bimbisāra then said: “Is it true, bhante, that the wood held by the king, meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of emergency, has been given by me to the Venerable?”</p>
<p>“Yes, great king.”</p>
<p>“We kings are very busy—having given, we may not remember. Please remind me, bhante.”</p>
<p>“Do you remember, great king, when you were first anointed, speaking these words: ‘Let the ascetics and brahmins enjoy gifts of grass, sticks, and water’?”</p>
<p>“I remember, bhante. There are ascetics and brahmins who have a sense of shame, are scrupulous, and desirous of training. They have a sense of conscience even in regard to small matters. What was uttered by me was meant for these, and it concerned what is ownerless in the wilderness. Yet you, bhante, imagine you can take wood not given to you by means of this trick? But how could I presume to beat, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.70"></a> imprison, or banish an ascetic or a brahmin living in my kingdom? Go, you are free because of your status, but do not do such a thing again.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.6"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.202"></a> But people grumbled and complained: “These ascetics, the sons of the Sakyan, are shameless, immoral, and liars. They claim to be followers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, of just conduct, committed to the spiritual life, speakers of truth, virtuous, of good conduct. But they don’t have the qualities of an ascetic or a brahmin; they have lost their way. They even deceive the king; what then other people?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.203"></a> Monks heard the criticism of those people. Those monks who had few desires and a sense of shame, who were contented, scrupulous, and desirous of training, complained and criticised Venerable Dhaniya: “How can he take wood belonging to the king that has not been given to him?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.204"></a>They informed the Master. The Master then convened the Sangha and questioned Venerable Dhaniya: “Is it true, Dhaniya, that you have taken wood belonging to the king that was not given to you?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.71"></a> The Buddha, the Master, rebuked him: “Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it is not becoming, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could you <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.45"></a> take wood belonging to the king that had not been given to you? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it, nor increase the confidence of those who have it, but it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.205"></a> At that time a certain former chief justice who had gone forth among the monks was sitting near the Master. The Master said to him: “For what amount of theft does King Bimbisāra beat, imprison, or banish a thief?”</p>
<p>“For a <i lang="pi">pāda</i>, Master, for the worth of a <i lang="pi">pāda</i>, or for more than a <i lang="pi">pāda</i>.” At that time in Rājagaha a <i lang="pi">pāda</i> was worth <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.72"></a> five <i lang="pi">māsakas</i>.</p>
<p>The Master, having rebuked Venerable Dhaniya in many ways for being difficult to support … “… And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3>Preliminary ruling</h3>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.206"></a> <span class="subrule">“If a monk, intending to steal, takes what has not been given to him—the sort of theft for which kings, having caught a thief, would beat, imprison, or banish him, saying, ‘You are a robber, you are foolish, you have gone astray, you are a thief’—he too is expelled and not in communion.”</span></p>
<p class="end"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.207"></a> In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3>Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.2.2"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.208"></a> At one time some monks belonging to the group of six went to the dyers’ spread (of dyed cloth), took the dyers’ goods to the monastery and shared it out. Other monks said: “You have great merit, since you have obtained so many robes.”</p>
<p>“How is there merit for us? Just now we went to the dyers’ spread (of dyed cloth) and took the dyers’ goods.”</p>
<p>“Hasn’t a training rule been laid down by the Master? Why then do you take the dyers’ goods?”</p>
<p>“It is true that a training rule has been laid down by the Master, but it concerns the village, not the wilderness.”</p>
<p>“But that’s just the same. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.73"></a> It’s not suitable, it’s not becoming, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How can you take the dyers’s goods? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it, nor increase the confidence of those who have it, but it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.”</p>
<p>Having rebuked those monks in various ways, they <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.46"></a> informed the Master. <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.209"></a> The Master convened the Sangha and questioned those monks: “Is it true, monks, that you went to the dyers’ spread (of dyed cloth) and took the dyers’ goods?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked them: “It’s not suitable, foolish men, it is not becoming, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could you go to the dyers’ spread (of dyed cloth) and take the dyers’ goods? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … to change their minds.” Then the Master, after rebuking those monks belonging to the group of six in various ways, spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … but he spoke in praise … of putting forth energy. Having given a Dhamma talk on what is right and seemly, he addressed the monks … “… And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.210"></a> “If a monk, intending to steal, takes from a village or from the wilderness what has not been given to him—the sort of theft for which kings, having caught a thief, would beat, imprison, or banish him, saying, ‘You are a robber, you are foolish, you have gone astray, you are a thief’—he too is expelled and not in communion.”</p>

<p>Then a woman cowherd who had seen him crossing said, “Come, bhante, have sexual intercourse.” Thinking, “I am no longer an ascetic,” he had sexual intercourse with her.</p>
