<a class="ms-pa" id="MS.191" href="#MS.191"></a>
At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture’s
Peak. Now at that time a number of monks who were friends made grass huts on
the slope of Mount Isigili and entered the rains there. Among them was
Venerable Dhaniya, the potter’s son. Then, after three months, when the rains
(residence) was over, the monks demolished their grass huts, put away the grass
and wood and departed to wander around the country. But Venerable Dhaniya spent
the rains there, and the winter and the summer. Then, while Venerable Dhaniya
was in the village collecting alms, women gathering grass and firewood
demolished the grass hut and took away the grass and sticks. A second time
Venerable Dhaniya collected grass and sticks and made a grass hut. A second
time, while Venerable Dhaniya was in the village collecting alms, women
gathering grass and firewood demolished the grass hut and took away the grass
and sticks. And the same thing happened a third time. <a class="ms-pa" id="MS.192" href="#MS.192"></a>
Then Venerable Dhaniya thought: “Three times
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.65" href="#BD.1.65"></a>
this has happened. But I am well-trained and experienced in my own craft, the
potter’s craft. Perhaps I should knead mud myself and make a hut consisting of
nothing but clay?” <a class="ms-pa" id="MS.193" href="#MS.193"></a>
Then Venerable Dhaniya
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.42" href="#Vin.3.42"></a>
did just that. He then collected grass, wood and cow-dung and baked his hut. It
was a beautiful, lovely and charming little hut, and it was red just like a
scarlet rain-mite. And (when hit) it sounded just like the sound of a bell.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.2" href="#Bu-Pj.2.1.2"></a>
<a class="ms-pa" id="MS.194" href="#MS.194"></a>
Then the Master, descending from Mount Vulture’s Peak with a number of monks,
saw the hut. He then addressed the monks:</p>
<p>“Monks, what is this beautiful, lovely and charming thing, which is red like a
scarlet rain-mite?” The monks then informed the Master. The Buddha, the Master,
was critical, saying:</p>
<p>“It is not suitable, monks, for that foolish man, it is not fit, it is not
becoming, it is not worthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it should not be
done. For how could that foolish man make a hut out of nothing but clay?
Certainly this foolish man can have no consideration, compassion and mercy for
living beings. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.66" href="#BD.1.66"></a>
Go, monks, and demolish this hut. Do not let future generations take up the
destruction of living beings. <span class="rule">And, monks, a hut consisting of nothing but clay should not be made. If one
does, there is an offence of bad conduct.</span>”</p>
<p>“Yes, bhante,” the monks replied, and they went to that hut and <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.67" href="#BD.1.67"></a>
demolished it. Then Venerable Dhaniya said to those monks:</p>
<p>“Why, friends, are you demolishing my hut?”</p>
<p>“Friend, the Master has asked us to.”</p>
<p>“Demolish it, friends, if the Lord of the Dhamma has said so.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.3" href="#Bu-Pj.2.1.3"></a>
<a class="ms-pa" id="MS.195" href="#MS.195"></a>
Then Venerable Dhaniya thought: “Three times, while I was in the village
collecting alms, women gathering grass and firewood demolished my hut and took
away the grass and sticks. And now my hut made of nothing but clay has been
demolished at the Master’s request. Now the overseer of the wood-yard is a
friend of mine. Perhaps I should ask him for wood and make a hut out of it?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.196" href="#MS.196"></a>
Then Venerable Dhaniya approached the overseer of the wood-yard and said this:
“Three times, friend, while I was in the village collecting alms, women
gathering grass and firewood … has been demolished at the Master’s request.
Give me some wood, friend, I want to make a wooden hut.”</p>
<p>“There is no such wood, bhante, that I could give you. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.43" href="#Vin.3.43"></a>
This wood is held by the king, and it is meant for the repair of the town and
put aside in case of emergency. Only if the king gives it, may you take it.”</p>
<p>“Friend, it has been given by the king.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.197" href="#MS.197"></a>
Then the overseer of the wood-yard thought: “These recluses, sons of the
Sakyan, are followers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, of just conduct, committed to the spiritual life, speakers of truth,
virtuous, of good conduct. Even the king has faith in these. He would not say
something is given if it were not.” Then the overseer of the wood-yard said to
Venerable Dhaniya <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.68" href="#BD.1.68"></a>
: “You may take it, bhante.” Then Venerable Dhaniya had that wood broken up
into pieces, removed it by means of carts and made a wooden hut.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.4" href="#Bu-Pj.2.1.4"></a>
<a class="ms-pa" id="MS.198" href="#MS.198"></a>
Now the brahmin Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, while he was
inspecting the works in Rājagaha, went to the overseer of the wood-yard and
said to him: “What is going on: where is the wood held by the king that is
meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of emergency?”</p>
<p>“Sir, that wood was given by the king to master Dhaniya.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.199" href="#MS.199"></a>
Then the brahmin Vassakāra was upset: “How could the king give away the wood,
which is meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of emergency,
to Dhaniya, the potter’s son?”</p>
<p>Then the brahmin Vassakāra went to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and said to
him: “Is it true, sire, that the wood held by the king, meant for the repair of
the town and put aside in case of emergency, were given by the king to Dhaniya,
the potter’s son?”</p>
<p>“Who said that?”</p>
<p>“The overseer of the wood-yard, sire.”</p>
<p>“Well then, brahmin, send for the overseer of the wood-yard.” Then Vassakāra
had the overseer of the wood-yard bound and taken by force.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.200" href="#MS.200"></a>
Venerable Dhaniya saw the overseer of the wood-yard being
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.69" href="#BD.1.69"></a>
bound and taken by force and said to him: “Friend, why is this happening to
you?”</p>
<p>“Because of the business with that wood, bhante.”</p>
<p>“Go, friend, and I too will come.”</p>
<p>“Please come before I am done for, bhante.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.5" href="#Bu-Pj.2.1.5"></a>
<a class="ms-pa" id="MS.201" href="#MS.201"></a>
Then Venerable Dhaniya went to the dwelling of King Bimbisāra and sat down on
the appointed seat. Then King Bimbisāra approached Venerable Dhaniya, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.44" href="#Vin.3.44"></a>
paid homage to him and sat down to one side. King Bimbisāra then said this to
him:</p>
<p>“Is it true, bhante, that the wood held by the king, meant for the repair of
the town and put aside in case of emergency, have been given by me to the
master?”</p>
<p>“Yes, great king.”</p>
<p>“We kings are very busy—having given, we may not remember. Please remind me,
bhante.”</p>
<p>“Do you remember, great king, when you were first anointed, speaking these
words: ‘Let the recluses and brahmins enjoy gifts of grass, sticks and
water’?”</p>
<p>“I remember, bhante. There are recluses and brahmins who have a sense of shame,
are scrupulous and desirous of training. They have a sense of conscience even
in regard to small matters. What was uttered by me was meant for these, and it
concerned what is ownerless in the wilderness. Yet you, bhante, imagine you can
take wood not given to you by means of this trick? But how could one like me
flog, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.70" href="#BD.1.70"></a>
imprison or banish a recluse or a brahmin living in my kingdom? Go, you are
free because of your status, but do not do such a thing again.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.6" href="#Bu-Pj.2.1.6"></a>
<a class="ms-pa" id="MS.202" href="#MS.202"></a>
People criticised and denounced him: “These recluses, the sons of the Sakyan,
are shameless, immoral, liars. They claim to be followers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, of just conduct, committed to the spiritual life, speakers of truth,
virtuous, of good conduct. But there is no recluseship or brahminhood among
these—it is lost to them. Where is recluseship and brahminhood among them? They
have departed from it. They even deceive the king; what then other people?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.203" href="#MS.203"></a>
Monks heard the criticism of those people. Those monks who had few desires and
a sense of shame, who were contented, scrupulous, and desirous of training,
criticised and denounced Venerable Dhaniya: “How could he take wood belonging
to the king that had not been given to him?” <a class="ms-pa" id="MS.204" href="#MS.204"></a>
Then these monks informed the Master. And in this connection the Master
convened the Sangha of monks and questoned Venerable Dhaniya:</p>
<p>“Is it true, Dhaniya, that you have taken wood belonging to the king that was
not given to you?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Master.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.71" href="#BD.1.71"></a>
The Buddha, the Master, rebuked him: “Foolish man, it is not suitable, it is
not becoming, it is not proper, it is not worthy of a recluse, it is not
allowable, it is not to be done. How could you <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.45" href="#Vin.3.45"></a>
take wood belonging to the king that has not been given to you? This will not
give rise to confidence in those without it, nor increase the confidence of
those who have it, but it will hinder confidence in those without it and it
will cause some with confidence to change their minds.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.205" href="#MS.205"></a>
Now at that time a certain former chief minister of justice who had gone forth
among the monks was sitting near the Master. The Master said to him: “For what
amount of theft, monk, does King Bimbisāra flog, imprison or banish a thief?”</p>
<p>“For a <i lang="pi">pāda</i>, Master, for the worth of a <i lang="pi">pāda</i>, or for more than a <i lang="pi">pāda</i>.”</p>
<p>Now at that time in Rājagaha a
<i lang="pi">pāda</i> was worth
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.72" href="#BD.1.72"></a>
five <i lang="pi">māsakas</i>. Then the Master, having rebuked Venerable Dhaniya in several ways for being
difficult to support … “… And, monks, this training rule should be recited
thus:</p>
<h3>Preliminary ruling</h3>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.206" href="#MS.206"></a>
<span class="subrule">“If a monk takes by way of theft what has not been given to him—the sort of
theft for which kings, having caught a thief, would flog, imprison or banish
him, saying, ‘You are a robber, you are foolish, you have gone astray, you are
a thief’—he too is expelled and not in communion.”</span></p>
<p class="end"><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.207" href="#MS.207"></a>
Thus the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3>Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.2.2" href="#Bu-Pj.2.2"></a>
<a class="ms-pa" id="MS.208" href="#MS.208"></a>
At one time the group of six monks went to the dyers’ spread (of dyed cloth),
carried off the dyers’ goods, took it to the monastery and divided it out.
Other monks said:</p>
<p>“Friends, you have great merit, for many robes have accrued to you.”</p>
<p>“How is there merit for us, friends? Just now we went to the dyers’ spread (of
dyed cloth) and carried off the dyers’ goods.”</p>
<p>“Friends, hasn’t a training rule been laid down by the Master? Why then do you
carry off the dyers’ goods?”</p>
<p>“It is true, friends, that a training rule has been laid down by the Master,
but it concerns the village, not the wilderness.”</p>
<p>“But, friends, that is just the same. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.73" href="#BD.1.73"></a>
It is not suitable, it is not becoming, it is not proper, it is not worthy of a
recluse, it is not allowable, it should not be done. How could you carry off
the dyers’s goods? It will not give rise to confidence in those without it, nor
increase the confidence of those who have it, but it will hinder confidence in
those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their
minds.”</p>
<p>Then those monks, having rebuked the group of six monks in various ways,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.46" href="#Vin.3.46"></a>
informed the Master.
<a class="ms-pa" id="MS.209" href="#MS.209"></a>
And in this connection the Master convened the Sangha and questoned the group
of six monks:</p>
<p>“Is it true, monks, that you went the dyers’ spread (of dyed cloth) and carried
off the dyers’ goods?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked them: “it is not suitable, foolish men, it is
not becoming, it is not proper, it is not worthy of a recluse, it is not
allowable, it should not be done. How could you go to the dyers’ spread (of
dyed cloth) and carry off the dyers’ goods? It will not give rise to confidence
in those without it … to change their minds.” Then the Master, rebuking the
group of six monks in various ways, spoke in dispraise of being difficult to
support … but he spoke in praise … of the putting forth of energy. Having given
a <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> talk on what was right and seemly, he addressed the monks … “… And so, monks,
this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.210" href="#MS.210"></a>

communion.”</p>

who have been kidnapped by thieves?” They informed the Master. He said: <span class="subrule">“Monks, there is no offence in the area of psychic powers for one who possesses
them.”</span></p>

At one time the two monks Paṇḍaka and Kapila were friends. One lived in a
village and one at Kosambī. Then, while the first monk was going from the
village to Kosambī, as he was crossing a river, a lump of fat that had escaped
from the hands of pork-butchers stuck to his foot. He took hold of it,
thinking, “I will give it to the owners.” The owners reprimanded him, saying,
“You are no longer a recluse.”</p>
<p>Then a woman cowherd who had seen him crossing said, “Come, bhante, have sexual
intercourse.” Thinking, “I am no longer a recluse,” he had sexual intercourse
with her.</p>
<p>When he arrived in Kosambī, he informed the monks and they informed the Master.
He said, “Monks, there is no offence entailing expulsion for stealing, but
there is an offence entailing expulsion for having sexual intercourse.”</p>

Now at that time at Sāgalā, a monk who was the disciple of Venerable Daḷhika,
being tormented by <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.114" href="#BD.1.114"></a>
discontent, took a turban from a shopkeeper. He then said to Venerable Daḷhika,
“Bhante, I am no longer a recluse, I will leave the Sangha.”</p>
<p>“But what have you done, friend?” He told him. Having had the turban brought,
Venerable Daḷhika valued it, and it was not worth five <i lang="pi">māsakas</i>. “Friend, there is no offence entailing expulsion,” and he gave a talk on the <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i>. That monk was delighted.</p>

The second offence entailing expulsion is finished.</p>
