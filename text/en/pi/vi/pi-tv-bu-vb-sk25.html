… in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks, crouching down on their heels, went amidst the houses … “…</p>
<p>‘Not crouching down on the heels will I go amidst the houses,’ is a training to be observed.”</p>
<p>One should not go amidst the houses crouching down on the heels. Whoever out of disrespect goes amidst the houses crouching down on the heels, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>There is no offence if it is unintentional … if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
