… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
an itch-cloth was allowed to the monks by the lord. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.172" href="#Vin.4.172"></a>
The group of six monks, thinking: “An itch-cloth is allowed by the lord,” used
itch-cloths that were not of a (proper) measure; they went about trailing
(these) along in front as well as behind. Those who were modest monks … spread
it about, saying: “How can this group of six monks use itch-cloths that are not
of a (proper) measure” …</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, use itch-cloths that are not of a (proper) measure?
It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And
thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">When an itch-cloth is being made for a monk, it must be made to a (proper)
measure. This is the (proper) measure here: in length four spans of the
accepted span, in breadth two spans. In exceeding this (measure), there is an
offence of expiation involving cutting down.”</span></p>
