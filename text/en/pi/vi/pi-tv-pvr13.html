The one who is reproving should be asked by an adjudicator: “That monk whom you
are reproving, reverend sir, for what are you reproving him? Are you reproving
him for falling away from moral habit, are you reproving him for falling away
from right behaviour, are you reproving him for falling away from right view?”
If he should speak thus: “I am reproving him for falling away from moral habit,
or I am reproving him for falling away from right behaviour, or I am reproving
him for falling away from right view,” he should be spoken to thus: “But does
your reverence know … <span class="add">

<em>Instead of</em> if you suspend this monk’s Invitation
<em>read</em> I reprove, you reprove</span> … Did you suspect, having heard from disciples of (other) sects?”</p>

If the seen corresponds with the seen,<br>
the seen being in agreement with the seen, <br>
If concerning the seen he does not consent, <br>
he is one suspecting impurity:<br>
That man, on his acknowledgement, <br>
may carry out Observance with him.</p>
<p>If the heard corresponds with the heard,<br>
the heard being in agreement with the heard,<br>
If concerning the heard … <br>
Observance with him.</p>
<p>If the sensed corresponds with the sensed,<br>
the sensed being in agreement with the sensed,<br>
If concerning the sensed … <br>
Observance with him.</p>

What is the beginning of reproving, what is in the middle what is the ending?
Giving leave is the beginning of reproving, carrying out is in the middle, a
decision is the ending.</p>
<p>How many roots of reproving, how many matters, how many (mental) planes? In how
many ways does one reprove? Two roots of reproving, three matters, five
(mental) planes He reproves in two ways.</p>
<p>What are the two roots of reproving? With root, or rootless. These are the two
roots of reproving.</p>
<p>What are the three matters for reproving? About the seen the heard, the
suspected. These are the three matters for reproving.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.5.161" href="#Vin.5.161"></a>
What are the five (mental) planes for reproving? “I will speak at a right time,
not at a wrong time; I will speak about fact, not about what is not fact; I
will speak gently, not harshly; I will speak about what is connected with the
goal, not about what is not connected with the goal; I will speak with a mind
of loving-kindness, not with inner hatred.” These are the five (mental) planes
for reproving.</p>
<p>What are the two ways by which he reproves? He reproves by body and he reproves
by speech. These are the two ways by which he reproves.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.13.1.4" href="#Prv.13.1.4"></a>
What should be practised by one who is reproving … by one who is being reproved
… by an Order … by an adjudicator?</p>
<p>What should be practised by one who is reproving? Another may be reproved by a
reprover who is firm in five things: “I will speak at a right time, not at a
wrong time … I will speak with a mind of loving-kindness, not with inner
hatred.” Thus should it be practised by one who is reproving.</p>
<p>What should be practised by one who is being reproved? In two things should one
who is being reproved practice: in the truth and in being without anger. Thus
should it be practised by one who is being reproved.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.261" href="#BD.6.261"></a>
What should be practised by an Order? What has been said already and what has
not been said should be known by an Order. Thus should it be practised by an
Order.</p>
<p>What should be practised by an adjudicator? As that legal question is settled
by an adjudicator according to rule, according to Discipline, according to the
Teacher’s Dispensation, so should he settle this legal question. Thus should it
be practised by an adjudicator.</p>

For what purpose is Observance,<br>
by reason of what is there Invitation,<br>
For what purpose is probation,<br>
by reason of what is there sending back to the beginning,<br>
For what purpose is <i lang="pi">mānatta</i>,<br>
by reason of what is there rehabilitation?</p>
<p>Observance is for “being all together”,<br>
for purity there is Invitation,<br>
Probation is for <i lang="pi">mānatta</i>,<br>
sending back to the beginning is for restraint,<br>
<i lang="pi">Mānatta</i> is for rehabilitation,<br>
for purity there is rehabilitation.</p>
<p>If he abuses Elders for (having) <br>
partiality, hatred, fear, confusion:<br>
At the breaking up of the body, weak in wisdom,<br>
done for, faculties destroyed,<br>
He goes to Niraya, the stupid fool <br>
who has no reverence for the trainings.</p>
<p>Not depending on things of the world <br>
nor depending on an individual,<br>
Abandoning both of these,<br>
he should be dealt with according to the rule.</p>
