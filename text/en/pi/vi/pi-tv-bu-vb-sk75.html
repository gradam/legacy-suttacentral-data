… in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks eased
themselves and spat in the water. People … <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.206" href="#Vin.4.206"></a>
spread it about, saying: “How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, ease
themselves and spit in the water, like householders who enjoy pleasures of the
senses?” Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest
monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this group of six monks … in the water?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, … in the water?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, … in the water? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should
be set forth:</p>
<p>‘I will not ease myself or spit in the water,’ is a training to be observed.”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Sk.75.1.2" href="#Bu-Sk.75.1.2"></a>
Now at that time ill monks were (too) scrupulous to ease themselves and spit in
the water. They told this matter to the lord. Then the lord, on this occasion,
in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow, monks, a monk if he is ill, to ease himself and spit in the water.
And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>‘I will not ease myself or spit in the water, if not ill,’ is a training to be
observed.”</p>
<p>If one is not ill he should not ease himself or spit in the water. Whoever out
of disrespect, if not ill, … offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>There is no offence if it is unintentional, if he is not <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.152" href="#BD.3.152"></a>
thinking, if he does not know, if he is ill, if done on dry land and he pours
water over it, if there are accidents, if he is mad, unhinged, in pain, if he
is the first wrongdoer.</p>

<p>Recited, venerable ones, are the rules of training. Concerning them, I ask the
venerable ones: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? And a second
time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? And a third time I
ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? The venerable ones are
quite pure in this matter, therefore they are silent; thus do I understand
this.</p>
