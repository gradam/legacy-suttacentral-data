<p>Monks’ Undetermined</p>
<h1>2: The second training rule</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.336"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-an.2.1"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1829"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At this time Venerable Udāyī knew that the Master had prohibited sitting alone with a woman on a private and concealed seat suitable for doing it, and so instead he sat alone in private with the same girl. When they were able, they just chatted; otherwise he gave her a teaching.</p>
<p>A second time Visākhā had been invited to that family. When she arrived, she saw Udāyī sitting alone in private with the same girl, and she said to Udāyī, “Venerable, it’s not appropriate that you should sit alone with a woman on a private seat. Although you may not be aiming at that act, people with little confidence are hard to convince.” But Udāyī did not listen. After leaving, Visākhā informed the monks of what had happened. The monks of few desires … complained and criticized him, “How can Venerable Udāyī sit alone with a woman on a private seat?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1830"></a> After rebuking Udāyī in many ways, they informed the Master … “Is it true, Udāyī, that you sat alone with a woman on a private seat?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked him: “… Foolish man, how can you sit alone with a woman on a private seat? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.192"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1831"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘Although a seat is not concealed, nor suitable for doing it, it may be suitable for speaking lewdly to a woman.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.337"></a> If a monk sits alone with a woman in private on such a seat, and a trustworthy female lay follower sees him and accuses him of an offense entailing suspension or an offense entailing confession, then, if he admits to the sitting, he is be dealt with according to one of these two or according to what that trustworthy female lay follower has said. This rule too is undetermined.’”</strong> </p>
