<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-an.1.1"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1803"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time Venerable Udāyī was associating with and visiting a number of families in Sāvatthī. One of those families had given their daughter in marriage to the son of another family. Just then, after dressing one morning, Venerable Udāyī took his bowl and robe and went to the first of those families. When he arrived, he asked where the daughter was, and he was told that she had been given to another family. That family too supported Venerable Udāyī. He then went there and again asked where the girl was. They said, “She’s sitting in her room.” He approached that girl, and the two of them sat down alone on a private and concealed seat suitable for doing it. When they were able, they just chatted; otherwise he gave her a teaching.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.188"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1804"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.331"></a> At that time Visākhā Migāramātā had many healthy children and grandchildren, and she was considered very auspicious. At sacrifices, festivals, and celebrations people would feed Visākhā first. Just then she had been invited to the family that supported Venerable Udāyī. When she arrived, she saw him sitting alone with that girl, and she said to him, “Venerable, it’s not appropriate that you should sit alone with a woman on a private and concealed seat suitable for doing it. Although you may not be aiming at that act, people with little confidence are hard to convince.” But Udāyī did not listen. After leaving, Visākhā informed the monks about what had happened. The monks of few desires … complained and criticized him, “How can Venerable Udāyī sit alone with a woman on a private and concealed seat suitable for doing it?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1805"></a> After rebuking Udāyī in many ways, they informed the Master … “Is it true, Udāyī, that you sat alone with a woman on a private and concealed seat suitable for doing it?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked him: “… Foolish man, how can you sit alone with a woman on a such a seat? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1806"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.332"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk sits alone with a woman on a private and concealed seat suitable for doing it, and a trustworthy female lay follower sees him and accuses him of an offense entailing expulsion or an offense entailing suspension or an offense entailing confession, then, if he admits to the sitting, he is to be dealt with according to one of these three or according to what that trustworthy female lay follower has said. This rule is undetermined.’”</strong> </p>
