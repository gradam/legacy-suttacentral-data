<h1>Monks’ Training (<i lang="pi">Sekhiya</i>) 57</h1>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Sk.57.1.1" href="#Bu-Sk.57.1.1"></a>
… in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks taught
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) with a sunshade in his hand. Those who were modest monks … spread
it about, saying: “How can this group of six monks teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) with a sunshade in his hand?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, taught <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) with a sunshade in his hand?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.141" href="#BD.3.141"></a>
“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How can you, foolish men,
teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) with a sunshade in his hand? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should
be set forth:</p>
<p>‘I will not teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) with a sunshade in his hand,’ is a training to be observed.”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Sk.57.1.2" href="#Bu-Sk.57.1.2"></a>
At that time monks were (too) scrupulous to teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) who was ill (and) had a sunshade in his hand.
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.200" href="#Vin.4.200"></a>
People … spread it about, saying: “How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans,
not teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) who is ill (and) has a sunshade in his hand?”</p>
<p>Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks told this
matter to the lord. Then the lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having
given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) who is ill (and) has a sunshade in his hand. And thus, monks,
this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>‘I will not teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) who is not ill (and) who has a sunshade in his hand,’ is a
training to be observed.”</p>
<p><span class="term">Sunshade</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there are three (kinds of) sunshade: white sunshade, sunshade of matting,
sunshade of leaves; fastened at the middle, fastened to the rim.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Dhamma</span> means:
<span class="gloss">spoken by the enlightened one, spoken by disciples, spoken by seers, spoken by
devatas, connected with the goal, connected with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.142" href="#BD.3.142"></a>
<span class="term">Should teach</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he teaches by line, for every line there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he
teaches by syllable, for every syllable there is an offence of wrong--doing.</span></p>
<p>Dhamma should not be taught to (someone) who has a sunshade in his hand (and)
who is not ill. Whoever out of disrespect teaches <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) who has a sunshade in his hand (and) who is not ill, there is an
offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>There is no offence if it is unintentional, if he is not thinking, if he does
not know, if he is ill, if there are accidents, if he is mad, if he is the
first wrong-doer</p>
