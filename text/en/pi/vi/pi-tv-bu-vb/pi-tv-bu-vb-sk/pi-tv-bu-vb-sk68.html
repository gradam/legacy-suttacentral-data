… in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks, having
sat down on the ground, taught <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) sitting on a seat … “…</p>
<p>‘Having sat down on the ground, I will not teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) sitting on a seat (and) who is not ill,’ is a training to be
observed.”</p>
<p>Having sat down on the ground, <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> should not be taught to (someone) sitting on a seat (and) who is not ill.
Whoever out of disrespect, having sat down on the ground, teaches <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) sitting on a seat (and) who is not ill, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</p>
