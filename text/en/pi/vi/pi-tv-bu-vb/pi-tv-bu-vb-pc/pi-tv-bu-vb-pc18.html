<h1>Monks’ Confession 18: the training rule on upper stories</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.46"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.18.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.254"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa443"></a> <span class="var" hidden>viharati → eko heṭṭhā (?)</span> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time two monks were staying in a dwelling with an upper story belonging to the Order, one staying below and one above. The monk above sat down suddenly on a bed with detachable legs.<span class="var" hidden>nippatitvā → nipatitvā (bj) | patitvā (s1-3) | nippaṭitvā (pts1)</span> A leg fell off and hit the monk below on the head. He cried out. Monks came rushing to and asked him why, and he told them what had happened.</p>
<p> The monks of few desires … complained and criticized him,</p>
<p><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa444"></a> “How can a monk sit down suddenly on a bed with detachable legs on an upper story in a dwelling belonging to the Order?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a> After criticizing that monk in many ways, they told the Master.… “Is it true, monk, that you did this?”</p>
<p> “It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p> The Buddha rebuked him, “… Foolish man, how can you sit down suddenly on a bed with detachable legs on a upper story in a dwelling belonging to the Order?<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.255"></a> This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa445"></a><strong class="rule"><span class="note" hidden>I am here taking <i lang="pi">kuṭi</i> to refer to the upper story itself, rather than the whole building, which already has the separate name <i lang="pi">vihāra</i>.</span> ‘If a monk sits down or lies down on a bed or a bench with detachable legs on an upper story in a dwelling belonging to the Order, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”</strong> </p>
