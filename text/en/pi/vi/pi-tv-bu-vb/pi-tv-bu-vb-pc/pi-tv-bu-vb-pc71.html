… at Kosambī in Ghosita’s monastery. Now at that time the venerable Channa
indulged in bad habits. Monks spoke thus: “Reverend Channa, do not do that, it
is not allowable.” He spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Your reverences, I will not train myself in this rule of training until I have
inquired about it of another monk, experienced, expert in discipline.”</p>
<p>Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can the venerable
Channa, being spoken to by monks regarding a rule, speak thus: ‘Your
reverences, I will not train myself … expert in discipline’?”</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Channa, being spoken to by monks regarding a
rule, spoke thus: ‘Your reverences, I will not train myself … expert in
discipline’?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, being spoken to by monks regarding a rule, speak
thus: ‘Your reverences, I will not train myself … expert in discipline’? It is
not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus,
monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.37" href="#BD.3.37"></a>
“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, being spoken to by monks regarding a rule, should speak thus:
‘Your reverences, I will not train myself in this rule of training until I have
inquired about it of another monk, experienced, expert in discipline,’ there is
an offence of expiation. Monks, it should be learnt, it should be inquired
into, it should be investigated by a monk who is training. This is the proper
course here.</span>”</p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:

<p><span class="term">By monks</span> means:
<span class="gloss">by other monks.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Regarding a rule</span> means:

a rule.</span></p>

until I have inquired … expert in discipline’</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he says, “I am inquiring about it of a wise, experienced, clever, learned
speaker on the rules,” there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

If he thinks that he is ordained when he is ordained (and) speaks thus, there
is an offence of expiation. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.38" href="#BD.3.38"></a>
If he is in doubt as to whether he is ordained … If he thinks that he is not
ordained when he is ordained <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.142" href="#Vin.4.142"></a>
(and) speaks thus, there is an offence of expiation. If, being spoken to about
what is not laid down, he speaks thus, “This does not conduce to expunging
(evil), nor to punctiliousness, nor to graciousness, nor to decreasing (the
obstructions), nor to putting forth energy,” (and) says: “Your reverences, I
will not train myself in this rule of training until I have inquired about it
of another monk, experienced, expert in discipline, one who is a wise,
experienced, clever, learned speaker on the rules,” there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If being spoken to by one who is not ordained about what is laid
down or about what is not laid down, he speaks thus: “This does not conduce to
expunging (evil) … nor to putting forth energy,” (and) says, “Your reverences,
I will not train myself in this rule of training until I have inquired about it
of another monk, experienced, expert in discipline, one who is a wise,
experienced, clever, learned speaker on the rules,” there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he thinks that he is ordained when he is not ordained, there is
an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether he is not ordained,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that he is not ordained when
he is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
