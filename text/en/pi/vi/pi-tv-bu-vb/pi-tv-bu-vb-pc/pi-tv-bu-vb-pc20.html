<h1>Monks’ Confession 20: the training rule on containing living beings</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.49"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.20.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.261"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa473"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Āḷavī at the Aggāḷava Shrine. At that time the monks at Āḷavī were doing building work. And they poured water that they knew contained living beings onto grass and clay, and they got others to do the same. The monks of few desires … complained and criticized them, “How can the monks at Āḷavī pour water that they know contains living beings onto grass and clay, and get others to do the same?”</p>
<p>After criticizing those monks in many ways, they told the Master.… “Is it true, monks, that you do this?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked them, “… Foolish men, how can you pour water that you know contains living beings onto grass and clay, and get others to do the same? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa474"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk pours, or gets poured, water that he knows contains living beings onto grass or clay, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”</strong> </p>

<p>If it does not contain living beings, but he perceives it as containing living beings, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
