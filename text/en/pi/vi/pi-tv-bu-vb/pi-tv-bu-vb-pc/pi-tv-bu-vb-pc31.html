… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time,
not far from Sāvatthī, alms-food came to be prepared in a public rest-house by
some guild. The group of six monks, dressing in the morning, taking their bowls
and robes, entering Sāvatthī for alms-food, (but) not obtaining alms-food, went
to the public rest-house. People, saying: “At last the revered ones are come,”
duly waited upon them. Then the group of six monks also on the second day …
also on the third day, dressing in the morning … going to the public
rest-house, ate (a meal). Then it occurred to the group of six monks:</p>
<p>“What difference do we make? Having gone to the monastery, then tomorrow it
will be right to return just here.” Staying on and on just there, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.70" href="#Vin.4.70"></a>
they ate alms-food at the public rest-house. Followers of other sects went
away. People … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the recluses, sons of the Sakyans, staying on and on, eat alms-food at
the public rest-house? The alms-food at the public rest-house is not prepared
merely for them, the alms-food at the public rest-house is prepared simply for
everybody.”</p>
<p>Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the group of six monks, staying on and on, eat alms-food at a public
rest-house?” …</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.304" href="#BD.2.304"></a>
“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks … rest-house?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men … rest-house? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should
be set forth:</p>
<p>“One meal at a public rest-house may be eaten. If he should eat more than that,
there is an offence of expiation.”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>

Now at that time the venerable Sāriputta, going to Sāvatthī through the Kosalan
country, approached a certain public rest-house. People saying: “At last the
elder is come,” duly waited upon (him). Then when the venerable Sāriputta had
eaten, a painful affliction arose, he was not able to leave that public
rest-house. Then on the second day these people spoke thus to the venerable
Sāriputta: “Eat, honoured sir.” Then the venerable Sāriputta, thinking: “It is
not allowed by the lord, staying on and on, to eat alms-food at a public
rest-house,” and being scrupulous, he did not accept; he became famished. Then
the venerable Sāriputta, having gone to Sāvatthī, told this matter to the
monks. The monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord in this
connection, on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks,
saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, when a monk is ill, staying on and on, to eat alms-food at
a public rest-house. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set
forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">One meal in a public rest-house may be eaten by a monk who is not ill. If he
should eat more than that, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.31.3.1" href="#Bu-Pc.31.3.1"></a>
<span class="term">Not ill</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he is able to leave that public rest-house. Ill means: he is not able to leave
that public rest-house. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.71" href="#Vin.4.71"></a>
</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.305" href="#BD.2.305"></a>
<span class="term">Meal in a public rest-house</span> means:
<span class="gloss">any one meal of the five (kinds of) meals; as much as is wanted is prepared,
not specially for him, in a hall or in a hut or at the foot of a tree or in the
open air.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">By a monk who is not ill</span> means:
<span class="gloss">(a meal) may be eaten once (only). If he accepts more than that, thinking: “I
will eat,” there is an offence of wrong-doing; for each mouthful, there is an
offence of expiation.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.31.3.2" href="#Bu-Pc.31.3.2"></a>
If he thinks that he is not ill when he is not ill, (and) eats more than a meal
at a public rest-house, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as
to whether he is not ill … If he thinks that he is ill when he is not ill …
offence of expiation. If he thinks that he is not ill when he is ill, there is
an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether he is ill, there is
an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that he is ill when he is ill, there is
no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.31.3.3" href="#Bu-Pc.31.3.3"></a>
There is no offence if he is ill; if he eats once when he is not ill; if he
eats going out or coming in; if the proprietors, having invited him, offer him
food, if it is specially prepared (for him); if what is prepared is not as much
as is wanted; setting aside the five (kinds of) meals there is no offence in
(eating) any others; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
