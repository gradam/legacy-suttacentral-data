<h1>Monks’ Confession 23: the training rule on nuns’ dwelling places</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2><h3>First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.56"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.23.1"></a> <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.276"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="531"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. At that time the monks from the group of six went to the nuns’ dwelling place and instructed the nuns from the group of six.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards the nuns said to the nuns from the group of six, “Come, Venerables, let’s go to the instruction.”</p>
<p><span class="var" hidden>Yampi → yaṃ hi (pts1, mr)</span> “There’s no need; the monks from the group of six came and instructed us right here.”</p>
<p>The nuns complained and criticized the monks from the group of six, “How can the monks from the group of six go and instruct the nuns at their dwelling place?” And those nuns told the monks.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="532"></a> The monks of few desires … complained and criticized those monks, “How can the monks from the group of six go and instruct the nuns at their dwelling place?”… “Is it true, monks, that you did this?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked them, “… Foolish men, how can you go and instruct the nuns at their dwelling place? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3>Preliminary ruling</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="533"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk goes to a nun’s dwelling place, and then instructs her, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”</strong></p>
<p class="endsection"><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="534"></a> In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3>Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.23.2"></a> <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.277"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="535"></a> Soon afterwards Mahāpajāpati Gotamī became sick. The senior monks went to see her and said,<span class="var" hidden>kacci → kacci te (bj, s1-3)</span> “We hope you’re bearing up, Gotamī, we hope you’re getting better?”</p>
<p>“I’m not bearing up, Venerables, and I’m not getting better. Please give me a teaching.”</p>
<p>“It’s not allowable for us to go and teach a nun at her dwelling place.” And being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not teach her.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, the Master robed up in the morning, took his bowl and robe, and went to Mahāpajāpati Gotamī, where he sat down on a prepared seat. And he said to her, “I hope you’re bearing up, Gotamī, I hope you’re getting better?”</p>
<p>“Previously, Venerable Sir, the senior monks would come and teach me, and because of that I would be comfortable. But now they don’t teach because they’re afraid of wrongdoing, saying, ‘It’s been prohibited by the Master.’ And because of that I’m not comfortable.”</p>
<p>After instructing, inspiring, and gladdening her with a teaching, the Master rose from his seat and departed. Soon afterwards the Master gave a teaching and addressed the monks,<strong class="rule"> “Monks, I allow you to go and instruct a sick nun at her dwelling place.</strong> And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.57"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="536"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk goes to the nuns’ dwelling place and then instructs them, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offense entailing confession. The appropriate reason is that a nun is sick.’”</strong> </p>
