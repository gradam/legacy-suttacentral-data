<h1>Monks’ Confession 16: the training rule on encroaching</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.16.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.247"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa415"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.<span class="var" hidden>vuṭṭhāpenti → ettha te iti kammapadaṃ ūnaṃ viya</span> At that time the monks from the group of six had taken possession of the best sleeping places, but the senior monks made them move. They thought, “What can we do so that we may dwell here during the rainy season?” They then arranged their sleeping places in a way that encroached on the senior monks, thinking, “Those who feel crowded will leave.”</p>
<p> The monks of few desires … complained and criticized them, “How can the monks from the group of six arrange their sleeping places in a way that encroaches upon the senior monks?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.43"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa416"></a> After criticizing those monks in many ways, they told the Master.… “Is it true, monks, that you do this?”</p>
<p> “It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p> The Buddha rebuked them, “… Foolish men, how can you arrange your sleeping places in a way that encroaches on the senior monks?<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.248"></a> This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa417"></a> <span class="var" hidden>pubbupagataṃ → pubbūpagataṃ (bj, s1-3) </span><span class="var" hidden>anupakhajja → anūpakhajja (s1-3)</span><strong class="rule"> ‘If, in a dwelling belonging to the Order, a monk arranges his sleeping place in a way that encroaches on a monk that he knows arrived there before him, with the intention that anyone who feels crowded will leave, and he does so only for this reason and no other, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”</strong> </p>
