… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks took possession of the best sleeping-places. The monks
who were elders turned them away. Then it occurred to the group of six monks:</p>
<p>“What now if we, by some stratagem, should spend the rainy season in this very
place?” Then the group of six monks, encroaching upon (the space intended for)
monks who were elders, lay down in the sleeping-places, saying:</p>
<p>“He for whom it becomes too crowded may depart.” Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the group of six monks lie down in sleeping-places, encroaching upon
(the space intended for) monks who are elders?” Then these monks told this
matter to the lord. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.43" href="#Vin.4.43"></a>
…</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, lay down in sleeping-places … for
monks who are elders?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, lie down in sleeping-places, encroaching upon (the
space intended for) monks, who are elders? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.248" href="#BD.2.248"></a>
those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should
be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should lie down in a sleeping-place in a dwelling belonging to
the Order, knowing that he is encroaching upon (the space intended for) a monk
arrived first, saying, ‘He for whom it becomes too crowded may depart,’ doing
it for just this object, not for another, there is an offence of expiation.” </span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:

<p><span class="term">A dwelling belonging to the Order</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it comes to be given to the Order, handed over to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">He knows</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he knows, thinking, ‘He is an old man’; he knows, thinking, ‘He is an ill man’;
he knows, thinking, ‘It was given to the Order.’</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Encroaching upon</span> means:
<span class="gloss">forcing a way into.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should lie down in a sleeping-place</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if entering or departing he spreads a sleeping-place or has one spread in the
precincts of a couch or a chair, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he sits
down on it or lies down on it, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Doing it for just this object, not for another</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there comes to be no other object whatever for which to lie down, encroaching,
in a sleeping-place.</span></p>

If he thinks that it belongs to the Order when it belongs to the Order, (and)
encroaching, lies down, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as
to whether it belongs to the Order, (and) encroaching, lies down, there is an
offence of expiation. If he thinks that it belongs to an individual when it
belongs to the Order, (and) encroaching, lies down, there is an offence of
expiation. If entering or departing, setting aside the precincts of a couch or
chair, he spreads a sleeping—<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.249" href="#BD.2.249"></a>
place or causes one to be spread, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he
sits down on it or lies down on it, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he
spreads a sleeping-place or causes one to be spread in the precincts of a
dwelling-place or in an assembly-room or in a hut or at the foot of a tree or
in the open air, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he sits down on it or
lies down on it, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it
belongs to the Order when it belongs to an individual, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it belongs to an individual, there
is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it belongs to an individual
when it belongs to an individual (but) to another individual, there is an
offence of wrong-doing; if it belongs to the individual himself, there is no
offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.16.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.16.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if an ill man enters, if one pressed by cold or by heat
enters, if there are accidents; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
