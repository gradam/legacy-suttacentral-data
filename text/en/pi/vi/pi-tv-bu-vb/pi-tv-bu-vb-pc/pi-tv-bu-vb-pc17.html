<h1>Monks’ Confession 17: the training rule on throwing out</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.44"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.17.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.250"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa428"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time the monks from the group of seventeen were repairing a large dwelling nearby, intending to stay there for the rainy season. The monks from the group of six saw this and said, “These monks from the group of seventeen are repairing a dwelling. Let’s throw them out.” But some of them said, “Let’s wait until they’ve finished repairing it.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa429"></a> Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six said to those from the group of seventeen, “Leave, we get this dwelling.”</p>
<p><span class="var" hidden>paṭikacceva → paṭigacceva (bj, pts1)</span> “Shouldn’t you have told us beforehand? We would’ve repaired another one.”</p>
<p> “Doesn’t this dwelling belong to the Order?”</p>
<p> “Yes it does.”</p>
<p> “Well then, leave; we get this dwelling.”</p>
<p> “The dwelling is large. You can stay here and so can we.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.251"></a> But they said, “Leave, we get this dwelling,” and they grabbed them by the neck and threw them out in anger.</p>
<p> The monks from the group of seventeen cried. When other monks asked them why, they told them what had happened.</p>
<p> The monks of few desires … complained and criticized them, “How can the monks from the group of six angrily throw other monks out of a dwelling belonging to the Order?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa430"></a> After criticizing those monks in many ways, they told the Master.… “Is it true, monks, that you did this?”</p>
<p> “It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p> The Buddha rebuked them, “… Foolish men, how can you angrily throw other monks out of a dwelling belonging to the Order? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa431"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk, in anger, throws another monk out of a dwelling belonging to the Order, or gets him thrown out, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”</strong> </p>

<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa439"></a> If he throws out one of his requisites, or he gets it thrown out, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If he throws him out or gets him thrown out from the vicinity of a dwelling, from an assembly-hall, from under a roof-cover, from the foot of a tree, or from a space out in the open, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If he throws out one of his requisites from any of these places, or he gets it thrown out, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If he throws out one who is not fully ordained, or gets them thrown out, from a dwelling, from the vicinity of a dwelling, from an assembly-hall, from under a roof-cover, from the foot of a tree, or from a space out in the open, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
