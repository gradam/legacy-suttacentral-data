<h1>Monks’ Confession 30: the training rule on sitting in private</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.30.1"></a> <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.300"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="648"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time the former wife of Venerable Udāyī had been given the full ordination as a nun. She often went to see Udāyī, and he often went to see her. And on one occasion Udāyī was seated in private alone with that nun.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="649"></a> The monks of few desires … complained and criticized him, “How can Venerable Udāyī sit in private alone with a nun?” … “Is it true, Udāyī, that you did this?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked him, “… Foolish man, how can you sit in private alone with a nun? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="650"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk sits in private alone with a nun, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”</strong> </p>

<h2>Permutations</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.30.2.2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="658"></a> If it is private, and he perceives it as private, and he sits down alone with a nun, he commits an offense entailing confession. If it is private, but he is unsure if it is, and he sits down alone with a nun, he commits an offense entailing confession. If it is private, but he perceives it as not private, and he sits down alone with a nun, he commits an offense entailing confession.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="659"></a> If it is not private, but he perceives it as private, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is not private, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is not private, and he perceives it as not private, there is no offense.</p>
<h2>Non-offenses</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.30.2.3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="660"></a> There is no offense: if he has another person who understands as a companion; if he stands and does not sit down; if he is not seeking privacy; if he sits down thinking of something else; if he is insane; if he is the first offender.</p>
