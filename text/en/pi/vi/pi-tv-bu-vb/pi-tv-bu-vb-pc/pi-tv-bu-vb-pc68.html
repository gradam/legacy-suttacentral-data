<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.21" href="#BD.3.21"></a>
… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a pernicious view had arisen to a monk named Ariṭṭha who had formerly been a
vulture-trainer, like this: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.134" href="#Vin.4.134"></a></p>
<p>“In so far as I understand <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> taught by the lord, it is that in following those things called
stumbling-blocks by the lord, there is no stumbling-block at all.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.22" href="#BD.3.22"></a>
Several monks heard: “A pernicious view has arisen to the monk named Ariṭṭha,
who was formerly a vulture-trainer, like this: ‘In so far as I understand …
there is no stumbling-block at all.’”</p>
<p>Then these monks approached the monk Ariṭṭha, who had formerly been a
vulture-trainer, and having approached they spoke thus to the monk Ariṭṭha, who
had formerly been a vulture-trainer:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, reverend Ariṭṭha, that a pernicious view has arisen to
you, like this: ‘In so far as I understand … no stumbling-block at all’?”</p>
<p>“Undoubtedly, your reverences, as I understand <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> taught by the lord, it is that in following those things called
stumbling-blocks by the lord, there is no stumbling-block at all.”</p>
<p>“Do not speak thus, reverend Ariṭṭha; do not misrepresent the lord,
misrepresentation of the lord is not at all seemly, and the lord certainly
would not speak thus. Reverend Ariṭṭha, in many a figure are things that are
stumbling-blocks called stumbling-blocks by the lord, and in following these,
there is a veritable stumbling-block. Sense-pleasures are declared by the lord
to be (things) affording little satisfaction, of much pain, of much
tribulation, wherein is more danger. Sense-pleasures are declared by the lord
(to be) like a skeleton, of much pain, of much tribulation, wherein is <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.23" href="#BD.3.23"></a>
more danger. Sense-pleasures are declared by the lord (to be) like a lump of
meat, of much pain, of much tribulation, wherein is more danger. Sense-pleasure
are declared by the lord (to be) like a fire-brand of dry-grass, …
Sense-pleasures are declared by the lord (to be) like a pit of glowing embers,
… Sense-pleasures are declared by the lord (to be) like a dream, …
Sense-pleasures are declared by the lord (to be) like something borrowed, …
Sense-pleasures are declared by the lord (to be) like the fruits of a tree, …
Sense-pleasures are declared by the lord (to be) like a slaughterhouse, …
Sense-pleasures are declared by the lord (to be) like an impaling-stake, …
Sense-pleasures are declared by the lord (to be) like a snake’s head, of much
pain, of much tribulation, wherein is more danger.”</p>
<p>Yet the monk Arittha, who had formerly been a vulture-trainer, being spoken to
thus by these monks, expressed that pernicious view as before, obstinately
holding to it, adhering to it:</p>
<p>“Undoubtedly, your reverences, as I understand <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> taught by the lord, it is that in following those things called
stumbling-blocks by the lord, there is no stumbling-block at all.”</p>
<p>And since those monks were unable to dissuade the monk Ariṭṭha, who had
formerly been a vulture-trainer, from that pernicious view, then those monks
approached the lord, and having approached they told this matter to the lord.
Then the lord, on this <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.135" href="#Vin.4.135"></a>
occasion, in
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.24" href="#BD.3.24"></a>
this connection, having had the Order of monks convened, questioned the monk
Arittha, who had formerly been a vulture-trainer, saying :</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that to you, Ariṭṭha, a pernicious view arose like
this: ‘In so far as I understand <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> … no stumbling-block at all’?”</p>
<p>“Undoubtedly, lord, as I understand <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> … no stumbling-block at all.”</p>
<p>“To whom then do you, foolish man, understand that <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> was taught thus by me? Are not, foolish man, things that are stumbling-blocks
called stumbling-blocks by me in many a figure, and in following these is there
not a veritable stumbling-block? Sense-pleasures are declared by me (to be
things) affording little pleasure, of much pain, of much tribulation, wherein
is more danger … Sense-pleasures are declared by me (to be) like a snake’s
head, of much pain, of much tribulation, wherein is more danger. And yet you,
foolish man, not only misrepresent me because of your own wrong grasp, but you
also injure yourself and give rise to much demerit which for a long time will
be for you, foolish man, of woe and sorrow. It is not, foolish man, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of
training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should speak thus: ‘In so far as I understand
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> taught by the lord, it is that in following those things called
stumbling-blocks by the lord, there is no stumbling-block at all’; that monk
should be spoken to by the monks thus: ‘Do not, venerable one, speak thus, do
not misrepresent the lord, misrepresentation of the lord is not at all seemly,
and the lord certainly would not speak thus; in many a figure, your reverence,
are things that are stumbling- <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.25" href="#BD.3.25"></a>
blocks called stumbling-blocks by the lord, and in following these there is a
veritable stumbling-block.’ And if that monk, when he has been spoken to thus
by the monks, should persist as before, that monk should be admonished by the
monks up to the third time for giving up that (course). If, being admonished up
to the third time, he should give it up, that is good. But if he should not
give it up, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.68.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.68.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.68.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… monk is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should speak thus</span> means:
<span class="gloss">‘In so far as I understand <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> taught by the lord … no stumbling-block at all.’</span></p>
<p><span class="term">That monk</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the monk who speaks thus.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">By the monks</span> means:
<span class="gloss">by other monks, who see, who hear; he should be told by these: “Do not,
venerable one, speak thus … a veritable stumbling-block.” And a second time he
should be told … And a third time he should be told … If he gives it up, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.136" href="#Vin.4.136"></a>
that is good. If he does not give it up, there is an offence of wrong-doing.
If, having heard, they do not speak, there is an offence of wrong-doing. That
monk, having been pulled to the midst of the Order, should be told: “Do not,
venerable one, speak thus … a veritable stumbling-block.” And a second time he
should be told … And a third time he should be told. … If he gives it up, that
is good; if he does not give it up, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">That monk should be admonished</span>.
<span class="gloss">And thus, monks, should he be admonished: the Order should be informed by an
experienced, competent monk, saying: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. A pernicious view has arisen to the
monk so and so, like this: “In so far as I <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.26" href="#BD.3.26"></a>
understand … no stumbling-block at all.” He does not give up that view. If it
seems right to the Order, let the Order admonish the monk so and so that he may
give up this view. This is the motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to
me: A pernicious view has arisen to the monk so and so … He does not give up
this view. The Order admonishes the monk so and so that he may give up this
view. If the admonishing of the monk so and so that he may give up this view is
pleasing to the venerable ones, let them be silent; if it is not pleasing, then
you should speak. And a second time I speak forth this matter … And a third
time I speak forth this matter. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me …
then you should speak. The monk so and so has been admonished by the Order for
giving up this view. If it is pleasing to the Order, let them be silent … thus
do I understand this.’</span></span></p>
<p>As a result of the motion there is an offence of wrong-doing; as a result of
two proclamations there are offences of wrong-doing; at the end of the
proclamations there is an offence of expiation.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.68.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.68.2.2"></a>
If he thinks that it is a legally valid act when it is a legally valid act
(and) does not give it up, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt
as to whether it is a legally valid act … If he thinks that it is not a legally
valid act when it is a legally valid act (and) does not give it up, there is an
offence of expiation. If he thinks that it is a legally valid act when it is
not a legally valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt
as to whether it is not a legally valid act, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not a legally valid act when it is not a
legally valid act, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.68.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.68.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if he is not admonished; if he gives it up; if he is mad,
if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
