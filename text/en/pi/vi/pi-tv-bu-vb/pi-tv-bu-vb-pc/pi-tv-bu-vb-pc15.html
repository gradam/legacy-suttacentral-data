<h1>Monks’ Confession 15: the second training rule on furniture</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.41"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.15.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.243"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa400"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time the monks from the group of seventeen were friends. The lived together, and when departing they departed together. On one occasion they put out bedding in a dwelling belonging to the Order, but then left without putting it away, getting it put away, or telling anyone. And the bedding was eaten by termites.</p>
<p> The monks of few desires … complained and criticized them, “How can those monks from the group of seventeen put out bedding in a dwelling belonging to the Order, and then leave without putting it away, getting it put away, or telling anyone? It gets eaten by termites.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa401"></a> After criticizing those monks in many ways, they told the Master.… “Is it true, monks, that those monks are acting in that way?”</p>
<p> “It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p> The Buddha criticized them, “… How can those foolish men put out bedding in a dwelling belonging to the Order, and then leave without putting it away, getting it put away, or telling anyone, and thereby the bedding gets eaten by termites? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
