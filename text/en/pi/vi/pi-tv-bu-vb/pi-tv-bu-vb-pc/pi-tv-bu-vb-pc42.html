… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, spoke thus to a monk, who
shared (his) brother’s cell:</p>
<p>“Come, your reverence, we will enter the village for alms-food.” Without having
had (alms-food) given to him, he dismissed him, saying: “Go away, your
reverence. Neither talking nor sitting down with you comes to be a comfort for
me; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.93" href="#Vin.4.93"></a>
either talking or sitting down alone comes to be a comfort for me.”</p>
<p>Then that monk, when the meal-time was near, was not able to walk for alms, and
returning he did not achieve participation in the meal; he became famished.
Then that monk, having gone to the monastery, told this matter to the monks.
Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can the venerable
Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, saying to a monk, ‘Come, your reverence, we
will go into the village for alms-food,’ without having had (alms-food) given
to him, dismiss him …?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Upananda, saying to a monk, ‘Come …’ dismiss
him? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And
thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, saying to a monk, ‘Come, your reverence, we will go into a
village or little town for alms-food,’ either causing to be given or not
causing to be given (alms-food) to him, should dismiss him, saying, ‘Go away,
your reverence, neither talking nor sitting down with you comes to be a comfort
for me; either <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.352" href="#BD.2.352"></a>
talking or sitting down alone comes to be a comfort for me’—if doing it for
just this object, not for another, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… is monk to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Monk</span> means:
<span class="gloss">another monk.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Come, your reverence, to a village or little town</span> means:
<span class="gloss">a village and a little town and a town, a village as well as little town.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Causing to be given (alms-food) to him</span> means:
<span class="gloss">causing conjey or solid food or soft food to be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Not causing to be given</span> means:
<span class="gloss">not causing anything to be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should dismiss</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if desiring to laugh, desiring to sport together with a woman, if desiring to
sit down in private, if desiring to indulge in bad habits, he speaks thus: ‘Go
away, your reverence, neither talking … sitting down alone comes to be a
comfort for me,’ (and) dismisses him, there is an offence of wrong-doing.
Dismissing him from sight or from hearing is an offence of wrong-doing. When he
is dismissed, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">If doing it for just this object, not for another</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there comes to be no other object whatever (for which) to dismiss him.</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.42.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.42.2.2"></a>
If he thinks that he is ordained when he is ordained, (and) dismisses him,
there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether he is
ordained … If he thinks that he is not ordained when he is ordained, (and)
dismisses him, there is an offence of expiation. If he finds fault with
another, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he dismisses one who is not
ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he finds fault <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.353" href="#BD.2.353"></a>
with another, there is an offence of wrong-doing.
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.94" href="#Vin.4.94"></a>
If he thinks that he is ordained when he is not ordained there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether he is not ordained, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that he is not ordained when he is not
ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.42.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.42.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if he dismisses him, saying: ‘Together we will not both
keep going’; if, seeing costly goods, he dismisses him, saying, ‘It will
produce a state of greed’; if, seeing a woman, he dismisses him, saying, ‘She
will produce dissatisfaction’; if he dismisses him, saying, ‘Take back conjey
or solid food or soft food for one who is ill, or for one who is left behind,
or for a guardian of the dwelling-place’; if, not desiring to indulge in bad
habits, he dismisses him if it ought to be done; if he is mad, if he is the
first wrong-doer.</p>
