<h1>Monks’ Confession 19: the training rule on large dwellings</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.47"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.19.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.257"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa457"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Monastery. At that time a minister who was Venerable Channa’s supporter was making him a dwelling. When the dwelling was finished, Channa had it roofed and plastered again and again. Being overloaded, the dwelling collapsed. Then, while collecting grass and sticks, Channa spoiled the barley field belonging to a certain brahmin. That brahmin grumbled and complained, “How can the Venerables spoil my barley field?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa458"></a> The monks heard the complaints of that brahmin, and the monks of few desires … complained and criticized Channa, “How can Venerable Channa get a finished dwelling roofed and plastered again and again, so that it collapsed from overloading?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa459"></a> After criticizing him in many ways, they told the Master.… “Is it true, Channa, that you did this?”</p>
<p> “It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p> The Buddha rebuked him, “… Foolish man, how can you get a finished dwelling roofed and plastered again and again, so that it collapses from overloading? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
