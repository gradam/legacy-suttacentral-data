… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time,
monks preparing lodgings in winter-time in the open air, drying their bodies in
the sun, when the time was announced, setting forth neither removed them nor
had them removed, (but) set forth without having asked (for permission). The
lodgings became damp. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can monks, preparing lodgings in the open air, setting forth, neither
remove them nor have them removed, (but) set forth without having asked (for
permission, so that) the lodgings are (left) damp?”</p>
<p>Then these monks told this matter to the lord …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that monks preparing lodgings in the open air …
(left) damp? … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, spreading or having spread in the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.239" href="#BD.2.239"></a>
open air a couch or a chair or a mattress or a stool belonging to the Order,
setting forth, should neither remove it nor have it removed, or should go away
without asking (for permission), there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>

Now at that time monks, staying in the open air, were bringing back lodgings
early in the morning. Now the lord saw these monks bringing back lodgings early
in the morning, and seeing them, in this connection, on this occasion, having
given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, for the eight months (of the time) not appointed for
keeping the rains <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.40" href="#Vin.4.40"></a>
to put aside lodgings in a hut or at the foot of a tree, wherever crows or
vultures do not leave droppings.</span>”</p>

If he thinks that it belongs to the Order when it belongs to the Order,
spreading it or having it spread in the open, setting forth should neither
remove it nor have it removed, or should go away without asking (for
permission), there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether
it belongs to the Order … there is an offence of expiation. If he thinks that
it belongs to an individual when it belongs to the Order, spreading it or … in
the open air … without having asked (for permission), there is an offence of
expiation. If it is a carpet or a bed-cover or a ground- <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.242" href="#BD.2.242"></a>
covering or a straw-mat or an animal’s skin or a mat for the feet or a wooden

wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it belongs to an individual, there
is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it belongs to an individual
when it belongs to an individual (but) to another individual, there is an

<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.14.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.14.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if, having removed it, he goes away; if, having caused it
to be removed, he goes away; if, having asked (for permission), he goes away;
if, drying himself in the sun, he goes away; if it comes to be taken possession
of by something; if there are accidents; if he is mad, if he is the first
wrong-doer.</p>
