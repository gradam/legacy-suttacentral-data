<h1>Monks’ Confession 14: the training rule on furniture</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2><h3>First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.14.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.14.1.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.238"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa380"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time it was winter, and the monks put furniture out in the open in order to warm themselves in the sun. But when the time for departure was announced, they left without putting it away, getting it put away, or telling anyone. And the furniture was rained on.</p>
<p> The monks of few desires … complained and criticized them, “How can those monks put furniture out in the open and then leave without putting it away, getting it put away, or telling anyone? The furniture was rained on.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa381"></a> After criticizing those monks in many ways, they told the Master.… “Is it true, monks, that you did this?… And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa382"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.239"></a><strong class="rule">‘If a monk takes a bed, a bench, a mattress, or a stool belonging to the Order and puts it out in the open or gets it put out, and he then leaves without putting it away, getting it put away, or telling anyone, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”</strong> </p>
<p class="endsection"><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa383"></a> In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3>Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.40"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.14.1.2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa384"></a> Soon afterwards monks who had stayed out in the open brought the furniture back even though it was not the rainy season. The Master saw this, and after giving a teaching, he addressed the monks,<strong class="rule"> “Monks, during the eight months outside of the rainy season, I allow you to store furniture under a roof-cover or at the foot of a tree or wherever crows or ravens donʼt leave droppings.”</strong></p>
