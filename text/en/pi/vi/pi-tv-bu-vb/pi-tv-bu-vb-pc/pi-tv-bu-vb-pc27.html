<h1>Monks’ Confession 27: the training rule on appointments</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2><h3>First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.27.1"></a> <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.288"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="589"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time the monks from the group of six traveled on a main road by appointment with nuns. People complained and criticized them, “Just as we go around with our wives, so these Sakyan ascetics go around by appointment with nuns.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="590"></a> The monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires … complained and criticized those monks, “How can the monks from the group of six travel on a main road by appointment with nuns?” … “Is it true, monks, that you do this?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked them, “… Foolish men, how can you travel on a main road by appointment with nuns? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3>Preliminary ruling</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="591"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk travels on a main road by appointment with a nun, even if just between villages, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”</strong></p>
<p class="endsection"><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="592"></a> In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3>Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.63"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.27.2"></a> <a class="wt-pa" id="593"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.289"></a> Soon afterwards a number of monks and nuns were traveling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī. The nuns said to the monks, “We’ll go with you.”</p>
<p>“Sisters, it’s not allowable for us to travel on a main road by appointment with nuns. You should go first, or we will.”</p>
<p>“Venerables, you have the highest status. Please go first.”</p>
<p>But because the nuns went behind, they were robbed and raped by bandits. When they arrived at Sāvatthī, they told the nuns there what had happened. The nuns then told the monks,<a class="wt-pa" id="594"></a> who in turn told the Master.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a> Soon afterwards the Master gave a teaching and addressed the monks,<strong class="rule"> “Monks, I allow you to travel on a main road by appointment with a nun if it’s a dangerous and frightening road that should be traveled with a group.</strong> ”And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="595"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk travels on a main road by appointment with a nun, even if just between villages, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offense entailing confession.<span class="note" hidden><i lang="pi">Sattho</i>, often translated as caravan. According to <span class="ref">Sp-ṭ.2.489</span> this refers either to a caravan of travelers walking on foot or to a caravan of carts: <i lang="pi">satthoti jaṅghasattho sakaṭasattho vā</i>.</span> The appropriate reason is that the road is considered dangerous and frightening and should be traveled with a group.’”</strong> </p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.27.3"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.27.3.1"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="596"></a><strong class="term"> A:</strong><span class="gloss"> whoever …</span><strong class="term"> Monk:</strong><span class="gloss"> … The monk who has been given the full ordination by a complete Order through a procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is unchallengeable and fit to stand— this sort of monk is meant in this case.</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="597"></a><strong class="term"> A nun:</strong><span class="gloss"> she has been given the full ordination by both Orders.</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="598"></a><strong class="term"> With:</strong><span class="gloss"> together.</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.290"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="599"></a><strong class="term"> By appointment: if he makes an appointment like this:</strong><span class="gloss"> he says, “Let’s go, Sister,” and she replies, “Yes, let’s go, Venerable;” or she says, “Let’s go, Venerable,” and he replies, “Yes, let’s go, Sister;” or he says, “Let’s go today/tomorrow/the day after tomorrow,” then he commits an offense of wrong conduct.</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="600"></a><strong class="term"> Even if just between villages:</strong><span class="gloss"> when the villages are a chicken’s flight apart, then for every village interval he commits an offense entailing confession.<span class="note" hidden>Half a <i lang="pi">yojana</i>. The length of a <i lang="pi">yojana</i> is uncertain, and perhaps it never was a precise distance. But a reasonable estimate is 8 miles or just under 13 kilometers (see ACMC, p.16). Thus half a <i lang="pi">yojana</i> is just over 6 km.</span> If it is in an uninhabited area, in the wilderness, then for every six kilometers he commits an offense entailing confession.</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="601"></a><strong class="term"> Unless there is an appropriate reason:</strong><span class="gloss"> except at an appropriate time.</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="602"></a><strong class="term"> The road […] should be traveled with a group:</strong><span class="gloss"> it is not possible to travel without a group.</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="603"></a> <span class="var" hidden>tasmiṃ magge → yasmiṃ magge (?)</span><strong class="term"> Dangerous:</strong><span class="gloss"> thieves have been seen along that road, camped, eating, standing, seated, or lying down.</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.64"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="604"></a><strong class="term"> Frightening:</strong><span class="gloss"> thieves have been seen along that road, injuring, robbing, or beating people. If they go thinking it is frightening, but then see that it is not, the nuns are to be dismissed, “Go, Sisters.”</span></p>
<h2>Permutations</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.27.3.2"></a> <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.291"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="605"></a> If there is an appointment, and he perceives that there is, and he travels on a main road with a nun, even if just between villages, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offense entailing confession. If there is an appointment, but he is unsure if there is, and he travels on a main road with a nun, even if just between villages, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offense entailing confession. If there is an appointment, but he perceives that there is not, and he travels on a main road with a nun, even if just between villages, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offense entailing confession.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="606"></a> If the monk makes an appointment, but the nun does not express her agreement, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If there is no appointment, but he perceives that there is, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If there is no appointment, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If there is no appointment, and he perceives that there is not, there is no offense.</p>
<h2>Non-offenses</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.27.3.3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="607"></a> There is no offense: if there is an appropriate reason; if he goes without an appointment; if the nun has made an appointment, but he has not expressed his agreement; if they go, but not according to the appointment; if there are dangers; if he is insane; if he is the first offender.</p>
