<h1>Monks’ Expulsion 4: Claiming Spiritual Attainments</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<h3>First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.4"></a> <a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.4.1"></a> <a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.4.1.1"></a> <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.151"></a> <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.87"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.534"></a> At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying near Vesālī in the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof. At that time a number of monks who were friends had entered the rains on the banks of the river Vaggumudā. Just then Vajjī was short of food and stricken by hunger, with crops blighted and turned to straw, and it was not easy to keep oneself going by collecting alms.</p>
<p>The monks considered the difficult circumstances, and they thought, “How can we remain united and in harmony, have a comfortable rains, and get almsfood without problems?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.535"></a> Some said, “We could do work for the householders, and they will give something in return. In this way we will be united and in harmony, and we will spend the rains in comfort and have no problems getting almsfood.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.536"></a> Some said, “There is no need to do work for the householders. Let us instead take messages for them, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.152"></a> and they will give something in return. In this way we will be united and in harmony, and we will spend the rains in comfort and have no problems getting almsfood.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.537"></a> Some said, “There is no need to do work for the householders, nor to take messages for them. Let us instead praise one another’s super-human achievements to the householders: ‘Such a monk has the first <i lang="pi">jhāna</i>, such a monk the second <i lang="pi">jhāna</i>, such a monk the third, such a monk the fourth; such a monk is stream-enterer, such a monk a once-returner, such a non-returner, such an <i lang="pi">arahant</i>; such a monk has the three true knowledges, and such the six direct knowledges.’ And then they will give to us. In this way we will be united <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.88"></a> and in harmony, and we will spend the rains in comfort and have no problems getting almsfood. Indeed, this is the better way, that we praise one another’s super-human achievements to the householders.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.538"></a> Then those monks praised one another’s super-human achievements to the householders: “Such a monk has the first <i lang="pi">jhāna</i> … such a monk has the six direct knowledges.” And those people thought: “We are fortunate that such monks have come to us for the rains. Such monks as these, who are virtuous <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.153"></a> and of good character, have never before entered the rains with us.” And they gave such food and drink to those monks that they did not even eat and drink themselves, or give to their parents, to their wives and children, to their slaves, servants and workers, to their friends and companions, or to their relatives. In this way those monks were handsome, with rounded features, bright faces, and clear complexion.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.4.1.2"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.539"></a> Now it was the custom for monks who had finished keeping the rains to go and see the Master. So when the rains was finished and the three months had elapsed, those monks put their lodging in order, took their bowls and robes, and departed for Vesālī. Walking by stages, they arrived at Vesālī and went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. There they approached the Master, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.540"></a> At that time the monks who had spent the rains in that region were thin, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.154"></a> haggard and pale, their veins protruding all over their limbs. But the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā were handsome, with rounded features, bright faces, and clear complexion. It is the custom for Buddhas, for Masters, to greet visiting monks, and so the Master said to them: “I hope you are keeping well, monks, I hope you are comfortable; I hope you spent the rains at ease, in concord and harmony, without dispute, and that you had no trouble getting almsfood?”</p>
<p>“We are keeping well, Master, we are comfortable; we spent the rains at ease, in concord and harmony, without dispute, and we had no trouble getting almsfood.”</p>
<p>Tathāgatas sometimes ask knowing, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.89"></a> and knowing sometimes do not ask … <span class="add">As in <a href="/en/pi-tv-bu-vb-pj1#Bu-Pj.1.2.1">Bu-Pj.1.2.1</a></span> … Buddhas, Masters, question the monks for two reasons, thinking, “We shall teach the Dhamma or lay down a training rule for the disciples.”</p>
<p>And the Master said to those monks: <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.541"></a> “In what way, monks, did you spent the rains at ease, without having any trouble getting almsfood?”</p>
<p>Then those monks informed the Master.</p>
<p>“But had you really achieved those super-human achievements?”</p>
<p>“No, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked them: “It is unsuitable, foolish men, it’s not becoming, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.155"></a> it’s not proper, it’s not fitting for an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could you for the sake of your stomachs praise one another’s super-human achievements to householders? It would be better for your bellies to be cut open with a sharp butcher’s knife than for you to praise one another’s super-human achievements to householders. Why is that? Because for that reason you might die or experience death-like suffering, but you would not because of that be reborn in a bad destination. But for <em>this</em> reason you might. This will not give rise to confidence in those without it …” … Having thus rebuked them and spoken on the Dhamma, he addressed the monks:</p>
<div class="sutta-parallel">
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.4.1.3"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.542"></a> “Monks, there are these five great gangsters to be found in the world. What five? A certain great gangster thinks like this: ‘Oh when will I, with a following of a hundred or a thousand men, wander among villages, towns, and royal capitals, killing and making others kill, destroying and making others destroy, tormenting and making others torment,’ and after some time he does just that. Just so, monks, a certain bad monk thinks like this: ‘Oh when will I, with a following of a hundred or a thousand people, go on tour among villages, towns, and royal capitals, being honoured, respected, revered, and worshipped, by both householders and those <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.156"></a> gone forth, and obtain robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines,’ and after some time he does <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.90"></a> just that. This is the first great gangster to be found in the world.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.543"></a> “Again, a certain bad monk learns the Dhamma and training proclaimed by the Tathāgata and takes it as his own. This is the second great gangster to be found in the world.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.544"></a> “Again, a certain bad monk groundlessly accuses someone who lives the spiritual life in purity of not being celibate. This is the third great gangster to be found in the world.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.545"></a> “Again, a certain bad monk takes valuable goods and requisites belonging to the Sangha—a monastery, the land of a monastery, a dwelling, the land for a dwelling, a bed, a bench, a cushion, a pillow, a brass vessel, a brass jar, a brass pot, a brass receptacle, an adze, a hatchet, an axe, a spade, a chisel, a creeper, bamboo, <i lang="pi">muñja</i>-grass, <i lang="pi">babbaja</i>-grass, <i lang="pi">tiṇa</i>-grass, clay, wooden articles, earthenware articles—and uses these to win over and create a following among householders. This is the fourth great gangster to be found in the world.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.157"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.546"></a> “But in this world with its gods, its lords of death, and its supreme beings, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans, this the greatest gangster: he who untruthfully and groundlessly boasts about a super-human achievement. Why is that? Monks, you have eaten the country’s almsfood by theft.”</p>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.547"></a> Whoever should declare himself to be other than he truly is,<br>
Has eaten this by theft, like a cheater who has deceived.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.548"></a> Many yellow-necks of bad qualities, uncontrolled and<br>
Wicked, by their wicked deeds, in hell they are reborn.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.549"></a> Better to eat an iron ball heated like a blazing fire,<br>
Than for the immoral and uncontrolled to eat the country’s alms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.550"></a> Then the Master, having rebuked the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā in various ways for being difficult to maintain, difficult to support … “… And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3>Preliminary ruling</h3>
<p class="subrule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.551"></a> “If a monk falsely claims for himself a super-human achievement, knowledge <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.158"></a> and vision worthy of the noble ones, saying, ‘This I know, this I see,’ but after some time—whether questioned or not, but having committed the offence and desiring purification—should say, ‘Not knowing I said that I know, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.91"></a> not seeing that I see; what I said was empty and false,’ he too is expelled and not in communion.”</p>
<p class="end"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.552"></a> In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3>Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.4.2"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.553"></a> At one time a number of monks, thinking they had seen what they had not, attained what they had not, achieved what they had not, realised what they had not, declared final knowledge based on overestimation. After some time their minds inclined to sense desire, anger, and confusion. They became anxious, thinking, “The Master has laid down a training rule; yet we … declared final knowledge based on overestimation. Could it be that we have fallen into an offence entailing expulsion? They informed Venerable Ānanda, who informed the Master. He said: “Ānanda, these monks declared final knowledge <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.159"></a> based on overestimation, thinking they had seen what they had not … but this is negligible. <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.554"></a> And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.555"></a> “If a monk falsely claims for himself a super-human achievement, knowledge and insight worthy of the noble ones, saying, ‘This I know, this I see,’ but after some time—whether questioned or not, but having committed the offence and desiring purification—should say, ‘Not knowing I said that I know, not seeing that I see; what I said was empty and false,’ except if it is through overestimation, he too is expelled and not in communion.”</p>

<p>They became anxious and said: “But we’re not <i lang="pi">arahants</i>, and yet this brahmin addresses us as if we were. What should we do?” They informed the Master.</p>
<p>“There is no offence in regard to what is spoken in faith.”</p>

<hr>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.736"></a> At <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.104"></a> one time a certain monk claimed a super-human achievement to another monk: “I have these qualities.” He became anxious …</p>

<hr>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.739"></a> At one time the relations of a certain monk said to him: “Come, bhante, enjoy the pleasures of the senses.”</p>
<p>“The pleasures of the senses have been rejected by me.” He became anxious …</p>

<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.740"></a> At one time the relations of a certain monk said to him: “Come, bhante, enjoy yourself.”</p>
<p>“I am enjoying myself with the highest enjoyment.”</p>
<p>He became anxious, thinking: “Those who are true disciple of the Master may speak thus, but I’m not such a disciple. Could it be that I have committed an offence entailing expulsion?” He informed the Master.</p>
<p>“What was your intention, monk?”</p>
<p>“I did not intend to make a claim, Master.”</p>
<p>“There is no offence for one who does not intend to make a claim.”</p>

<p>A certain monk thought, “Let them know me as an <i lang="pi">arahant</i>,” and he set out first from that monastery. He became anxious. He informed the Master …</p>
<p>“You have fallen into an offence entailing expulsion.”</p>

<div class="sutta-parallel">
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.4.9"></a> <a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.4.9.1"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.742"></a> At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the Squirrel Sanctuary. At that time Venerable Lakkhaṇa and Venerable Mahāmoggallāna <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.181"></a> were staying on Mount Vulture Peak. Then, in the morning, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna dressed, took his bowl and robe, approached Venerable Lakkhaṇa, and said: “Lakkhaṇa, let us enter Rājagaha for alms.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Venerable Lakkhaṇa replied.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.743"></a> <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.105"></a> As they were descending from Mount Vulture Peak, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna smiled at a certain place. Venerable Lakkhaṇa asked him, “Why are you smiling?”</p>
<p>“This is not the right time to answer this question. Ask me in the presence of the Master.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.4.9.2"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.744"></a> Then, after their meal and after returning from almsround, Venerable Lakkhaṇa and Venerable Mahāmoggallāna approached the Master and sat down to one side. And Venerable Lakkhaṇa said to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna:</p>
<p>“Just now, as Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was descending from Mount Vulture Peak, he smiled at a certain place. Why did you smile?”</p>
<p>“As I was coming down from <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.182"></a> Mount Vulture Peak, I saw a skeleton flying through the air, and vultures, crows, and hawks were in close pursuit, striking it between the ribs, while it uttered cries of distress. And I thought how amazing and astounding it is that such a being should exist, such a spirit, such a state of existence.”</p>
<p>The monks complained and criticised him: “Venerable Mahāmoggallāna is claiming a super-human achievement.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.745"></a> Then the Master addressed the monks:</p>
<p>“Monks, there are disciples who possess vision and knowledge, and they can see, know, and witness such a thing. Previously I too have seen that being, but I didn’t speak about it. If I had, others would not have believed me and that would have been for their harm and suffering for long time. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.183"></a> That being, monks, was a cattle butcher in this very Rājagaha. As a result of his deeds he was tormented in hell for many years, for many hundreds of years, for many thousands of years, for many hundreds of thousands of years. And now, because of the remaining result of his actions, he is experiencing such a state of existence. Moggallāna spoke truly. There is no offence for Moggallāna.”</p>

<hr>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.754"></a> “As I was coming down from Mount Vulture Peak, I saw a man who had testicles like pots flying through the air.

<p>“Monks, that being was a wicked brahmin in this very Rājagaha. At the time of Kassapa, the fully Awakened One, he invited the Sangha to a meal. He filled a trough with dung, announced the time, and said: ‘Sirs, eat as much as you like and take the rest away with you.’ …</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.757"></a> “As I was coming down from Mount Vulture Peak, I saw a flayed woman flying through the air, and vultures, crows, and hawks were in close pursuit, tearing at her and pulling her to pieces, while she uttered cries of distress.” …</p>

<hr>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.762"></a> “As I was coming down from Mount Vulture Peak, I saw a nun … I saw a trainee nun … a novice monk … a novice nun flying through the air. Her outer robe was ablaze and burning, her bowl was ablaze and burning, her waistband was ablaze and burning, her body was ablaze and burning, and she was uttering cries of distress.

<p>The monks complained and criticised him: “Venerable Moggallāna is claiming a super-human achievement.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.763"></a> Then the Master addressed the monks:</p>
<p>“Monks, there are disciples who possess <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.188"></a> vision and knowledge, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.108"></a> and they can see, know, and witness such a thing. Previously, monks, I too have seen this novice nun, but I did not speak about it. If I had, others would not have believed me and that would have been for their harm and suffering for long time. During the time of Buddha Kassapa’s dispensation, that novice nun was a bad novice nun. As a result of her deeds, she was tormented in hell for many years, for many hundreds of years, for many thousands of years, for many hundreds of thousands of years. And now, because of the remaining result of her actions, she is experiencing such a state of existence. Moggallāna spoke truly. There is no offence for Moggallāna.”</p>

<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.4.9.4"></a> And Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the monks:</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.764"></a> “This stream, the Tapodā, flows from a lake with beautiful water—cool, sweat, and pure—with lovely and charming banks, with an abundance of fishes and turtles, and with blooming lotuses the size of wheels. <span class="pts" id="and.yet.the.tapodā.is.hot.”"></span></p>
<p>The monks complained and criticised him: “How can Venerable Mahāmoggallāna say, ‘This stream the Tapodā flows from a lake of beautiful water … And yet this Tapodā is hot.’ Venerable Mahāmoggallāna is claiming a super-human achievement.” And they informed the Master.</p>
<p>“Monks, the Tapodā flows from a lake of beautiful water … with blooming lotuses the size of wheels. But the Tapodā runs between the two great hells, that is why it is <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.189"></a> hot. Moggallāna spoke truly. There is no offence for Moggallāna.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.4.9.5"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.765"></a> At one time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was defeated in battle by the Licchavis. Then the king collected his armies and beat the Licchavis. Delight about the battle spread about: “The Licchavis were defeated by the king!”</p>
<p>Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the monks: “The king was defeated by the Licchavis.”</p>
<p>The monks complained and criticised him: “How can Venerable Moggallāna say, ‘The king was defeated by the Licchavis,’ when delight about the battle is spreading about thus: ‘The Licchavis were defeated by the king!’ Venerable Mahāmoggallāna is claiming a super-human achievement.” They informed the Master.</p>
<p>“Monks, first the king was defeated by the Licchavis <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.109"></a> and then, after he had collected his army, the king beat the Licchavis. Moggallāna spoke truly. There is no offence for Moggallāna.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.4.9.6"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.766"></a> And Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the monks: “After attaining an imperturbable <i lang="pi">samādhi</i> on the banks of the river Sappinikā, I heard the noise of elephants plunging in, emerging, and trumpeting.”</p>
<p>The monks complained and criticised him: “How can Venerable Mahāmoggallāna say <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.190"></a> such a thing. He is claiming a super-human achievement.” They informed the Master.</p>
<p>“Monks, there is such a <i lang="pi">samādhi</i>, but it’s not wholly purified. Moggallāna spoke truly. There is no offence for Moggallāna.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.4.9.7"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.767"></a> And Venerable Sobhita addressed the monks: “I can recall five hundred eons.”</p>
<p>The monks complained and criticised him: “How can Venerable Sobhita say, ‘I can recall five hundred eons’? He is claiming a super-human achievement.” They informed the Master.</p>
<p>“Monks, Sobhita has this ability, and that was just one birth. Sobhita spoke truly. There is no offence for Sobhita.”</p>
<p class="end"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.768"></a> The fourth offence entailing expulsion is finished.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.769"></a> “Venerables, the four rules entailing expulsion have been recited. If a monk commits any one of them, he is no longer in communion with the monks. As before, so after, he is expelled and not <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.191"></a> in communion. In regard to this I ask the Venerables: ‘Are you pure in this?’ A second time I ask: ‘Are you pure in this?’ A third time I ask: ‘Are you pure in this?’ You are pure in this and therefore silent. I will remember it thus.”</p>
<p class="end"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.770"></a>The expulsion rules are finished.</p>
