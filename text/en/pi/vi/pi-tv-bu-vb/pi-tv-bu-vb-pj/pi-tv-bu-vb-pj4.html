<h1>Monks’ Expulsion 4: the fourth training rule</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<h3>First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.4"></a>
<a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.4.1"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.4.1.1"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.151"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.87"></a>
<a class="ms-pa" id="ms.534"></a>
At one time, the Buddha was staying near Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. At that time a number of monks who were friends had entered the rains residence on the banks of the river Vaggumudā. Just then Vajjī was short of food and afflicted with hunger, with crops blighted and turned to straw, and it was not easy to get by on almsfood.</p>
<p>The monks considered the difficult circumstances, and they thought, “How can we remain united and in harmony, have a comfortable rains, and get almsfood without problems?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.535"></a>
Some said, “We could work for the householders, and
they’ll give something in return. In this way we’ll be united and in harmony, and
we’ll spend the rains in comfort and have no problems getting almsfood.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.536"></a>
Some said, “There’s no need to work for the householders.
Let’s instead take messages for them, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.152"></a>
and they’ll give something in return. In this way we’ll be united and in
harmony, and we’ll spend the rains in comfort and have no problems getting
almsfood.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.537"></a>
Some said, “There’s no need to work for the householders,
nor to take messages for them. Let’s instead praise one another’s
super-human qualities to the householders: ‘Such a monk has the first absorption, such a monk the second absorption, such a monk the third, such a monk the fourth; such a monk is a stream-enterer,
such a monk a once-returner, such a non-returner, such a perfected one; such a monk has the three true insights, and such the six higher knowledges.’ Then they’ll give to us. In this way we’ll be united <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.88"></a>
and in harmony, and we’ll spend the rains in comfort and have no problems getting
almsfood. Indeed, this is the better way, that we praise one another’s
super-human qualities to the householders.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.538"></a>
Then those monks praised one another’s super-human qualities to the
householders: “Such a monk has the first absorption … such a monk has the six higher knowledges.” And those people thought, “We’re fortunate that such monks have come to us for the rains residence. Such monks as these, who are virtuous <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.153"></a>
and of good character, have never before entered the rains residence with us.” And they
gave such food and drink to those monks that they did not even eat and drink
themselves, or give to their parents, to their wives and children, to their
slaves, servants, and workers, to their friends and companions, or to their
relatives. In this way those monks were handsome, with rounded features, bright
faces, and clear skin.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.4.1.2"></a>
<a class="ms-pa" id="ms.539"></a>
Now it was the custom for monks who had finished keeping the rains residence to go to
see the Master. So when the rainy-season residence was completed and the three months had
elapsed, those monks put their lodgings in order, took their bowls and robes, and
departed for Vesālī. When they eventually arrived at Vesālī, they went to the
hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. There they approached the Master,
bowed down to him, and sat down to one side.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.540"></a>
At that time the monks who had completed the rainy-season residence in that region were thin,
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.154"></a>
haggard, and pale, their veins protruding all over their limbs. But the monks
from the banks of the Vaggumudā were handsome, with rounded features, bright
faces, and clear skin. It is the custom for Buddhas to greet visiting monks, and so the Master said to them, “I hope youʼre keeping well, monks, I hope youʼre comfortable; I hope you
spent the rains at ease, in concord and harmony, without dispute, and that you
had no trouble getting almsfood?”</p>
<p>“Weʼre keeping well, Master, weʼre comfortable; we spent the rains at ease,
in concord and harmony, without dispute, and we had no trouble getting
almsfood.”</p>
<p>Buddhas sometimes ask knowing, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.89"></a>
and knowing sometimes do not ask; they ask knowing the right time to ask, and they ask knowing the right time not to ask. Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, not when it is unbeneficial; in regard to what is unbeneficial, the Buddhas have destroyed the bridge. Buddhas question the monks for two reasons: to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule.”</p>
<p>And the Master said to those monks, <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.541"></a> “In what way, monks, did you spend the rains at ease, without having any trouble getting almsfood?”</p>
<p>Then those monks informed the Master.</p>
<p>“But had you really achieved those super-human qualities?”</p>
<p>“No, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked them: “It’s unsuitable, foolish men,
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.155"></a>
itʼs not proper, itʼs not fitting for an ascetic, itʼs not allowable, itʼs not
to be done. How can you for the sake of your stomachs praise one another’s
super-human qualities to householders? It would be better for your bellies
to be cut open with a sharp butcher’s knife than for you to praise one
another’s super-human qualities to householders. Why is that? Because for that reason you might die or experience death-like suffering, but you wouldn’t because of that be reborn in a bad destination. But for <em>this</em> reason you might. This will not give rise to confidence in those without it …” … After criticizing them and giving a teaching, he addressed the monks:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.4.1.3"></a>
<a class="ms-pa" id="ms.542"></a>
“Monks, there are these five great gangsters to be found in the world. What
five? A great gangster thinks like this: ‘Oh when will I, with a
following of a hundred or a thousand men, wander among villages, towns, and royal
capitals, killing and making others kill, destroying and making others
destroy, tormenting and making others torment?’ Then after some time, he does
just that. Just so, monks, a bad monk thinks like this: ‘Oh when will I, with a following of a hundred or a thousand people, go wandering among
villages, towns, and royal capitals; be honored, respected, and revered by both householders and those <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.156"></a>
gone forth; and obtain robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines?’ Then after some
time, he does <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.90"></a>
just that. This is the first great gangster to be found in the world.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.543"></a>
Again, a bad monk learns the Teaching and training proclaimed by the Buddha and takes it as his own. This is the
second great gangster to be found in the world.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.544"></a>
Again, a bad monk groundlessly accuses someone who lives the spiritual
life in purity of not abstaining from sexuality. This is the third great gangster to be found
in the world.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.545"></a>
Again, a bad monk takes valuable goods and requisites belonging to the monastic Order—a monastery, the land of a monastery, a dwelling, the land of a dwelling, a bed, a bench, a cushion, a pillow, a metal vessel, a metal jar, a metal pot, a metal receptacle, an adz, a hatchet, an ax, a spade, a chisel, a creeper, bamboo, <i lang="pi">muñja</i>-reed, <i lang="pi">pabbaja</i>-reed, grass, clay, wooden articles, earthenware articles—and uses them to win over and create a following among householders. This is the fourth great gangster to be found in the world.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.157"></a>
<a class="ms-pa" id="ms.546"></a>
But in this world with its gods, its lords of death, and its supreme beings,
in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans, this is
the greatest gangster: he who untruthfully and groundlessly boasts about a
super-human quality. Why is that? Monks, you’ve eaten the country’s
almsfood by theft.”</p>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.547"></a>
Whoever should declare himself to be other than he truly is,<br>
Has eaten this by theft, like a cheater who has deceived.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.548"></a>
Many ocher-necks of bad qualities, uncontrolled and wicked—<br>
By their wicked deeds, they are reborn in hell.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.549"></a>
It is better to eat an iron ball, heated, like a burning flame,<br>
Than for the immoral and uncontrolled to eat the country’s alms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.550"></a>
Then the Master, after criticizing the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā in
various ways for being difficult to maintain, difficult to support … “… And,
monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3>Preliminary ruling</h3>
<p class="subrule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.551"></a>
‘If a monk falsely claims for himself a super-human quality, knowledge
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.158"></a>
and vision worthy of the noble ones, saying, ”This I know, this I see,” but
after some time—whether questioned or not, but having committed the offense and
desiring purification—should say: ”Not knowing I said that I know, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.91"></a>
not seeing that I see; what I said was empty and false,” he too is expelled and
not in communion.’”</p>
<p class="end"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.552"></a>
In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3>Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.4.2"></a>
<a class="ms-pa" id="ms.553"></a>
At one time a number of monks, thinking they had seen what they had not,
attained what they had not, achieved what they had not, realized what they had
not, declared final knowledge because of overestimation. After some time, their
minds inclined to sense desire, anger, and confusion. They became remorseful,
thinking, “The Master has laid down a training rule; yet we declared final
knowledge because of overestimation. Could it be that we’ve committed an
offense entailing expulsion?” They informed Venerable Ānanda, who informed the
Master. He said, “Ānanda, these monks declared final knowledge <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.159"></a> because of overestimation, thinking they had seen what they had not, attained what they had not, achieved what they had not, realized what they had not, but this is negligible. <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.554"></a> And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.555"></a>
‘If a monk falsely claims for himself a super-human quality, knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, saying, “This I know, this I see,” but after
some time—whether he is questioned or not, but having committed the offense and
desiring purification—should say: “Not knowing I said that I know, not
seeing that I see; what I said was empty and false,” unless it is due to overestimation, he too is expelled and not in communion.ʼ”</p>

<h3>Case details, part 2</h3>
<div class="sutta">
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.4.9"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.4.9.1"></a>
<a class="ms-pa" id="ms.742"></a>
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary, while Venerable Lakkhaṇa and
Venerable Mahāmoggallāna <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.181"></a>
were staying on Mount Vulture Peak. Then, one morning, Mahāmoggallāna dressed, took his bowl and robe, approached Lakkhaṇa,
and said, “Lakkhaṇa, let’s enter Rājagaha for almsfood.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.743"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.105"></a>
As they were descending from Mount Vulture Peak, Mahāmoggallāna smiled
at a certain place. Lakkhaṇa asked him, “Why are you
smiling?”</p>
<p>“This isn’t the right time to reply. Please ask me in the presence
of the Master.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.4.9.2"></a>
<a class="ms-pa" id="ms.744"></a>
Then, after their meal and after returning from almsround, Lakkhaṇa
and Mahāmoggallāna approached the Master and sat down to one side.
And Lakkhaṇa said to Mahāmoggallāna:</p>
<p>“Just now, as you were descending from Mount Vulture
Peak, you smiled at a certain place. Why was that?”</p>
<p>“As I was coming down from <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.182"></a>
Mount Vulture Peak, I saw a skeleton flying through the air. Vultures,
crows, and hawks were in close pursuit of it, striking it between the ribs, while it
uttered cries of distress. And I thought how amazing and astonishing
it is that such a being should exist, such a spirit, such a state of
existence.”</p>
<p>The monks complained and criticized him: “Venerable Mahāmoggallāna is claiming a super-human ability.” <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.745"></a>The Master then said to them:</p>
<p>“There are disciples who have vision and knowledge, and they can
see, know, and witness such things. I too, monks, have seen that being, but
I didn’t speak about it. If I had, others wouldn’t have believed me, and that
would have been for their harm and suffering for long time. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.183"></a>
That being was a cattle-butcher in this very Rājagaha. As a result of
his deeds, he was tormented in hell for many years, for many hundreds of years,
for many thousands of years, for many hundreds of thousands of years. And now,
because of the remaining result of his actions, he’s experiencing such an existence. Moggallāna spoke truthfully. There’s no offense for Moggallāna.”</p>

out through his feet—and he uttered cries of distress. …” …</p>

long time. During the time of Buddha Kassapa’s dispensation, that novice nun
was a bad novice nun. As a result of her deeds, she was tormented in hell for
many years, for many hundreds of years, for many thousands of years, for many
hundreds of thousands of years. And now, because of the remaining result of her

“This stream, the Tapodā, flows from a lake with beautiful waters—cool,
sweat, and pure—with smooth and pleasant banks, with an abundance of fish and
turtles, and with blooming lotuses the size of wheels.”</p>
<p>The monks complained and criticized him, “How can Venerable Mahāmoggallāna
say such a thing? On the the contrary, the Tapodā is hot. Venerable Mahāmoggallāna is claiming a super-human
ability.” And they informed the Master.</p>
<p>“Monks, the Tapodā flows from a lake of beautiful waters—cool, sweat, and pure—with smooth and pleasant banks, with an abundance of fish and turtles, and with blooming lotuses the size of wheels. But the Tapodā runs between the two great hells; that’s
why it’s <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.189"></a>
hot. Moggallāna spoke truthfully. There’s no offense for Moggallāna.”</p>

<p>Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to the monks: “The King was defeated by the Licchavīs.”</p>
<p>The monks complained and criticized him: “How can Venerable Moggallāna say that the King was defeated by the Licchavīs when people are delighted and the word is spreading that the Licchavīs have been defeated by the King? Venerable Mahāmoggallāna is claiming a super-human ability.” They informed the Master.</p>
<p>“Monks, first the King was defeated by the Licchavīs, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.109"></a>
but then, after he had rallied his army, the King beat the Licchavīs.
Moggallāna spoke truthfully. There’s no offense for Moggallāna.”</p>

Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to the monks: “After
attaining an imperturbable stillness on the banks of the river Sappinikā, I heard the noise of elephants plunging
in, emerging, and trumpeting.”</p>
<p>The monks complained and criticized him: “How can Venerable Mahāmoggallāna say <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.190"></a>
such a thing? He’s claiming a super-human ability.” They informed the
Master.</p>

The fourth offense entailing expulsion is finished.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.769"></a>
“Venerables, the four rules entailing expulsion have been recited. If a monk commits any one of them, he is no longer in communion with the monks. As before, so after, he’s expelled and not <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.191"></a> in communion. In regard to this I ask you, ‘Are you pure in this?’ A second time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?’ A third time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?’ You are pure in this and therefore silent. I will remember it thus.”</p>
