<p>Monks’ Relinquishment</p>
<h1>19. The training rule on trading with money</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-np.19.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.106"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2222"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time monks from the group of six traded with money in various ways. People grumbled and complained, “How can the Sakyan ascetics trade with money in various ways, just like householders who indulge in sensual pleasures?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2223"></a> Monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires … complained and criticized those monks, “How can those monks from the group of six act in this way?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2224"></a> After criticizing those monks in many ways, they informed the Master. … “Is it true, monks, that you do this?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked them: “… Foolish men, how can you trade with money in various ways? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2225"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk trades with money in various ways, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”</strong> </p>

<p>It should be relinquished in the midst of the Order.<span class="kamma"> “And, monks, it should be relinquished in this way. After approaching the Order, that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.108"></a> He should then squat on his heels, put the palms of his hands together, and say, ‘Venerables, I have traded with money in various ways. This is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Order.’”</span> After relinquishing it, he is to acknowledge the offense. The acknowledgment should be received by a competent and capable monk.</p>
<p>If a monastery attendant or a lay follower is available, you should tell him, “Look into this.” If he says, “What can I get you with this?”, you should not say, “Get this or that;” you should point out what is allowable: ghee, oil, honey, or sugar. If he makes a purchase and brings back what is allowable, everyone may enjoy it except the one who did the exchange into money.</p>
<p>If this is what happens, that is good. If not, you should tell him, “Discard this.” If he discards it, that is good. If he does not, a monk who has five qualities should be appointed as the money-discarder: one who is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and who knows the meaning of discarding and not discarding.</p>
<p>“And, monks, this is how he should be appointed. First the monk should be asked and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Order:</p>
<div class="kamma">
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2230"></a> ‘Venerables, let the Order listen to me. If it seems appropriate to the Order, it should appoint monk so-and-so as the money-discarder. This is the motion.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2231"></a> Venerables, let the Order listen to me. The Order appoints monk so-and-so as the money-discarder. Any monk who agrees to appointing monk so-and-so as the money-discarder should remain silent. Any monk who does not agree should say so.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2232"></a> The Order has appointed monk so-and-so as the money-discarder. The Order approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”</p>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2233"></a><strong class="rule"> The appointed monk should drop it without taking note of the location. If he takes note of where he drops it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.</strong></p>
<h2>Permutations</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2234"></a><span class="note" hidden>The commentarial explanation makes it clear that what is meant here is that one exchanges money into money. The same is true for the next two cases. See <span class="ref">Sp.3.696.30</span>: “For one who is exchanging a relinquishable object with a relinquishable object, in accordance with the cases spoken of in the previous training rule,” <i lang="pi">purimasikkhāpade vuttavatthūsu nissaggiyavatthunā nissaggiyavatthuṃ cetāpentassa</i>.</span> If it is money, and he perceives it as money, and he exchanges it into money, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If it is money, but he is unsure if it is, and he exchanges it into money, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If it is money, but he does not perceive it as money, and he exchanges it into money, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.</p>
<p><span class="note" hidden>The commentarial explanation makes it clear that what is meant here is that one exchanges what is not money into money, that is, one is selling something and therefore ending up with money. The same is true for the next two cases. See <span class="ref">Sp.3.697.7</span>: “One exchanges one’s own non-money for someone else’s money,” <i lang="pi">attano vā hi arūpiyena parassa rūpiyaṃ cetāpeyya</i>.</span> If it is not money, but he perceives it as money, and he exchanges it into money, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If it is not money, but he is unsure if it is, and he exchanges it into money, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If it is not money, and he does not perceive it as money, but he exchanges it into money, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2235"></a> If it is not money, but he perceives it as money, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is not money, but he is unsure if it is, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is not money, and he does not perceive it as money, there is no offense.</p>
<h2>Non-offenses</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2236"></a> There is no offense: if he is insane; if he is the first offender.</p>
