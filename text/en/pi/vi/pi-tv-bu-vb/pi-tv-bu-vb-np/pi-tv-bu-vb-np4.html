<h1>4. The training rule on used robes</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-np.4.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.30"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="1941"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time Venerable Udāyī’s former wife had become a nun. She frequently visited Udāyī, and he frequently visited her. And Udāyī shared his meals with that nun.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.206"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="1942"></a> After dressing one morning, Udāyī took his bowl and robe and went to her. He then uncovered his genitals in front of her and sat down on a seat. She too uncovered her genitals in front of him and sat down on a seat. Udāyī lustfully stared at her genitals, and he emitted semen. He then said to that nun:</p>
<p>“Sister, get some water; I’ll wash the robe.”</p>
<p>“Give it to me, Venerable, I’ll wash it.”</p>
<p>She then took some of the semen in her mouth and inserted some into her genitals. Because of that she became pregnant. The nuns said, “This nun is not abstaining from sexuality; she’s pregnant.”</p>
<p>She said, “Venerables, I do abstain from sexuality,” and she told them what had happened.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.31"></a> The nuns complained and criticized Udāyī, “How can Venerable Udāyī get a nun to wash a used robe?” They then informed the monks. The monks of few desires … complained and criticized him, “How can Venerable Udāyī get a nun to wash a used robe?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="1943"></a> After criticizing him in many ways, they informed the Master. … “Is it true, Udāyī, that you did this?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>“Is she a relative of yours?”</p>
<p>“No, Master.”</p>
<p>“Foolish man, a man and a woman who are not related don’t know what’s appropriate and what’s inappropriate in dealing with each other, what’s inspiring behavior and what’s not. And still you got an unrelated nun to wash a used robe. This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="1944"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk gets an unrelated nun to wash, dye, or beat a used robe, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”</strong> </p>

<hr>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a> If he tells her to wash it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. When it has been washed, it becomes subject to relinquishment.

When she has struck it once with her hand or with an implement, it becomes subject to relinquishment.</p>
<p>The robe should be relinquished to the Order, a group, or an individual.<span class="kamma"> “And, monks, it should be relinquished in this way. …<span class="add"> To be expanded as in <a href="/en/pi-tv-bu-vb-np1#13">Relinquishment 1, paragraphs 13–17</a>, with appropriate substitutions. …</span> ‘Venerables, this used robe which I got an unrelated nun to wash is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Order.’ … the Order should give … you should give … ‘I give this robe back to you.’”</span></p>
