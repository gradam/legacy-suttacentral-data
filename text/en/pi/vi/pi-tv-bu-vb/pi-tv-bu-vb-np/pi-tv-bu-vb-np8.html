<h1>Monks’ Relinquishment 8: setting aside (1st)</h1>
</div>
<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.8.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.53"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2015"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Sāvatthi in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time a certain man said to his wife: “I will give a robe to Venerable Upananda.”</p>
<p>A certain monk who was an alms-collector heard that man making this statement. He went to Venerable Upananda and said: “Upananda, you have much merit. I have just heard a man telling his wife that he will give you a robe.”</p>
<p>Venerable Upananda replied: “He is my supporter.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2016"></a>Venerable Upananda then went to that man and said: “Is it true that you desire to give me a robe?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, that is just what I was thinking.”</p>
<p>“If that is the case, then give me such-and-such a robe. For what is the point of giving a robe that I cannot use?”</p>
<p>Then that man grumbled and complained: “These Sakyan ascetics have great desires; they are not content. It’s not easy to give them a robe. How can Venerable Upananda approach me and make a suggestion about the robe without first being invited by me?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.54"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2017"></a>The monks heard the complaints of that man, and the monks of few desires … complained and criticised him: “How could Venerable Upananda approach a householder and make a suggestion about a robe without first being invited?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2018"></a>After criticising Venerable Upananda in many ways, they informed the Master … <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.216"></a> “Is it true, Upananda, that you approached a householder and made a suggestion about a robe without first being invited?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>“Is he a relative of yours?”</p>
<p>“No, Master.”</p>
<p>“Foolish man, people who are not related do not know what is appropriate and what is inappropriate in dealing with each other, what is right and what is wrong. And still you approached an unrelated householder and made a suggestion about a robe without first being invited. This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2 class="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2019"></a>“If a male or female householder has set aside a robe fund for an unrelated monk, thinking, ‘With this robe fund I will buy a robe and supply monk so-and-so with it;’ and if that monk, without first being invited, approaches him and makes a suggestion about the robe, saying, ‘It would be good, sir, if you <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.55"></a> would use this robe fund to buy such-and-such a robe and then supply me,’ and he does so because he wants something nice, he commits and offence entailing relinquishment and confession.”</p>

<hr>
<p>If that householder buys one that is long, wide, closely woven, or soft because of his statement, he commits an offence of bad conduct for the act of making the statement. If he gets the robe, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment. The robe is to be relinquished to a Sangha, a group, or an individual.</p>
<p>“And, monks, it is to be relinquished in this way. … <span class="add">To be expanded as in <a href="/en/pi-tv-bu-vb-np1#Bu-NP.1.3.2">Bu-NP.1.3.2</a>, with appropriate substitutions.</span> … ‘Bhante, this robe of mine, which I received after approaching an unrelated householder and making a suggestion about the robe without first being invited, is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ … the Sangha should give … the Venerables should give … ‘I give this robe back to the Venerable.’”</p>
<h2 class="cakka">Permutations</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.8.2.2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2037"></a>If the householder is unrelated and he perceives them as unrelated, and, without first being invited, he approaches them and makes a suggestion about the robe, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession. If the householder is unrelated, but he has doubts about it, and, without first being invited, he approaches them and makes a suggestion about the robe, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession. If the householder is unrelated, but he perceives them as related, and, without first being invited, he approaches them and makes a suggestion about the robe, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2038"></a>If the householder is related, but he perceive them a unrelated, he commit an offence of bad conduct. If the householder is related, but he has doubts about it, he <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.57"></a> commit an offence of bad conduct. If the householder is related and he perceive them as related, there is no offence.</p>
<h2 class="anapatti">Non-offences</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.8.2.3"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2039"></a>There is no offence: if it is from relatives; if it is from those who have given an invitation; if it is for the benefit of another; if it is by means of his own property; if the householder wishes to buy something expensive, but he gets them to buy something inexpensive; if he is insane; if he is the first offender.</p>
