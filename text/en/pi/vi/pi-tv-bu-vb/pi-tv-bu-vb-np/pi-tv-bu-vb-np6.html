<h1>Monks’ Relinquishment 6: asking non-relations</h1>
</div>
<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>
<h3 class="anunidana1">First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-NP.6.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.6.1.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.42"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1974"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time Venerable Upananda the Sakyan was skilled at giving Dhamma talks. On one occasion the son of a wealthy merchant approached Venerable Upananda, paid respects to him, and sat down to one side. Venerable Upananda then <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.43"></a> instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a Dhamma talk. Afterwards that merchant’s son said to Venerable Upananda:</p>
<p>“Bhante, please tell me what you need. I am able to <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.211"></a> give you robes, almsfood, lodging requisites, and medicines.”</p>
<p>“If you wish to give me something, then give me one of your robes.”</p>
<p>“Bhante, it is shameful for the son of a good family to walk around in only one robe. Please wait until I get back home. I will then send you this robe or a better one.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1975"></a>A second time and a third time Venerable Upananda said the same thing to that merchant’s son, and he got the same reply. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.44"></a> He then said: “What is the point of inviting if you don’t want to give?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1977"></a>Then, after being pressured by Venerable Upananda, that merchant’s son gave him one of his robes and left. <a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.6.1.2"></a> People asked him: “Why, sir, are you walking around in one robe?” And he told them what had happened. People grumbled and complained: “These Sakyan ascetics have great desires; they are not content. It’s not easy even to give them an appropriate invitation. How can they take his robe when given an appropriate invitation by the merchant’s son?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1978"></a>The monks heard those people complaining, and the monks of few desires … complained and criticised Venerable Upananda: “How could Venerable Upananda ask the merchant’s son for a robe?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1979"></a>After criticising Venerable Udāyī in many ways, they informed the Master. … “Is it true, Upananda, that you asked the merchant’s son for a robe?</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>“Is he a relative of yours?”</p>
<p>“No, Master.”</p>
<p>“Foolish man, people who are not related do not know what is appropriate and what is inappropriate in dealing with each other, what is right and what is wrong. And still you asked the merchant’s son for a robe. This will not give rise to confidence <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.45"></a> in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3 class="anupannatti1">Preliminary ruling</h3>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1980"></a>“If a monk asks an unrelated male or female householder for a robe, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession.”</p>
<p class="endsection"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1981"></a>In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3 class="anunidana2">Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.6.2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1982"></a>At that time, while travelling on the main road from Sāketa to Sāvatthī, a number of monks <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.212"></a> were robbed by bandits. Knowing that the Master had a laid down a training rule and being fearful of wrongdoing, they did not ask for robes. They walked naked to Sāvatthī and paid respect to the monks. The monks said:</p>
<p>“These Ājīvaka ascetics are good people, in that they pay respects to the monks.”</p>
<p>“We are not Ājīvakas; we are monks!”</p>
<p>The monks then said to Venerable Upāli: “Upāli, please examine them.”</p>
<p>The naked monks then informed Venerable Upāli about what had happened, and he told the monks: “They are monks. Give them robes.”</p>
<p>The monks of few desires complained and criticised them: “How can monks go naked? Shouldn’t they have covered up with grass and leaves?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1983"></a>After criticising those monks in many ways, they informed the Master. He <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.46"></a> spoke on the Dhamma and addressed the monks: “<span class="subrule">Monks, if your robes are stolen or destroyed, I allow you to ask an unrelated householder for a robe. At the first monastery where you arrive, if the Sangha has a monastery robe, a bed sheet, a ground cover, or a pillow <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.47"></a> case, you should take that and put it on, thinking, ‘When I get a robe, I will return it.’ If there are none of these things, you should cover up with grass and leaves before going on. One should not go on while naked. If one does, there is an offence of bad conduct.</span> And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2 class="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1984"></a>“If a monk asks an unrelated male or female householder for a robe, without an appropriate reason, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession. The appropriate reasons are that his robes are taken from him or lost.”</p>
