<p>Monks’ Relinquishment</p>
<h1>28. The training rule on haste-cloth</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time a minister who was going away sent a message to the monks: “Come, Venerables, I wish to give a rainy-season robe.”</p>
<p>The monks thought, “The Master has allowed rainy-season robes only for those who have completed the rains residence,” and being afraid of wrongdoing they did not go. That minister complained and criticized them, “How can you not come when I send a message? I’m going out with the army. It’s hard to know whether I will live or die.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2386"></a> Monks heard the complaints of that minister, and they informed the Master. Soon afterwards the Master gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow you to receive haste-cloth, and then store it.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.261"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-np.28.1.2"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.152"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2387"></a> Knowing that the Master had made this allowance, monks received haste-cloths and stored them beyond the robe season, in bundles on a bamboo robe-rack.</p>
<p>While inspecting the dwellings, Venerable Ānanda saw that cloth, and he asked the monks, “Whose cloth is this?”</p>
<p>“It’s our haste-cloth.”</p>
<p>“How long have you stored it?”</p>
<p>They informed him, and Ānanda then complained and criticized them, “How can these monks receive haste-cloth and then store it beyond the robe season?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2388"></a> After criticizing those monks in many ways, Ānanda informed the Master. …<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.153"></a> “Is it true, monks, that some monks are doing this?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha criticized them: “… Monks, how can those foolish men receive haste-cloth and then store it beyond the robe season? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2389"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘When there are ten days left to the Kattika full moon that ends the first rains residence and haste-cloth becomes available to a monk, he may receive it if he regards it as urgent. If he stores it beyond that, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”</strong> </p>

<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2393"></a><strong class="term"> He may receive it if he regards it as urgent. He may then store it until the end of the robe season:</strong><span class="gloss"> establishing the perception of it as a haste-robe, he may store it.</span></p>

<hr>
<p>The cloth should be relinquished to an Order, a group, or an individual.<span class="kamma"> “And, monks, it should be relinquished in this way. …<span class="add"> To be expanded as in <a href="/en/pi-tv-bu-vb-np1#13">Relinquishment 1, paragraphs 13–17</a>, with appropriate substitutions. …</span> ‘Venerables, this haste-cloth which I have kept beyond the robe season is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Order.’ … the Order should give … you should give … ‘I give this cloth back to you.’”</span></p>
<h2>Permutations</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2396"></a> If it is haste-cloth and he perceives it as haste-cloth, and he keeps it beyond the robe season, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If it is haste-cloth, but he is unsure if it is, and he keeps it beyond the robe season, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.155"></a> If it is haste-cloth, but he does not perceives it as haste-cloth, and he keeps it beyond the robe season, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.</p>
<p>If it has not been determined, but he perceives it as determined … If it has not been transferred, but he perceives it as transferred … If it has not been given away, but he perceives it as given away … If it has not been lost, but he perceives it as lost … If it has not been destroyed, but he perceives it as destroyed … If it has not been burnt, but he perceives it as burnt … If it has not been stolen, but he perceives it as stolen, and he keeps it beyond the robe season, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2397"></a><strong class="rule"> If he uses a cloth which should be relinquished without first relinquishing it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.</strong> If it is not haste-cloth, but he perceives it as haste-cloth, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is not haste-cloth, but he is unsure if it is, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is not haste-cloth and he does not perceive it as haste-cloth, there is no offense.</p>
<h2>Non-offenses</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2398"></a> There is no offense: if within the robe season the haste-cloth is determined, transferred, given away, lost, destroyed, burnt, stolen, or taken on trust; if he is insane; if he is the first offender.</p>
