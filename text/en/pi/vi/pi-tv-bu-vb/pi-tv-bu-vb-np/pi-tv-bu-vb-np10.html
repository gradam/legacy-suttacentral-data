<h1>Monks’ Relinquishment 10: kings</h1>
</div>
<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-NP.10.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.10.1.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.62"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2070"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time a minister who was a supporter of Venerable Upananda sent a robe fund for Venerable Upananda by messenger, saying, “Buy a robe with this fund and give it to Venerable Upananda.”</p>
<p>The messenger went to Venerable Upananda and said: “Bhante, I have brought a robe fund for you. Please accept it.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.220"></a>“We do not receive robe funds, but we do receive allowable robes at the right time.”</p>
<p>“Is there anyone who provides services for you?”</p>
<p>Just then a certain lay disciple had come to the monastery on some business. Venerable Upananda told the messenger: “This lay disciple provides services for the monks.”</p>
<p>The messenger instructed that lay disciple <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.63"></a> and then returned to Venerable Upananda and said: “I have instructed the lay disciple you pointed out for me. Please approach him at the right time and he will give you a robe.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2071"></a>Later on that minister sent a messenger to Venerable Upananda, saying, “May the Venerable use the robe; we wish you to use the robe.” But Venerable Upananda did not say anything to that lay disciple. The minister sent the same message a second time, but again Venerable Upananda did nothing. The minister then sent the message a third time.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.10.1.2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2072"></a>On that occasion the towns-people were having a community meeting, and an agreement had been made that whoever came late got fined fifty coins. Just then Venerable Upananda went to that lay disciple and said: <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.64"></a> “I need a robe.”</p>
<p>“Bhante, please wait one day, for today there is a community meeting, and an agreement has been made that whoever comes late gets fined fifty coins.”</p>
<p>“Give me the robe today,” and he grabbed him by the belt.</p>
<p>Being pressured by Venerable Upananda, the lay disciple bought him a robe, and as a consequence he was late for the meeting. People asked him: “Sir, why are you late? You have just lost fifty coins.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2073"></a>Then that lay disciple informed those people of what had happened. They grumbled and complained: “These Sakyan ascetics have great desires; they are not content. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.221"></a> Even to provide them with a service is not easy. How can Venerable Upananda not agree when he is asked by a lay disciple to wait for a day?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2074"></a>The monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires … complained and criticised him: “How could Venerable Upananda not agree when asked by a lay disciple to wait for a day?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2075"></a>After criticising Venerable Upananda in many ways, they informed the Master … “Is it true, Upananda, that you <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.65"></a> did not agree when asked by a lay disciple to wait for a day?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked him: “… Foolish man, how could you not agree when asked by a lay disciple to wait for a day? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2 class="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.10.1.3"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2076"></a>“If a king, a king’s employee, a brahmin, or a householder sends a robe fund for a monk by messenger, saying, ‘Buy a robe with this robe fund and give it to monk so-and-so,’ and the messenger goes to that monk and says, ‘Bhante, I have brought a robe fund for you; please accept it,’ then that monk should reply, ‘We do not receive robe funds, but we do receive allowable robes at the right time.’ If that messenger then says, ‘Is there anyone who provides services for you?’, the monk, if he needs a robe, should point out a monastery attendant or a lay disciple and say, ‘He provides services for the monks.’ If the messenger instructs that service provider and then returns to the monk and says, ‘Bhante, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.66"></a> I have instructed the service provider you pointed out; please approach him at the right time and he will give you a robe,’ then, if that monk needs a robe, he should approach that service provider and prompt him and remind him two or three times, saying, ‘I need a robe.’ If he then gets a robe, good. If he does not get it, he should stand in silence for it at most six times. If he then gets a robe, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.222"></a> good. If he makes any further effort and then gets the robe, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession. If he does not get a robe, he should go to the owner of that robe fund, or send a messenger: ‘Sirs, that monk has not received any benefit from the robe fund you sent for him. May you get back what is yours; may it not be lost.’ This is the proper procedure.”</p>
