… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at the time
the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, came to be skilled in
robe-making. He, making an outer cloak of cloth rags, making it well-dyed,
well-worked, clothed himself in it. Then a certain wandering student, having
clothed himself in a costly cloth, approached the venerable Upananda, the son
of the Sakyans, and having approached the venerable Upananda, the son of the
Sakyans, he said: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.241" href="#Vin.3.241"></a></p>
<p>“Your reverence, this outer cloak of yours is beautiful, give it to me for
(this) cloth.”</p>
<p>“Find out about it, your reverence,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes, your reverence, I know (about it).”</p>
<p>“Very well, then, your reverence,” he said and gave (it to him).</p>
<p>Then that wandering student, clothing himself in that outer cloak, went to the
wandering students’ monastery. The wandering students spoke thus to <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.110" href="#BD.2.110"></a>
this wandering student: “This outer cloak of yours is beautiful, your
reverence. Where did you get it?”</p>
<p>“It was in exchange for my cloth, your reverences.”</p>
<p>“But, your reverence, this outer cloak will do for you for some time (only).
That cloth was better for you.”</p>
<p>Then that wandering student, thinking: “What the wandering students said is
true. This outer cloak will do for me for some time (only). That cloth was
better for me,” approached the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, and
having approached he spoke thus to the venerable Upananda, the son of the
Sakyans: “Your reverence, here is your outer cloak, give the cloth to me.”</p>
<p>“But, your reverence, did I not say to you, ‘Find out about it’? I will not
give it,” he said.</p>
<p>Then that wandering student … spread it about, saying: “Even householders give
back to a householder if he regrets; but why will one who has gone forth not
give back to one who has gone forth?”</p>
<p>Monks heard that wandering student who … spread it about. Those who were modest
monks … spread it about, saying: “How can the venerable Upananda, the son of
the Sakyans, engage in bartering together with a wandering student?” Then these
monks told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Upananda, engaged in bartering together with
a wandering student?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, engage in bartering together with a wandering
student? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.111" href="#BD.2.111"></a>
And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should engage in various kinds of bartering, there is an offence
of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-NP.20.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.20.2.1" href="#Bu-NP.20.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… is monk to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Various</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the requisites of robes, alms-food, lodgings, medicine for the sick, and even a
lump of chunam and a toothpick and unwoven thread.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should engage in … bartering</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he transgresses, saying: ‘Give this for that, take this for that, barter
this for that, get this in exchange for that,’ there is an offence of
wrong-doing. Inasmuch as it is bartered—one’s own goods gone to the hands of
another, another’s goods gone to one’s own hands—it is to be forfeited. It
should be forfeited … <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.242" href="#Vin.3.242"></a>
to an individual. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited:
<span class="kamma">‘I, honoured sirs, engaged in various kinds of bartering; this is to be
forfeited by me. I forfeit it to the Order.’</span> …
<span class="kamma">‘… the Order should give back … let the venerable ones give back … I will give
back (these goods) to the venerable one.’</span></span></p>
<p>If he thinks that it is bartering when it is bartering, there is an offence of
expiation involving forfeiture. If he is in doubt as to whether it is
bartering, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks
that it is not bartering when it is bartering, there is an offence of expiation
involving forfeiture. If he thinks that it is bartering when it is not
bartering, there <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.112" href="#BD.2.112"></a>
is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is not
bartering, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not
bartering when it is not bartering, there is no offence.</p>
<p>There is no offence if he asks the value, points it out to one who makes it
legally allowable, saying: ‘This is ours, and we want this and that’; if he is
mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
