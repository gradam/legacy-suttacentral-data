<p>Monks’ Relinquishment</p>
<h1>2. The training rule on outbuildings</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2><h3>First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.198"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.12"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-np.2.1"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="1883"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time the monks stored one of their robes with other monks and then left to travel the countryside with a lower and an upper robe. Because they were stored for a long time, the robes became moldy. The monks put them out in the sun.</p>
<p>While inspecting the dwellings, Venerable Ānanda saw the monks sunning those robes. He asked them, “Whose moldy robes are these?” And they told him what had happened. Venerable Ānanda complained and criticized them, “How can those monks store one of their robes with other monks and then leave to travel the countryside with a lower and an upper robe?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="1884"></a> After criticizing those monks in many ways, Venerable Ānanda informed the Master. … “Is it true, monks, that some monks are acting in this way?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.13"></a> “It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha criticized them, “… How can these foolish men store one of their robes with other monks and then leave to travel the countryside with a lower and an upper robe? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3>Preliminary ruling</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="1885"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘When his robe is finished and the robe-making season has ended, if a monk stays apart from his three robes even for a single day, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”</strong></p>
<p class="endsection"><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="1886"></a> In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3>Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.199"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-np.2.2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="1887"></a> At one time a certain monk in Kosambī was sick. The relatives of that monk sent him a message: “Come, Venerable, we will attend on you.”<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.14"></a> Other monks urged him to go, but he said, “The Master has laid down a training rule that you cannot be apart from your three robes. Because I am sick, I’m not able to travel with all three robes, and therefore I cannot go.”</p>
<p>They informed the Master. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:</p>
<p>“Monks, I allow you to give permission to a sick monk to stay apart from his three robes. And it should be given in this way. After approaching the Order, the sick monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, put the palms of his hands together, and say, ‘Venerables, I’m sick. I’m not able to travel with my three robes. I ask the Order for permission to stay apart from my three robes.’ And he should ask a second and a third time. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Order:</p>
<div class="kamma">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="1888"></a> ‘Venerables, let the Order listen to me. This monk so-and-so is sick. He is not able to travel with his three robes. He is asking the Order for permission to stay apart from his three robes. If it seems appropriate to the Order, the Order should give permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes. This is the motion.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="1889"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.15"></a> Venerables, let the Order listen to me. This monk so-and-so is sick. He is not able to travel with his three robes. He is asking the Order for permission to stay apart from his three robes. The Order gives permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes. Any monk who approves of giving permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes should remain silent. Any monk who does not approve should say so.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="1890"></a> The Order has given permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes. The Order approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’</p>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="1891"></a> And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="1892"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘When his robe is finished and the robe-making season has ended, if a monk stays apart from his three robes even for a single day, except if the monks have agreed, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”</strong> </p>

<hr>
<p>The robe should be relinquished to the Order, a group, or an individual.<span class="kamma"> “And, monks, it should be relinquished in this way. …<span class="add"> To be expanded as in <a href="/en/pi-tv-bu-vb-np1#13">Relinquishment 1, paragraphs 13–17</a>, with appropriate substitutions. …</span><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.16"></a> ‘Venerables, this robe which I have stayed apart from for one day without the permission of the monks is to be relinquished.
