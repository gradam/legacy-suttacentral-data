<h1>Monks’ Relinquishment 9: setting aside (2nd)</h1>
</div>
<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.9.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.58"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2041"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time a certain man said to another man, “I will give a robe to Venerable Upananda.” He replied, “I too will give a robe to Venerable Upananda.”</p>
<p>A certain monk who was an alms-collector heard that conversation. He then went to Venerable Upananda and said: “Upananda, you have much merit. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.218"></a> I have just heard two men telling each other that they will each give you a robe.”</p>
<p>Venerable Upananda replied: “They are my supporters.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2042"></a>Venerable Upananda then went to those men and said: “Is it true that you both desire to give me a robe?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, that is just what we were thinking.”</p>
<p>“If that is the case, then give me such-and-such a robe. For what is the point of giving robes that I cannot use?”</p>
<p>Then those men grumbled and complained: “These Sakyan ascetics have great desires; they are not content. It’s not easy to give them robes. How can Venerable Upananda approach us and make a suggestion about the robes without first being invited by us?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.59"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2043"></a>The monks heard the complaints of those men, and the monks of few desires … complained and criticised him: “How could Venerable Upananda approach householders and make a suggestion about a robe without first being invited?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2044"></a>After criticising Venerable Upananda in many ways, they informed the Master … “Is it true, Upananda, that you approached householders and made a suggestion about a robe without first being invited?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>“Are they relatives of yours?”</p>
<p>“No, Master.”</p>
<p>“Foolish man, people who are not related do not know what is appropriate and what is inappropriate in dealing with each other, what is right and what is wrong. And still you approached unrelated householders and made a suggestion about a robe without first being invited. This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2 class="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2045"></a>“If two male or female householders have set aside separate robe funds for an unrelated monk, thinking, ‘With these separate robe funds we will buy separate robes and supply monk so-and-so with them;’ and if that monk, without first being invited, approaches them and makes a suggestion about the robes, saying, ‘It would be good, sirs, if you would put these separate robe funds together to buy such-and-such a robe and then supply me,’ and he does so because he wants something nice, he commits and offence entailing relinquishment and confession.”</p>

<hr>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2065"></a>If those householders buy one that is long, wide, closely woven, or soft because of his statement, he commits an offence of bad conduct for the act of making the statement. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.61"></a> If he gets the robe, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment. The robe is to be relinquished to a Sangha, a group, or an individual.</p>
<p>“And, monks, it is to be relinquished in this way. … <span class="add">To be expanded as in <a href="/en/pi-tv-bu-vb-np1#Bu-NP.1.3.2">Bu-NP.1.3.2</a>, with appropriate substitutions.</span>, with appropriate substitutions. … ‘Bhante, this robe of mine, which I received after approaching unrelated householders and making a suggestion about the robes without first being invited, is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ … the Sangha should give … the Venerables should give … ‘I give this robe back to the Venerable.’”</p>
<h2 class="cakka">Permutations</h2>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2066"></a>If the householders are unrelated and he perceives them as unrelated, and, without first being invited, he approaches them and makes a suggestion about the robes, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession. If the householders are unrelated, but he has doubts about it, and, without first being invited, he approaches them and makes a suggestion about the robes, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession. If the householders are unrelated, but he perceives them as related, and, without first being invited, he approaches them and makes a suggestion about the robes, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2067"></a>If the householders are related, but he perceive them a unrelated, he commit an offence of bad conduct. If the householders are related, but he has doubts about it, he commit an offence of bad conduct. If the householders are related and he perceive them as related, there is no offence.</p>
<h2 class="anapatti">Non-offences</h2>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa2068"></a>There is no offence: if it is from relatives; if it is from those who have given an invitation; if it is for the benefit of another; if it is by means of his own property; if the householders wish to buy something expensive, but he gets them to buy something inexpensive; if he is insane; if he is the first offender.</p>
