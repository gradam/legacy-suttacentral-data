… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
at Sāvatthī robes and food were prepared for the Order by a certain guild,
saying: “Having offered them food, we will present them with robe-material.”
Then the group of six monks approached that guild, and having approached they
said to that guild: “Sirs, give these robes to us.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, we will not give; alms-food with robes are got ready by us
every year for the Order.”</p>
<p>“Sirs, many are the Order’s benefactors, many are the Order’s devotees. We are
here, depending on you, looking to you, but if you will not give to us, then
who is there who will give to us? Sirs, give these robes to us.”</p>
<p>Then that guild, being pressed by the group of six monks, giving the group of
six monks as much robe-material as was prepared, served the Order with a meal.
Those monks who knew that robe-material and a meal were prepared for the Order,
and did not know that (it) was given to the group of six monks, spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Sirs, dedicate robe-material to the Order.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.161" href="#BD.2.161"></a>
“Honoured sirs, there is none; the masters, the group of six monks,
appropriated to themselves as much robe-material as was prepared.”</p>
<p>Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the group of six monks knowingly appropriate to themselves an
apportioned benefit belonging to the Order?” Then these monks told this matter
to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, knowingly appropriated to yourselves
an apportioned benefit belonging to the Order?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, knowingly appropriate to yourselves an apportioned
benefit belonging to the Order? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who
are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set
forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should knowingly appropriate to himself an apportioned benefit
belonging to the Order, there is an offence of expiation involving
forfeiture.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… is monk to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">He knows</span> means:
<span class="gloss">either he knows by himself or others tell him or (someone) tells (him). <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.266" href="#Vin.3.266"></a>
</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Belonging to the Order</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it comes to be given to the Order, handed over to (it).</span></p>
<p><span class="term">A benefit</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the requisites of robes, alms-food, lodgings, medicine for the sick, and even a
lump of chunam and a toothpick and unwoven thread.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.162" href="#BD.2.162"></a>
<span class="term">Apportioned</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it has been expressly said, “we will give, we will make.”</span></p>
<p>If he appropriates to himself, in the action there is an offence of
wrong-doing; it is to be forfeited on acquisition. It should be forfeited to …
an individual. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: ‘Honoured sirs, this
apportioned benefit belonging to the Order, knowingly appropriated by me to
myself, is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to the Order.’ … ‘… the Order should
give back … let the venerable ones give back … I will give back this benefit to
the venerable one.’</p>
<p>If he thinks that it was apportioned when it was apportioned (and) appropriates
it to himself, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he is
in doubt as to whether it was apportioned (and) appropriates it to himself,
there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he thinks that it was
not apportioned when it was apportioned (and) appropriates it to himself, there
is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he appropriates what was
apportioned to the Order for another (part of the) Order or for a shrine, there
is an offence of wrong-doing. If he appropriates what was apportioned to a
shrine for another shrine or for an Order or for an individual, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If he appropriates what was apportioned to an
individual for another individual or for an Order or for a shrine, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it was apportioned when it was not
apportioned, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to
whether it was not apportioned, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he
thinks that it was not apportioned when it was not apportioned, there is no
offence.</p>
<p>There is no offence if he himself being asked, ‘Where <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.163" href="#BD.2.163"></a>
do we give?’ says, ‘Give wherever your gift would be used or could be mended or
should be for a long time or when for you the mind is peaceful’; if he is mad,
if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>

<p>Venerable ones, recited are the thirty rules for offences of expiation
involving forfeiture. Concerning them, I ask the venerable ones: I hope that
you are quite pure in this matter? And a second time I ask: I hope that you are
quite pure in this matter? And a third time I ask: I hope that you are quite
pure in this matter? The venerable ones are quite pure in this matter,
therefore they are silent, thus do I understand this.</p>
