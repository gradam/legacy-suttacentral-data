<p>Monks’ Relinquishment</p>
<h1>22. The training rule on less than five mends</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.245"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-np.22.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-np.22.1.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.118"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2273"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. At that time a potter had invited the monks: “If any one of you needs a bowl, I’ll provide it.” But the monks lacked a sense of moderation, and they asked for many bowls. Those who had small bowls asked for large ones, and those who had large bowls asked for small ones. The potter was so busy making bowls for the monks that he was unable to make other goods for sale. He could not make a living for himself, and his wife and children suffered. People grumbled and complained, “How can the Sakyan ascetics not have any sense of moderation and ask for many bowls? This potter is so busy making bowls for them that he is unable to make other goods for sale. He is unable to make a living for himself, and his wife and children are suffering.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2274"></a> Monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires … complained and criticized those monks, “How can those monks not have a sense of moderation and ask for many bowls?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2275"></a> After criticizing those monks in many ways, they informed the Master. … “Is it true, monks, that some monks are acting in this way?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha criticized them, “… How can those foolish men not have a sense of moderation and ask for many bowls? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it …<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.119"></a> After criticizing them, he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:<strong class="rule"> “Monks, a monk should not ask for a bowl. If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.”</strong></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-np.22.1.2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2276"></a> Soon afterwards the bowl of a certain monk broke. Knowing that the Buddha had prohibited asking for a bowl and being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not ask for a new one. As a consequence he collected almsfood with his hands. People grumbled and complained, “How can the Sakyan ascetics collect almsfood with their hands, just like ascetics of other sects?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2277"></a> Monks heard the complaints of those people and they informed the Master. Soon afterwards the Master gave a teaching and addressed the monks:<strong class="rule"> “Monks, I allow you to ask for a new bowl if your bowl has been lost or is broken.”</strong></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-np.22.1.3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2278"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.120"></a> When they knew about the Master’s allowance, monks from the group of six asked for many bowls even when their existing bowls only had a minor chip or scratch. Then that potter was once again so busy making bowls for the monks that he was unable to make other goods for sale. He could not make a living for himself, and his wife and children suffered. And people grumbled and complained as before.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.246"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2279"></a> Monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires … complained and criticized those monks, “How can those monks from the group of six ask for many bowls even if their existing bowls only have a minor chip or scratch?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2280"></a> After criticizing those monks in many ways, they informed the Master. … “Is it true, monks, that you are acting in this way?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked them: “… Foolish men, how can you ask for many bowls even if your existing bowls only have a minor chip or scratch? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2281"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk gets a new bowl in exchange for a bowl with less than five mends, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. That monk should relinquish that bowl to an assembly of monks.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.121"></a> He should then be given the last bowl belonging to that assembly: ‘Monk, this bowl is yours; keep it until it breaks.’ This is the proper procedure.’”</strong> </p>

<p>It should be relinquished in the midst of the Order. All determined bowls should be brought together.

<p><span class="kamma"> “And, monks, it should be relinquished in this way. After approaching the Order, that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, put the palms of his hands together, and say, ‘Venerables, this bowl that I got in exchange for a bowl that had less than five mends is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Order.’</span> ” After relinquishing it, he should acknowledge the offense. The acknowledgment should be received by a competent and capable monk.</p>
<p>A monk who has five qualities should be appointed as the bowl-distributor: one who is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and who knows the meaning of distributed and not distributed. “And, monks, this is how he should be appointed. First the monk should be asked and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Order:</p>
<div class="kamma">
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2285"></a> ‘Venerables, let the Order listen to me. If it seems appropriate to the Order, it should appoint monk so-and-so as the bowl-distributor. This is the motion.</p>

</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2288"></a> The appointed monk should give away that bowl. He should tell the most senior monk, “Venerable, would you like this bowl?” If the most senior monk takes it, his bowl should be offered to the next monk.<strong class="rule"> He should not not take that bowl out of sympathy. If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.</strong> It is not to be offered to anyone who does not have bowl. In this manner it should be offered all the way to the most junior monk in the Order.</p>
