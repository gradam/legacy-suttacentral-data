<p>Monks’ Relinquishment</p>
<h1>24. The training rule on rainy-season robes</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-np.24.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.134"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2323"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time the Master had allowed the rainy-season robe for the monks. Knowing that this was the case, monks from the group of six went looking for cloth for their rainy-season robes early. And after sewing them early, they wore them. Then, because their rainy-season robes were worn, they bathed naked in the rain.</p>
<p>The monks of few desires … complained and criticized them, “How can those monks from the group of six go looking for cloth for their rainy-season robes early, sew them early, and then wear them, and then, because their rainy-season robes are worn, bathe naked in the rain?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2324"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.135"></a> After criticizing those monks from the group of six in many ways, they informed the Master. … “Is it true, monks, that you did this?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked them: “… Foolish men, how can you go looking for cloth for your rainy-season robes early, sew them early, and then wear them, and then, because your rainy-season robes are worn, bathe naked in the rain? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.253"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2325"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘When there is a month left of the hot season, a monk may go looking for cloth for his rainy-season robe. When there is a half-month left, he may sew it and then wear it. If he goes looking for cloth for his rainy-season robe when there is more than a month left of the hot season, or if he sews it and then wears it when there is more than a half-month left, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”</strong> </p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-np.24.2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2326"></a><strong class="rule"> When there is a month left of the hot season, a monk may go looking for cloth for his rainy-season robe:</strong><span class="gloss"> after approaching those people who previously, too, have given cloth for the rainy-season robes, he should says, “It’s time for the rainy-season robe/it’s the occasion for the rainy-season robe/other people, too, are giving cloth for the rainy-season robe.”<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.136"></a> He should not say, “Give me cloth for the rainy-season robe/bring me cloth for the rainy-season robe/buy me cloth for the rainy-season robe/get cloth in exchange for me for the rainy-season robe.”</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2327"></a><strong class="rule"> When there is a half-month left, he may sew it and then wear it:</strong><span class="gloss"> after sewing it during the last half-month of the hot season, he may wear it.</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2328"></a><strong class="rule"> When there is more than a month left of the hot season:</strong><span class="gloss"> if he goes looking for cloth for the rainy-season robe when there is more than a month left of the hot season, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.</span></p>

<hr>
<p>The rainy-season robe should be relinquished to an Order, a group, or an individual.<span class="kamma"> “And, monks, it should be relinquished in this way. …<span class="add"> To be expanded as in <a href="/en/pi-tv-bu-vb-np1#13">Relinquishment 1, paragraphs 13–17</a>, with appropriate substitutions. …</span> ‘Venerables, this cloth for the rainy-season robe which I went looking for when there was more than a month left of the hot season and/or which I wore after sewing it when there was more than a half-month left of the hot season is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Order.’ … the Order should give … you should give … ‘I give this cloth for the rainy-season robe back to you.’”</span></p>
<h2>Permutations</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2330"></a> If there is more than a month left of the hot season, and he perceives it as more, and he goes looking for cloth for a rainy-season robe, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If there is more than a month left of the hot season, but he is unsure if there is, and he goes looking for cloth for a rainy-season robe, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If there is more than a month left of the hot season, but he perceives it as less, and he goes looking for cloth for a rainy-season robe, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2331"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.137"></a> If there is more than a half-month left of the hot season, and he perceives it as more, and he wears the rainy-season robe after sewing it, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If there is more than a half-month left of the hot season, but he is unsure if there is, and he wears the rainy-season robe after sewing it, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If there is more than a half-month left of the hot season, but he perceives it as less, and he wears the rainy-season robe after sewing it, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2332"></a><strong class="rule"> If he has a rainy-season robe, but he bathes naked in the rain, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.</strong> If there is less than a month left of the hot season, but he perceives it as more, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If there is less than a month left of the hot season, but he is unsure if there is, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If there is less than a month left of the hot season, and he perceives it as less, there is no offense.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.254"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2333"></a> If there is less than a half-month left of the hot season, but he perceives it as more, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If there is less than a half-month left of the hot season, but he is unsure if there is, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If there is less than a half-month left of the hot season, and he perceives it as less, there is no offense.</p>
<h2>Non-offenses</h2>
