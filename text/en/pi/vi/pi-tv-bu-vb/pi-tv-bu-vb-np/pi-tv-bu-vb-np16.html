… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
as a certain monk was in the country of the Kosalas going to Sāvatthī, (some)
sheep’s wool accrued (to him) on the way. Then that monk went along tying up
that sheep’s wool into a bundle with his upper robe. People, seeing this monk,
made fun of him, saying: “For how much have you bought (it), honoured sir, how
great will the profit become?”</p>
<p>This monk, being made fun of by these people, became ashamed. Then that monk,
going to Sāvatthī, threw down the sheep’s wool even as he was standing. Monks
said to this monk: “Why do you, your reverence, throw down this sheep’s wool
even as you are standing?”</p>
<p>“Because I, your reverences, was made fun of by (some) people on account of
this sheep’s wool.”</p>
<p>“But from how far have you, your reverence, conveyed this sheep’s wool?”</p>
<p>“For more than three
<i lang="pi">yojanas</i>, your reverences,” he
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.91" href="#BD.2.91"></a>
said. Then those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can this
monk convey sheep’s wool for more than three <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monk, conveyed sheep’s wool for more than
three <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, convey sheep’s wool for more than three <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And
thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“
<span class="rule">Sheep’s wool may accrue to a monk as he is going along a road. It may be
accepted by that monk, if he likes; but having accepted it, it should be
conveyed in his (own) hands for three <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> at the utmost, if there are no carriers. If he should convey it further than
that, even if there are no carriers, there is an offence of expiation involving
forfeiture.”</span>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.16.2.1" href="#Bu-NP.16.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">To a monk as he is going along a road</span> means:
<span class="gloss">as he is going on a roadway.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Sheep’s wool may accrue</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it may accrue from the Order or from a group or from a relation or from a
friend or as rag-robes or by means of his own property.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">If he likes</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">It may be accepted … but having accepted it, it should be conveyed in his (own)
hands for three <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> at the utmost</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it should be conveyed in his (own) hands for three <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> at the maximum.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">If there are no carriers</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if there is no one who is a carrier, neither a woman nor a man, nor a
householder nor one who has gone forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">If he should convey it further than that, even if there are no carriers</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he makes the first foot go beyond three
<i lang="pi">yojanas</i>, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he makes the second foot go beyond,
there is an <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.92" href="#BD.2.92"></a>
offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If standing within three <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> he lets it drop beyond the three <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he makes it go
beyond three <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>, placing it in a vehicle or a bundle of another (person) without (his) knowing
it, it is to be forfeited. It should be forfeited … to an individual. And thus,
monks, should it be forfeited: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, this sheep’s wool, made by me to go beyond three <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>, is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to the Order.’</span> …
<span class="kamma">‘… the Order should give back … let the venerable ones give back … I will give
back this sheep’s wool to the venerable one.’</span></span></p>
<p>If he makes it go beyond more than three <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> thinking them to be more, there is an offence of expiation involving
forfeiture. If, being in doubt, he makes it go beyond more than three <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If he makes it go
beyond more than three <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> thinking them to be less, there is an offence of expiation involving
forfeiture. If he thinks that it is less than three <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> when it is more, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to
whether it is less than three <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is less than three <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> when it is less, there is no offence.</p>
<p>There is no offence if he conveys it for three
<i lang="pi">yojanas</i>; if he conveys it for less than three <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>; if he conveys it for three <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> and conveys it back; if desiring a habitation, going three <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>, he conveys it beyond that; if he conveys something stolen that he has got
back; if he conveys something destroyed that he has <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.93" href="#BD.2.93"></a>
got back; if he makes another convey goods tied up in a bundle; if he is mad,
if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
