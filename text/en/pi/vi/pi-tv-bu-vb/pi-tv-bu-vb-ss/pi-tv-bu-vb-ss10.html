<h1>10. The training rule on schism in the monastic Order</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.171"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.296"></a><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="bu-ss.10.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.10.1.1"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1673"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. Just then Devadatta went to see Kokālika, Kaṭamodakatissaka, Khaṇḍadeviyā-putta, and Samuddadatta, and he said to them, “Come, let’s create a schism in the monastic Order of the ascetic Gotama, a break in transmission.”</p>
<p>Kokālika said to Devadatta, “The ascetic Gotama has great supernormal powers. How can we do this?”</p>
<p>“Well, let’s go to the ascetic Gotama and request five things:<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.297"></a> ‘Venerable Sir, in many ways the Master praises fewness of wishes, contentment, erasing of defilements, ascetic practices, being inspiring, reduction of things, and being energetic. And there are five things that lead to just that. It would be good, Venerable Sir:</p>
<ul>
<li> If the monks were forest-dwellers for life, and whoever enters a village would commit an offense</li><li> If they were alms-collectors for life, and whoever accepts an invitation would commit an offense</li><li> If they were rag-robe wearers for life, and whoever accepts a robe from a lay person would commit an offense</li><li> If they dwelt at the foot of a tree for life, and whoever takes shelter would commit an offense</li><li> If they did not eat fish and meat for life, and whoever does would commit an offense.’</li>
</ul>
<p>The ascetic Gotama won’t allow this. We’ll then be able to win people over with these five points.”</p>
<p>Kokālika said, “It might be possible to create a schism in the monastic Order with these five points, for people have confidence in austerity.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.172"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.10.1.2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1674"></a> Devadatta and his followers then went to the Master, bowed down to him, and sat down to one side. And Devadatta made his request.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.298"></a> The Master replied, “No, Devadatta. Those who wish may be forest-dwellers, and those who wish may live near a village. Those who wish may be alms-collectors, and those who wish may accept invitations. Those who wish may be rag-robe wearers, and those who wish may accept robes from lay people. I have allowed dwelling at the foot of a tree for eight months of the year, as well as fish and meat which are pure in three respects: one has not seen, heard, or suspected that the animal was specifically killed to feed a monastic.”</p>
<p>Devadatta thought, “The Master doesn’t allow the five points,” and he was glad and elated. He rose from his seat, bowed down to the Master, circumambulated him with his right side towards him, and departed with his followers.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1675"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.299"></a> Devadatta then entered Rājagaha and won people over with the five points, saying, ” “The ascetic Gotama doesn’t agree to them, but we practice in accordance with them.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1676"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.10.1.3"></a> The foolish people with little faith and confidence said, “These Sakyan ascetics are practicing asceticism and they live for the sake of erasing defilements. But the acetic Gotama lives in luxury and has chosen to live in abundance.” But the wise people who had faith and confidence complained and criticized Devadatta, “How can Devadatta act to create a schism in the monastic Order of the Master?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1677"></a> The monks heard the criticism of those people, and the monks of few desires … complained and criticized him in the same way.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1678"></a> After rebuking Devadatta in many ways, they informed the Master. … He said, “Is it true, Devadatta, that you are acting to create a schism in the Order, a break in transmission?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked him: “… Foolish man, how can you act to create a schism in the Order? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.173"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1679"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk pursues schism in a united monastic Order or persists in taking up a legal issue conducive to schism, the monks should say to him, “Venerable, donʼt pursue schism in the united monastic Order or persist in taking up a legal issue conducive to schism.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.300"></a> Stay with the Order, for a united Order—in concord, in harmony, having a joint recitation—lives in comfort.” If that monk still continues as before, the monks should admonish him up to three times to make him stop. If he then stops, that is good. If not, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”</strong> </p>
