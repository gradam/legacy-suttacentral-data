<p>Monks’ Suspension</p>
<h1>9. The second training rule on anger</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.167"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.288"></a><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="bu-ss.9.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.9.1.1"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1626"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.<span class="note" hidden>See Suspension 8, <span class="ref">MS.1.1565</span>, for a comment on the present rendering of these names.</span> On one occasion the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka were descending from Mount Vulture Peak, when they saw two goats copulating. They said to each other, “Let’s give the he-goat the name Dabba the Mallian and the she-goat the name Mettiya the nun. We can then say, ‘Earlier we spoke because of what we had heard about Dabba, but now we’ve seen him ourselves copulating with the nun Mettiya.’” They gave them those names and then informed the monks, “Earlier we spoke about what we had heard, but now we’ve seen Dabba copulating with the nun Mettiya.”</p>
<p>The monks replied, “Don’t say such a thing. Venerable Dabba wouldn’t do that.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1627"></a> The monks informed the Master. The Master had the Order of monks assembled and asked Dabba, “Dabba, do you remember doing as these monks say?”</p>
<p>“Venerable Sir, the Master knows about me.”</p>
<p>A second and a third time the Master asked the same question and got the same response.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.289"></a> He then said, “Dabba, the Dabbas donʼt give such evasive answers. If it was done by you, say so; if it wasn’t done by you, then say that.”</p>
<p>“Venerable Sir, since I was born I don’t recall having sexual intercourse even in a dream, much less when I was awake.”</p>
<p>“Well then, monks, call those monks to account,” and he rose from his seat and entered his dwelling.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.9.1.2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1628"></a> The monks then questioned Mettiya and Bhūmajaka, who told them what had happened. The monks said, “Did you accuse Venerable Dabba of an offense entailing expulsion, using an unrelated legal issue as a pretext?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The monks of few desires … complained and criticized them, “How can Mettiya and Bhūmajaka accuse Venerable Dabba in this way?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1629"></a> They rebuked those monks in many ways and then informed the Master. … He said, “Is it true, monks, that you accused Dabba the Mallian of an offense entailing expulsion, using an unrelated legal issue as a pretext?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked them: “… Foolish men, how can you accuse Dabba in this way? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.168"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1630"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.290"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk who is angry and displeased, using an unrelated legal issue as a pretext, accuses another monk of an offense entailing expulsion, aiming to make him leave the monastic life, and then after some time, whether he is questioned or not, it is clear that the legal issue is unrelated and used as a pretext, and he admits to his anger, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”</strong> </p>

<div class="gloss">
<p>It is either unrelated in regard to offenses or unrelated in regard to legal issues.</p>
<p>How is a legal issue unrelated to a legal issue? A legal issue due to a dispute is unrelated to a legal issue due to an accusation, a legal issue due to an offense, and a legal issue due to a proceeding. A legal issue due to an accusation is unrelated to a legal issue due to an offense, a legal issue due to a proceeding, and a legal issue due to a dispute. A legal issue due to an offense is unrelated to a legal issue due to a proceeding, a legal issue due to a dispute, and a legal issue due to an accusation. A legal issue due to a proceeding is unrelated to a legal issue due to a dispute, a legal issue due to an accusation, and a legal issue due to an offense. It is in this way that a legal issue is unrelated to a legal issue.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1636"></a> How is a legal issue related to a legal issue? A legal issue due to a dispute is related to a legal issue due to a dispute.

An offense entailing expulsion in regard to stealing is unrelated to an offense entailing expulsion in regard to a human being, an offense entailing expulsion in regard to a super-human quality, and an offense entailing expulsion in regard to sexual intercourse. An offense entailing expulsion in regard to a human being is unrelated to an offense entailing expulsion in regard to a super-human quality, an offense entailing expulsion in regard to sexual intercourse, and an offense entailing expulsion in regard to stealing. An offense entailing expulsion in regard to a super-human quality is unrelated to an offense entailing expulsion in regard to sexual intercourse, an offense entailing expulsion in regard to stealing, and an offense entailing expulsion in regard to a human being. It is in this way that a legal issue due to an offense is unrelated to a legal issue due to an offense.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1638"></a> How is a legal issue due to an offense related to a legal issue due to an offense?
