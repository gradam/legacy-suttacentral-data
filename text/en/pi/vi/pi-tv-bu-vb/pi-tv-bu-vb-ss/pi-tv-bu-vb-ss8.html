<h1>8. The training rule on anger</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.158"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.271"></a><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="bu-ss.8.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.8.1.1"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1556"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. At that time Venerable Dabba the Mallian had realized perfection at the age of seven. He had realized all there is to be realized by a disciple and had nothing further to do.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.272"></a> While he was in seclusion he reflected on this, and he thought, “How may I be of service to the Order of monks?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1557"></a> Perhaps I could assign the lodgings for the Order and designate the meals?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.8.1.2"></a> In the evening Dabba came out of seclusion and approached the Master. He bowed down to him, sat down to one side, and said, “Venerable Sir, while I was in seclusion I reflected that I’ve attained all that can be attained by a disciple, and I was wondering how I might be of service to the Order of monks. I thought I could assign lodgings for the Order and designate the meals.”</p>
<p>“Well then, Dabba, please do so.”</p>
<p>“Ok.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.8.1.3"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1558"></a> Soon afterwards the Master gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Monks, let the Order appoint Dabba the Mallian as the assigner of lodgings and the designator of meals. And this is how he should be appointed. First Dabba should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Order:</p>
<div class="kamma">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.159"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1559"></a> ‘Venerables, let the Order listen to me. If it seems appropriate to the Order, it should appoint Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of lodgings and as designator of meals. This is the motion.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1560"></a> Venerables, let the Order listen to me. The Order appoints Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of lodgings and as designator of meals. Any monk who approves of appointing Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of lodgings and as designator of meals should remain silent. Any monk who does not approve should say so.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1561"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.273"></a> The Order has appointed Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of lodgings and as designator of meals. The Order approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”</p>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.8.1.4"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1562"></a> And Dabba assigned lodgings to the monks according to their character. He assigned lodgings in the same place to those monks who were discourse experts, thinking, “They’ll recite the discourses together.” And he did likewise for the experts on monastic law, thinking, “They’ll deliberate on the monastic law;” for the teachers, thinking, “They’ll discuss the Teaching;” for the meditators, thinking, “They won’t disturb each other;” and for the gossips and the body-builders, thinking, “In this way even these venerables will be happy.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.274"></a> When monks arrived at night, he entered the fire element and assigned lodgings with the help of that light. Monks even arrived late on purpose, hoping to see the marvel of Dabba’s supernormal powers.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.160"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1563"></a> They would approach Dabba and say, “Venerable Dabba, assign us a lodging.”</p>
<p>“Where would you like to stay?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.275"></a> They would intentionally suggest somewhere far away, “Please give us a lodging on Mount Vulture Peak/ at Robbers’ Cliff/ on Black Rock on the slope of Mount Isigili/ in the Sattapaṇṇi Cave on the slope of Mount Vebhāra/ in Cool Grove on the hill at the Snake’s Pool/ at Gomaṭa Gorge/ at Tinduka Gorge/ at Tapoda Gorge/ in Tapoda Park/ in Jīvaka’s Mango Grove/ in the deer park at Maddakucchi.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1564"></a> Dabba then entered the fire element, and with his finger glowing, he walked in front of those monks. They followed closely behind him with the help of that light. And he would assign them lodgings: “This is the bed, this the bench, this the mattress, this the pillow, this the toilet, this the urinal, this the drinking water, this the water for other uses, this the walking stick; these are the Order’s agreements, this the time to enter, this the time to depart.” Dabba then returned to the Bamboo Grove.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.8.1.5"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1565"></a><span class="note" hidden><span class="ref">Sp.3.579.28</span> says, “just Mettiya and Bhūmajaka,” <i lang="pi">mettiyo ceva bhūmajako ca</i>. Thus, according to the commentary, the name of the second monk is Bhūmajaka rather than Bhūmaja. The commentarial explanation also means that the two names refer to just the two monks and not any followers they may have had. See also note to Suspension 13, <span class="ref">MS.1.1753</span>.</span> At that time the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka had recently been given the full ordination. They had little merit, and they obtained inferior lodgings and meals. The people of Rājagaha were keen to give specially prepared almsfood to the senior monks—ghee, oil, and special foods—<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.276"></a> but to the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka they gave ordinary food of porridge and broken rice.</p>
<p>After the meal, when they had returned from almsround, they asked the senior monks, “What did you get at the dining hall?”</p>
<p>Some said, “We got ghee, oil, and special foods.”</p>
<p>But the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said, “We didn’t get anything except ordinary food of porridge and broken rice.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.161"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.8.1.6"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1566"></a> At that time there was a householder who gave a regular meal of fine food to four monks. He made his offering in the dining hall together with his wife and children. Some of them offered rice, others curries, others oil, and others special foods.</p>
<p>On one occasion the meal to be given by this householder on the following day had been designated to the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka. Just then that householder went to the monastery on some business. He approached Dabba, bowed down to him, and sat down to one side. Dabba then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching. After the talk, he asked Dabba, “Venerable, who has been designated to receive tomorrow’s meal in our house?”</p>
<p>“Mettiya and Bhūmajaka.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.277"></a> The householder was disappointed, and he thought, “Why should bad monks eat in our house?” After returning to his house, he told a female slave, “For those who are coming for tomorrow’s meal, prepare seats on the porch and serve them broken rice and porridge.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.8.1.7"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1567"></a> But the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said to one another, “Yesterday we were designated a meal from the householder who offers fine food. Tomorrow he’ll serve us together with his wife and children. Some of them will offer us rice, others curry, others oil, and others special foods.” And because they were excited, they did not sleep properly that night.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.162"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1568"></a> After dressing the following morning, they took their bowl and robe and went to the house of that householder. When the female slave saw them coming, she prepared seats on the porch and said to them, “Please sit, Venerables.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.278"></a> They thought, “The meal can’t be ready, since we’re given seats on the porch.”</p>
<p>She then brought them broken rice and porridge and said, “Eat, Venerables.”</p>
<p>“But, Sister, we’ve come for the regular meal.”</p>
<p>“I know. But yesterday I was told by the householder to serve you in this way. Please eat.”</p>
<p>And they said to each other, “Yesterday this householder came to the monastery and spoke with Dabba. Dabba must be responsible for this split between us and this householder.” And because they were dejected, they did not eat as much as they had intended. After the meal they returned to the monastery, put their bowls and robes away, and squatted on their heels outside the monastery entrance, supported by their outer robe. They were silent and dismayed, their shoulders drooping and their heads down, glum and speechless.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.8.1.8"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.279"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1569"></a> Just then the nun Mettiyā approached them and said, “I pay respect to you, Venerables.” But they did not respond. A second time and a third time she said the same thing, but they still did not respond.</p>
<p>“Have I done something wrong? Why don’t you respond?”</p>
<p>“It’s because we’ve been badly treated by Dabba the Mallian, and you’re not taking an interest.”</p>
<p>“What can I do?”</p>
<p>“If you would like, you could make the Master eject Dabba.”</p>
<p>“What should I do? How am I able to do that?”</p>
<p>“Go to the Master and say, ‘Venerable Sir, this is not proper or appropriate. There’s fear, distress, and oppression in this district, where none of these should exist. From where one would expect security, there’s insecurity. It’s as if water is burning. Venerable Dabba the Mallian has raped me.’”</p>
<p>“Very well, sirs,” and she approached the Master, bowed down to him, and stood to one side. She then repeated what she had been told to say.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.163"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.8.1.9"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.280"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1570"></a> Soon afterwards the Master had the Order of monks assembled and asked Dabba, “Dabba, do you remember doing as the nun Mettiyā says?”</p>
<p>“Venerable Sir, the Master knows about me.”</p>
<p>A second and a third time the Master asked the same question and got the same response. He then said, “Dabba, the Dabbas don’t give such evasive answers. If it was done by you, say so; if it wasn’t done by you, then say that.”</p>
<p>“Venerable Sir, since I was born I don’t recall having sexual intercourse even in a dream, much less when I was awake.”</p>
<p>And the Master addressed the monks, “Well then, monks, eject the nun Mettiyā, and call these monks to account.” The Master then rose from his seat and entered his dwelling.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1571"></a> When the monks had ejected the nun Mettiyā, the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said to them, “Don’t eject the nun Mettiyā; she’s done nothing wrong. She was urged on by us, because we were angry, displeased, and aiming to make Dabba leave the monastic life.”</p>
<p>“But did you groundlessly accuse Dabba of an offense entailing expulsion?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The monks of few desires …<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.281"></a> complained and criticized them, “How can the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka groundlessly accuse Venerable Dabba of an offense entailing expulsion?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1572"></a> They rebuked those monks in many ways and then informed the Master. … He said, “Is it true, monks, that you groundlessly accused Dabba the Mallian of an offense entailing expulsion?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked them: “… Foolish men, how can you groundlessly accuse Dabba of an offense entailing expulsion? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1573"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk who is angry and displeased groundlessly accuses another monk of an offense entailing expulsion, aiming to make him leave the monastic life, and then after some time, whether he is questioned or not, it is clear that the legal issue is groundless, and he admits to his anger, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”</strong> </p>
