<h1>2. The training rule on physical contact</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.199"></a><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="bu-ss.2.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.2.1.1"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa993"></a> At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time Venerable Udāyī was staying in the wilderness. He had a beautiful dwelling with a room in the middle and corridors on all sides. The bed and bench were nicely made up, and the water for drinking and that for washing had been well placed. The precincts were well swept. Many people came to see Udāyī’s dwelling.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa994"></a> Among them was a certain brahmin and his wife. They approached Udāyī and said, “Venerable, we would like to have look at your dwelling.”</p>
<p>“Well then, brahmin, have a look.”</p>
<p>Udāyī took the key, unlatched the bolt, opened the door, and entered the dwelling. The brahmin entered after him and then the brahmin lady. Opening some windows and closing others, Udāyī walked around the inner room and came up from behind the brahmin lady, touching her here and there.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.200"></a> Then the brahmin thanked Udāyī and departed.</p>
<p>The brahmin then expressed his delight, “These Sakyan ascetics who live in the wilderness are superb. Venerable Udāyī is superb!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.120"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa995"></a> But the brahmin lady said, “What’s superb about him? Just as you touch me here and there, so did he.”</p>
<p>The brahmin then complained and criticized him, “These Sakyan ascetics are shameless and immoral liars. They claim to live according to the Truth, to be celibate and of good conduct, to be truthful, moral, and of good character. But they don’t have the qualities of an ascetic or a brahmin. They’ve lost the plot. How can the ascetic Udāyī touch my wife with his genitals?<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.201"></a> It’s not possible to go to a monastery or a monk’s dwelling with wives of respectable families, with daughters, girls, daughters-in-law, or female slaves of respectable families. If you do, the Sakyan ascetics might molest them.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.2.1.2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa996"></a> The monks heard the criticism of that brahmin. The monks of few desires … complained and criticized Udāyī, “How can Venerable Udāyī make physical contact with a woman?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa997"></a> They then informed the Master. The Master had the Order of monks assembled and questioned Udāyī,</p>
<p>“Is it true, Udāyī, that you made physical contact with a woman?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked him, “Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a recluse, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How can you make physical contact with a woman? Haven’t I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion … for the stilling of the fever for sense pleasures? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
