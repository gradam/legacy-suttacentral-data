<h1><span class="add"> Monks’ Suspension 4:</span> the training rule on fulfilling one’s own desires</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.132"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.222" href="#bd.1.222"></a><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="bu-ss.4.1" href="#bu-ss.4.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.4.1.1" href="#bu-ss.4.1.1"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1180" href="#ms-pa1180"></a> At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time, Venerable Udāyī was associating with and visiting a number of families in Sāvatthī.<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="vin.3.132" href="#vin.3.132"></a> Then, after dressing one morning, Udāyī took his bowl and robe and went to the house of a beautiful widow, where he sat down on the prepared seat. That woman approached Udāyī, bowed down to him, and sat down to one side. Udāyī then instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching. And she said, “Venerable, please say what you need. I’m able to give robes, almsfood, lodging requisites, and medicines.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1181" href="#ms-pa1181"></a> “It’s not hard for us, Sister, to get those requisites. Give instead what’s hard for us to get.”</p>
<p>“What’s that, Venerable?”</p>
<p>“Sexual intercourse.”</p>
<p>“Is it wanted now, Venerable?”</p>
<p>“It is, Sister.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.223" href="#bd.1.223"></a> “Come, Venerable,” and she entered her bedroom, took off her clothes, and lay back on the bed. Udāyī approached her and spat out, “Who would touch this foul-smelling wretch!” and he departed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1182" href="#ms-pa1182"></a> That woman then complained and criticized him, “These Sakyan recluses are shameless and immoral liars. They claim to live according to the Truth, to be celibate and of good conduct, to be truthful, moral, and of good character. But they don’t have the qualities of an ascetic or a brahmin; theyʼve lost the plot. How can the ascetic Udāyī request sexual intercourse from me, but then spit out, ‘Who would touch this foul-smelling wretch!’ and depart? What’s bad about me? How am I foul-smelling? In what way am I inferior to whom?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1183" href="#ms-pa1183"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.4.1.2" href="#bu-ss.4.1.2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1184" href="#ms-pa1184"></a> Other women, too, criticized him in the same way,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a> and the monks heard them. The monks of few desires …<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.224" href="#bd.1.224"></a> complained and criticized him, “How can Venerable Udāyī commend the fulfilling of his own desires in the presence of a woman?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.133"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1185" href="#ms-pa1185"></a> Those monks rebuked Udāyī in many ways and then informed the Master.<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="vin.3.133" href="#vin.3.133"></a> The Master had the Order of monks assembled and questioned Udāyī, “Is it true, Udāyī, that you commended the fulfilling of your own desires in the presence of a woman?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked him, “It’s not suitable, foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a recluse, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How can you commend the fulfilling of your own desires in the presence of a woman? Haven’t I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion … for the stilling of the fevers of sense desire? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1186" href="#ms-pa1186"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk, lustful and with a distorted mind, in the presence of a woman commends the fulfilling of his own desires:<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.225" href="#bd.1.225"></a> “Sister, she provides the highest service who attends in this way to one like me, who is virtuous, celibate, and of good character,” and if it is a reference to sexual intercourse, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”</strong> </p>
