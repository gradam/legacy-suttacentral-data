<h2>Origin story</h2><h3>First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="bu-ss.1.1" href="#bu-ss.1.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.1.1.1" href="#bu-ss.1.1.1"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa775" href="#ms-pa775"></a> At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time Venerable Seyyasaka was discontent with the spiritual life, and he became thin, haggard, and pale, his veins protruding all over his limbs. Venerable Udāyī saw him in this condition and said to him, “Seyyasaka, you’re not looking well. Are you perhaps discontent with the spiritual life?”</p>
<p>“I am.”</p>
<p>“Well then, eat as much as you like, sleep as much as you like, and bathe as much as you like. And whenever you become discontent and lustful, emit semen with your hand.”<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.193" href="#bd.1.193"></a> “But is that allowable?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do it too.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.111"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa776" href="#ms-pa776"></a> Then Seyyasaka ate, slept, and bathed as much as he liked, and whenever he became discontent and lustful, he emitted semen with his hand. After some time Seyyasaka became handsome, his features rounded, his face a good color, his skin clear. Monks who were his friends said to him, “Seyyasaka, you used to be thin, haggard, and pale, your veins protruding all over your limbs.<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="vin.3.111" href="#vin.3.111"></a> But now you’re handsome, your features rounded, your face a good color, your skin clear. Have you been taking medicine?”</p>
<p>“No, I haven’t. I just eat, sleep, and bathe as much as I like, and whenever I become discontent and lustful, I emit semen with my hand.”<a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.1.1.2" href="#bu-ss.1.1.2"></a> “Do you eat the almsfood of the faithful with the same hand you use to emit semen?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The monks of few desires …<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.194" href="#bd.1.194"></a> complained and criticized him, “How can Venerable Seyyasaka emit semen with his hand?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.112"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa777" href="#ms-pa777"></a> They rebuked Seyyasaka in many ways and then informed the Master. The Master then had the Order of monks assembled and questioned Seyyasaka, “Is it true, Seyyasaka, that you emit semen with your hand?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked him, “Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How can you emit semen with your hand? Havenʼt I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion; for freedom from bondage, not for the sake of bondage; for the sake of non-grasping, not for the sake of grasping? When I’ve taught in this way, how can you be intent on passion, bondage, and grasping? Havenʼt I given many teachings for the fading away of lust, for the clearing away of intoxication, for the removal of thirst, for the uprooting of attachment, for the cutting off of the round of birth and death, for the ending of craving, for fading away, for cessation, for extinguishment?<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.195" href="#bd.1.195"></a> Haven’t I given many teachings the abandoning of sense pleasures, the full understanding of the perceptions of sense pleasure, the removal of thirst for sense pleasures, the elimination of thoughts of sense pleasures, the stilling of the fever of sense pleasures? Foolish man, this will not give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it, but it will hinder confidence in those without it, and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.”<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="vin.3.112" href="#vin.3.112"></a> Then, after rebuking Seyyasaka in many ways for being difficult to support … the Master said, “And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3>Preliminary ruling</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="ms-pa" href="#ms-pa778" id="ms-pa778"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘Intentional emission of semen is an offense entailing suspension.’”</strong></p>
<p class="endsection>"><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa779" href="#ms-pa779"></a> In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3>Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="bu-ss.1.2" href="#bu-ss.1.2"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.1.2.1" href="#bu-ss.1.2.1"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa780" href="#ms-pa780"></a> At one time, monks ate delicious food, fell asleep without mindfulness and clear comprehension, and emitted semen while dreaming.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.196" href="#bd.1.196"></a> They became remorseful, thinking, “The Master has laid down a training rule that intentional emission of semen is an offense entailing suspension. We had an emission of semen while dreaming, and that involves intention. Could it be that we’ve committed an offense entailing suspension?” They informed the Master. He said, “Monks, there’s intention involved, but it’s negligible. And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘Intentional emission of semen, except while dreaming, is an offense entailing suspension.’”</strong> </p>

This is the name and designation of this class of offense. Therefore, too, it is called “an offense entailing suspension.”</span></p>
