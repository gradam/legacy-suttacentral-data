</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2><h3>First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.135"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.229"></a><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="bu-ss.5.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.5.1.1"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1220"></a> At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time Venerable Udāyī was associating with and visiting a number of families in Sāvatthī.</p>
<p>At this time, when Udāyī saw a young man without a wife or a young woman without a husband, he would praise the young woman in the presence of the parents of the young man, “The young woman of such-and such a family is beautiful, intelligent, skilled, and diligent. She is suitable for your son.” They would reply, “Venerable, they don’t know who we are. If you would persuade them to give the girl, we would take her for our son.”</p>
<p>And he praised the young man in the presence of the parents of the young woman, “The young man of such-and-such a family is handsome, intelligent, skilled, and diligent. He is suitable for your daughter.” They would reply, “Venerable, they don’t know who we are, and we would be ashamed to speak to them for the sake of the girl. But if you would persuade them to ask us, we would give our girl to the young man.”<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.230"></a> In this way he arranged for the taking of a bride, for the giving of a bride, and for marriage.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.5.1.2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1221"></a> At this time, there was a certain former courtesan who had a beautiful daughter. On one occasion, some lay followers of the Ājīvaka sect came from another village and said to that courtesan, “Lady, please give your girl to our boy.”</p>
<p>“Sirs, I don’t know who you are. And I won’t give my only daughter to be taken to another village.”</p>
<p>Some people asked those Ājīvaka lay followers why they had come, and they replied, “We came to ask that courtesan to give her daughter to our son, but she has refused.”</p>
<p>“But why did you ask the courtesan? You should speak to Udāyī. He’ll persuade her.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.136"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1222"></a> They then approached Udāyī and said, “Venerable, we’ve asked that courtesan here to give her daughter to our son, but she has refused. Would you please persuade her to give us her daughter?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1223"></a> Udāyī agreed. Soon afterwards he went to that courtesan and said, “Why didn’t you give them your daughter?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know who they are, Venerable, and I won’t give my only daughter to be taken to another village.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.231"></a> “I know them. Please give her to them.”</p>
<p>“If you know them, Venerable, I’ll give her.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.5.1.3"></a> She then gave her daughter to those Ājīvaka followers, and they took her away. For a month they treated her like a daughter-in-law, but after that like a slave.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1224"></a> The girl sent a message to her mother: “Mum, I’m unhappy and miserable. For a month they treated me like a daughter-in-law, but after that like a slave. Come, mum, and take me home.”</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, the courtesan went to those Ājīvakas and said, “Sirs, please don’t treat my girl like a slave, but like a daughter-in-law.”</p>
<p>They replied, “We deal with the ascetic, not with you. Go away! We don’t want to know you.” Being dismissed, she returned to Sāvatthī.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1225"></a> A second time the girl sent the same message to her mother. That courtesan then approached Udāyī and said, “Venerable, my girl is unhappy and miserable.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.232"></a> They treated her like a daughter-in-law for a month, but then like a slave. Please tell them to treat her like a daughter-in-law.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.137"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1226"></a> And Udāyī went to the Ājīvakas and said, “Sirs, don’t treat this girl like a slave, but like a daughter-in-law.”</p>
<p>“We deal with the courtesan, not with you. An ascetic shouldn’t get involved; you should behave like a good ascetic. Go away! We don’t want to know you.” Being dismissed, he returned to Sāvatthī.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1227"></a> A third time that girl sent the same message to her mother, and a second time the courtesan approached Udāyī and told him the same thing.</p>
<p>He replied, “When I went the first time, they just dismissed me. Please go yourself. I’m not going.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.5.1.4"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1228"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.233"></a> Then that courtesan complained and criticized him, “May Venerable Udāyī be miserable and unhappy, just as my girl is miserable and unhappy because of her nasty mother-in-law, nasty father-in-law, and nasty husband.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1229"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1230"></a> And the girl, too, complained and criticized him in the same way,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a> as did other women who were unhappy with their mothers-in-law, their fathers-in-law, and their husbands.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1231"></a> But those women who were happy with their mothers-in-law, their fathers-in-law, and their husbands wished him well, “May Venerable Udāyī be happy and well, just as we are happy and well because of our good mothers-in-law, good fathers-in-law, and good husbands.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.5.1.5"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1232"></a> The monks heard that some women were criticizing him whereas others were wishing him well. And the monks of few desires … complained and criticized him, “How can Venerable Udāyī act as a matchmaker?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1233"></a> They informed the Master.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.234"></a> The Master had the Order of monks assembled and questioned Udāyī, “Is it true, Udāyī, that you acted as a matchmaker?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked him, “… Foolish man, how can you act as a matchmaker? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3>Preliminary ruling</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.138"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1234"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk mediates a man’s intentions to a woman or a woman’s intentions to a man, for marriage or for an affair, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”</strong></p>
<p class="endsection"><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1235"></a> In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3>Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="bu-ss.5.2"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.5.2.1"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1236"></a> Soon afterwards, a number of low-minded men who were amusing themselves in a pleasure grove sent a messenger to a prostitute: “Please come; let’s enjoy ourselves in the pleasure grove.”</p>
<p>She replied, “Sirs, I don’t know who you are. I already have much wealth, and I don’t want to go outside the city.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1237"></a> The messenger returned the message. A certain man then said to those men, “Why did you ask the prostitute? You should’ve spoken to Venerable Udāyī. He’ll persuade her.”</p>
<p>But a certain Buddhist lay follower said, “No way. That’s not allowable for the Sakyan ascetics. Venerable Udāyī won’t do it.” And they made a bet on whether he would.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1238"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.235"></a> Those low-minded men approached Udāyī and said, “Venerable, while we were enjoying ourselves in the pleasure grove, we sent a message to such-and-such a prostitute, asking her to come, but she refused. Would you please persuade her?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1239"></a> Udāyī agreed. And he went to that prostitute and said, “Why don’t you go to those men?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know them, Venerable.”</p>
<p>“I know them. Please go.”</p>
<p>“If you know them, Venerable, I’ll go.” And those men took her to the pleasure grove.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.5.2.2"></a> Then that lay follower complained and criticized him, “How can Venerable Udāyī act as a matchmaker for a brief affair?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1240"></a> The monks heard it, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How can Venerable Udāyī act as a matchmaker for a brief affair?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="22"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.139"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1241"></a> They rebuked Udāyī in many ways and then informed the Master. … “Is it true, Udāyī, that you acted as a matchmaker for a brief affair?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked him, “… Foolish man, how can you act as a matchmaker for a brief affair? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
