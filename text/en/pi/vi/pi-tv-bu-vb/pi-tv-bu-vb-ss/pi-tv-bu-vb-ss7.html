<h1>7. The training rule on building dwellings</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.156"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.266"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.7.1"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1512"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Monastery. At that time a householder who was a supporter of Venerable Channa said to him, “Venerable, please find a site for a dwelling, and I’ll have one built for you.”</p>
<p>While Venerable Channa was clearing a site for that dwelling, he had a tree felled that had served as a shrine and that was revered by village, town, district, and kingdom. People grumbled and complained, “How can the Sakyan ascetics have such a tree felled? They are hurting life with one faculty.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1513"></a> The monks heard the criticism of those people, and the monks of few desires …<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.267"></a> complained and criticized Venerable Channa in the same manner.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1514"></a> After criticizing Venerable Channa in various ways, they informed the Master. … He said, “Is it true, Channa, that you had a tree felled that had served as a shrine and that was revered by village, town, district, and kingdom?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked him: “… Foolish man, how can you do such a thing? People perceive trees as living beings. This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><strong class="rule"><span class="note" hidden>I have rendered <i lang="pi">sassāmikaṃ</i> as “with a sponsoring owner.” The word <i lang="pi">sāmika</i> generally means “owner,” and there seems to be no reason why that should not also be the meaning here. However, although the monk does not own the dwelling, he is still the builder and the intended user once the building is finished. To indicate this, I have added the word “sponsoring.”</span> ‘When a monk builds a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for himself, he must get monks to approve a site where no harm will be done and which has a space on all sides. If a monk builds a large dwelling on a site where harm will be done and which lacks a space on all sides, or he does not get monks to approve the site, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”</strong> </p>

<div class="gloss">
<p>The monk who is building a dwelling should clear a site, then approach the Order of monks, put his robe over one shoulder, bow down at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels with his palms together, and say,<span class="kamma"> “Venerables, I wish to build a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for myself. I request the Order to inspect the site for the dwelling.” He should make his request a second and a third time.</span> If the whole Order is able to inspect the site, they should all go. If the whole Order is not able to inspect the site, then those monks there who are competent and capable—who know where harm will be done and where no harm will be done, and who knows what is meant by a space on all sides and a lacks a space on all sides— should be asked and then appointed.</p>
<p>“And, monks, they should be appointed in this way. A competent and capable monk should inform the Order:</p>
<div class="kamma">
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1522"></a> ‘Venerables, let the Order listen to me. Monk so-and-so wishes to build a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for himself. He is requesting the Order to inspect the site for the dwelling. If it seems appropriate to the Order, the Order should appoint monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to inspect the site. This is the motion.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1523"></a> Venerables, let the Order listen to me.

The Order is appointing monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to inspect the site. Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to inspect the site for the dwelling should remain silent. Any monk who does not approve should say so.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1524"></a> Monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so have been appointed by the Order to inspect the site for the dwelling of monk so-and-so. The Order approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’</p>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1525"></a> The appointed monks should go and inspect the site for the dwelling to find out if any harm will be done and if it has a space on all sides. If harm will be done and it lacks a space on all sides, they should say, ‘Don’t build here.’ If no harm will be done and it has a space on all sides, they should inform the Order: ‘No harm will be done and it has a space on all sides.’ The monk who is building the dwelling should then approach the Order, put his robe over one shoulder, bow down at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels with his palms together, and say,<span class="kamma"> ‘Venerables, I wish to build a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for myself.
