at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks knowingly opened up for a further (formal) act a legal
question settled according to rule, saying:</p>
<p>“The (formal) act is not carried out, the (formal) act is badly carried out,
the (formal) act should be carried out again, it is not settled, it is badly
settled, it should be settled again.”</p>
<p>Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of
six monks knowingly open up … ‘… it should be settled again’?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, knowingly opened up … ‘… it should be
settled again’?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, knowingly open up … ‘… it should be settled again’?”
It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And
thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should knowingly open up for a further (formal) act a legal
question settled according to rule, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.63.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.63.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… monk is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">He knows</span> means:
<span class="gloss">either he knows by himself, or others tell him, or (someone) tells him.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.6" href="#BD.3.6"></a>
<span class="term">According to rule</span> means:
<span class="gloss">carried out according to rule, according to discipline, according to the
teacher’s instruction, this means according to rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Legal question</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there are four (kinds of) legal questions: legal questions arising out of
disputes, legal questions arising out of censure, legal questions arising out
of transgressions, legal questions arising out of obligations.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should open up for a further (formal) act</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he opens it up, thinking: ‘The (formal) act was not carried out, the
(formal) act was badly carried out, the (formal) act should be carried out
again, it was not settled, it was badly settled, it should be settled again,’
there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.63.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.63.2.2"></a>
If he thinks that it is a legally valid act when it is a legally valid act,
(and) opens it up, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to
whether it is a legally valid act, (and) opens it up, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not a legally valid act when it is a
legally valid act, there is no offence. If he thinks that it is a legally valid
act when it is not a legally valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If
he is in doubt as to whether it is not a legally valid act, there is an offence
of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not a legally valid act when it is not
a legally valid act, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.63.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.63.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if he opens it up knowingly, thinking: ‘The (formal) act
was carried out according to what is not the rule, or by an incomplete
congregation, or against one who is not suitable for a (formal) act’; if he is
mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
