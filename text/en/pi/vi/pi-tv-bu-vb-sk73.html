… in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks eased
themselves standing</p>
<p>‘I will not ease myself standing if not ill,’ is a training to be observed.”</p>
<p>One must not ease oneself standing if not ill. Whoever out of disrespect eases
himself standing if not ill, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>There is no offence if it is unintentional, … if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
