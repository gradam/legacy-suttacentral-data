… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
nuns, having had raw grain asked for at harvest time, carried it towards the
town. (Those) at the gateway, saying: “Ladies, give a portion,” having
obstructed (them) let (them) go. Then these nuns, having gone to a dwelling,
told this matter to the nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about,
saying: “How can these nuns have raw grain asked for?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nuns had raw grain asked for?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns have raw grain asked for? It is not, monks, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, having asked for raw grain or having had it asked for, or having
roasted it or having caused it to be roasted, or having pounded it or having
caused it to be pounded, or having cooked it or having caused it to be cooked,
should eat it, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p>If she says, “I will eat it” (and) <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.265" href="#Vin.4.265"></a>
accepts it, there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful, there is an
offence of expiation.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.7.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.7.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if it is because of illness, if she has pulses asked for;
if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
