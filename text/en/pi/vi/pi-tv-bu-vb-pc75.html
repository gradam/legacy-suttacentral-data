… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks, angry, displeased, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.147" href="#Vin.4.147"></a>
raised the palm of the hand against the group of seventeen monks. These,
frightened of a blow, cried out. Monks spoke thus: “Why do you, your
reverences, cry out?”</p>
<p>“Your reverences, this group of six monks, angry, displeased, raised the palm
of the hand against us.” Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:
“How can this group of six monks, angry, displeased, raise the palm of the hand
against the group of seventeen monks?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, angry, displeased, raised the palm of
the hand against the group of seventeen monks?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">How can you, foolish men, angry, displeased, raise the palm of the hand against
the group of seventeen monks? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who
are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set
forth: <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.50" href="#BD.3.50"></a>
Whatever monk, angry, displeased, should raise the palm of the hand against a
monk, there is an offence of expiation.</span>”</p>

<p><span class="term">Against a monk</span> means:
<span class="gloss">against another monk.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Angry, displeased</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… stubborn.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should raise the palm of the hand</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he lifts up the body or something attached to the body, and even at most a
lotus-leaf, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

If he thinks that one is ordained when he is ordained, (and) angry, displeased,
raises the palm of the hand … <span class="add">see <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bu-vb-pc74#Bu-Pc.74.2">Bu-Pc.74.2</a></span>… There is no offence if, being in some difficulty, he raises the palm of the
hand desiring freedom; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
