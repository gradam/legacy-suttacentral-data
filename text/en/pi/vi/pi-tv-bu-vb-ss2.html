At one time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta
Grove in Anāthapiṇdika’s park. At that time the venerable Udāyin lived in the
jungle. The dwelling of the venerable one was lovely, good to look upon,
beautiful, the inner chamber in the middle was entirely surrounded by the
house; the couch and chair, the bolster and pillow were well designed, the
water used for drinking and that used for washing were well placed; the cell
was well swept. Many people came to look at the dwelling of the venerable
Udāyin, and a certain brahmin together with his wife approached the venerable
Udāyin, and having approached the venerable Udāyin, he said: “We want to see
the dwelling of the good Udāyin.”</p>
<p>“Do look at it, brahmin,” he said, and taking the key, unfastening the bolt,
and opening the door, he entered the dwelling. The brahmin entered after the
venerable Udāyin, and the brahmin lady entered behind the brahmin. Then the
venerable. Udāyin, opening some windows and closing others, going round about
the inner room, and coming up from behind, rubbed up against the brahmin lady
limb by limb. Then the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.200" href="#BD.1.200"></a>
brahmin, having exchanged greetings with the venerable Udāyin, went away. Then
the brahmin, who was pleased, burst out with a cry of pleasure: “Superb are
these recluses, sons of the Sakyans; who dwell in such a jungle, superb is the
revered Udāyin who dwells in such a jungle.”</p>
<p>Having spoken thus, the brahmin lady said to the brahmin: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.120" href="#Vin.3.120"></a>
</p>
<p>“What is there superb about him? Even as you rubbed up against me limb by limb,
so did this recluse Udāyin rub up against me limb by limb.”</p>
<p>Then the brahmin became annoyed, vexed, angry and said:</p>
<p>“These recluses, sons of the Sakyans, are shameless, of low morality, liars.
And they pretend to be walking by <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, walking by right, leading the Brahma-life, speaking truth, virtuous, of good
conduct. Among these there is no recluseship, among these there is no
brahminhood. Perished is recluseship among these, perished is brahminhood among
these. Where is recluseship among these? Where is brahminhood among these?
Fallen from recluseship are these, fallen from brahminhood are these. How can
this recluse Udāyin rub up against my wife limb by limb? It is not possible to
go to the park or dwelling with wives of respectable families, with daughters
of respectable families, with girls of respectable families, with
daughters-in-law of respectable families, with women-slaves of respectable <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.201" href="#BD.1.201"></a>
families. If wives of respectable families, daughters of respectable families,
girls of respectable families, daughters-in-law of respectable families,
women-slaves of respectable families should go to a park or dwelling, the
recluses, sons of the Sakyans, may assault them.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.2.1.2" href="#Bu-Ss.2.1.2"></a>
The monks heard this brahmin as he was grumbling, murmuring, and becoming
angry. Those who were modest monks became annoyed, vexed, angry and said: “How
can the reverend Udāyin come into bodily contact with women-kind?” Then these
monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord on this occasion, for this
reason, causing the Order of monks to be convened, asked the reverend Udāyin:</p>
<p>“Is it true as they say, Udāyin, that you came into bodily contact with a
woman?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>Then the enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“It is not right, foolish man, it is not becoming, it is not suitable, it is
not fit in a recluse, it is not proper, it is not to be done. How can you,
foolish man, come into bodily contact with a woman? Foolish man, is not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> uttered by me in various ways for the sake of stilling passion, and not for
the sake of passion … declared the allaying of the flames of the pleasures of
the senses? It is not, foolish man, for the benefit of unbelievers … Thus,
monks, this course of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, affected by desire, with perverted heart, should come into
physical contact with a woman, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.202" href="#BD.1.202"></a>
