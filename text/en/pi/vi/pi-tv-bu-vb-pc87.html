… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, was lying down on a high couch.
Then the lord, as he was touring the lodgings together with several monks, came
up to the dwelling-place of the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans. The
venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, saw the lord coming from afar, and
seeing him, he spoke thus to the lord: “Lord, let the lord come, let him lie
down on my bed.”</p>
<p>Then the lord, having turned back from there, addressed the monks, saying:
“Monks, the foolish man should be spoken to about his abode.”</p>
<p>Then the lord, having in many a figure rebuked the venerable Upananda, the son
of the Sakyans, for his difficulty in maintaining himself … “… And thus, monks,
this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">When a new couch or chair is being made for a monk, the legs should be made
eight finger-breadths (high) according to the accepted finger-breadth, except
for the knotched ends below. In exceeding this (measure), there is an offence
of expiation involving cutting down.”</span></p>

<span class="term">New</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is so called with reference to the making.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Couch</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there are four (kinds of) couch: a long one, one with slats, one with curved
legs, one with removable legs.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Chair</span>means:
<span class="gloss">there are four (kinds of) chair: a long one, one with slats, one with curved
legs, one with removable legs.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Is being made</span> means:
<span class="gloss">making or causing to be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">The legs should be made eight finger-breadths (high) according to the accepted
finger-breadth, except <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.169" href="#Vin.4.169"></a>
for the knotched ends below</span> means:
<span class="gloss">setting aside the knotched ends below. If he makes it or causes it to be made
exceeding this (measure), in the business there is an offence of wrong-doing;
having cut it down on acquisition, an offence of expiation is to be confessed.</span></p>
<p>If what was incompletely executed by himself he has finished by himself … <span class="add">see <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bu-vb-pc86#Bu-Pc.86.2.1">Bu-Pc.86.2.1</a></span> … If he makes others finish what was incompletely executed by others, there is
an offence of expiation. If he makes it or causes it to be made for another,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If, having acquired what was made for
another, he makes use of it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.87.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.87.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if he makes it to the (proper) measure; if he makes it less
than the (proper) measure; if, having acquired what was made for another, (but)
exceeding the (proper) measure, having cut it down, he makes use of it; if he
is mad, if he is the first wrongdoer.</p>
