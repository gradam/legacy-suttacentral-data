… among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks, having approached a nunnery, exhorted the group of six
nuns. Nuns spoke thus to the group of six nuns: “Come, ladies, we will go for
exhortation.”</p>
<p>“Well, ladies, we would go for the sake of exhortation, (but) the group of the
six masters exhort us, having come to this place itself.” Those who were modest
nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six nuns not go for
exhortation?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six nuns do not go for
exhortation?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the group of six nuns <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.315" href="#Vin.4.315"></a>
not go for exhortation? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet)
pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should not go for exhortation or for communion, there is an
offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bi-Pc.58.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.58.2.1" href="#Bi-Pc.58.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Exhortation</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the eight important rules. </span></p>
<p><span class="term">Communion</span> means:
<span class="gloss">one (formal) act, one recitation, an equal training. If she thinks, “I will not
go for <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.357" href="#BD.3.357"></a>
exhortation or for communion,” in throwing off the responsibility, there is an
offence of expiation.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.58.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.58.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if there is an obstacle; if, having looked about for a nun
as a companion, she does not get the chance; if she is ill; if there are
accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
