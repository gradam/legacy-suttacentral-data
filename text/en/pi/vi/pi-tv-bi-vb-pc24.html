… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
nuns, having entrusted robes to the hands of (other) nuns, set out on a tour of
the country with (only) the inner and the upper robes. Those robes, deposited
for a long time, became soiled; nuns dried them in the sun. Nuns spoke thus to
these nuns: “Ladies, whose are these robes that are soiled?” Then these nuns
told this matter to the nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about,
saying: “How can nuns, having entrusted robes to the hands of (other) nuns, set
out on a tour of the country with (only) the inner and the upper robes?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns … with (only) the inner and the upper
robes?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns … with (only) the inner and the upper robes? It is not,
monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should miss going about in an outer cloak for five days, there is
an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bi-Pc.24.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.24.2.1" href="#Bi-Pc.24.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.291" href="#BD.3.291"></a>
<span class="term">Should miss going about in an outer cloak for five days</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if on the fifth day she neither dresses in nor puts on nor dries in the sun the
five robes, (but) lets the fifth day pass, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.24.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.24.2.2"></a>
If she thinks that five days are passed when they are passed, there is an
offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as to whether five days are passed,
there is an offence of expiation. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.282" href="#Vin.4.282"></a>
If she thinks that five days are not passed when they are passed, there is an
offence of expiation. If she thinks that five days are passed when they are not
passed, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether
five days are not passed, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks
that five days are not passed when they are not passed, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.24.2.3" href="#Bi-Pc.24.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if, on the fifth day, she dresses in or puts on or dries
the five robes in the sun; if she is ill; if there are accidents; if she is
mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
