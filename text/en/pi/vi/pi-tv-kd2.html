At one time the awakened one, the Lord was staying near Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Now at that time wanderers belonging to other sects, having collected together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month, spoke <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, People came up to them to hear <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. They gained affection for the wanderers belonging to other sects, they gained faith (in them), the wanderers belonging to other sects gained adherents.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.1.2" href="#Kd.2.1.2"></a>
Then reasoning arose thus in the mind of King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha as he was meditating in seclusion: “At present wanderers belonging to other sects, having collected together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month, speak <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. These people go up to them to hear <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. They gain affection for the wanderers belonging to other sects, they gain faith (in them), the wanderers belonging to other sects gain adherents. Suppose the masters should also collect together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.1.3" href="#Kd.2.1.3"></a>
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance, As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha spoke thus to the Lord: “Now, Lord, as I was meditating in seclusion, a reasoning arose in my mind thus: ‘At present wanderers belonging to other sects … should collect together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month?’”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.1.4" href="#Kd.2.1.4"></a>
Then the Lord gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, gladdened, … delighted by the Lord with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, rising from his seat,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.1.102" href="#Vin.1.102"></a>
 having greeted the Lord, departed keeping his right side towards him. Then the Lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>
“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to assemble together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month.</span>” </p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.2.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.2.1" href="#Kd.2.2.1"></a>
Now at that time monks, thinking: “It is allowed by the Lord to assemble together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month,” having assembled together, sat down in silence. Those people came up to hear <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. They looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, having assembled together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month, sit in silence, like dumb pigs? Ought not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to be spoken when they are assembled together?” Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>
“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, having assembled together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month, to speak <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.</span>”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.2.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.3.1" href="#Kd.2.3.1"></a>
Then as the Lord was meditating in seclusion a reasoning arose in his mind thus: “What now if I were to allow those rules of training, laid down by me for monks, (to form) a recital of Pātimokkha for them? It would be a (formal) act of observance for them.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.3.2" href="#Kd.2.3.2"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.132" href="#BD.4.132"></a>
Then the Lord, having emerged from his seclusion in the evening, on this occasion, in this connection having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying: “Now, monks, as I was meditating in seclusion a reasoning arose in my mind thus: ‘What now if I should allow those rules of training, laid down by me for monks, (to form) a recital of Pātimokkha for them? It would be a (formal) act of observance for them’.
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to recite a Pātimokkha.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.3.3" href="#Kd.2.3.3"></a>
“And thus, monks, should it be recited: The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. Today, the fifteenth (day), is an Observance (day). If it seems right to the Order, the Order may carry out Observance, it may recite the Pātimokkha. What is the Order’s first duty? Let the venerable ones
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.1.103" href="#Vin.1.103"></a>
 announce entire purity. I will recite the Pātimokkha (while) one and all of us present listen properly and pay attention to it. He for whom there may be an offence should reveal it. If there is no offence, you should become silent. By your becoming silent I shall thus know that the venerable ones are quite pure. For as there is an answer for each question, so it is proclaimed up to the third time in an assembly like this. Whatever monk remembering while it is being proclaimed up to the third time that there is an existent offence and should not reveal it, there comes to be conscious lying for him. Now, conscious lying, venerable ones, is a thing called a stumbling-block by the Lord. Therefore the existent offence should be revealed
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.133" href="#BD.4.133"></a>
 by a monk who remembers that he has fallen (into an offence) and who desires purity; for when it is revealed there comes to be comfort for him.</span>’”</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.2.4"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.4.1" href="#Kd.2.4.1"></a>
Now at that time monks, thinking: “The recital of the Pātimokkha is allowed by the Lord,” recited the Pātimokkha daily. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>
“
<span class="rule">Monks, the Pātimokkha should not be recited daily. Whoever should (so) recite it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to recite the Pātimokkha on an Observance day.</span>”</p>
.
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.4.2" href="#Kd.2.4.2"></a>
Now at that time monks, thinking: “The recital of the Pātimokkha on an Observance day is allowed by the Lord,” recited the Pātimokkha three times during the half-month—on the fourteenth, on the fifteenth and on the eighth (days) of the half-month. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>
“
<span class="rule">Monks, the Pātimokkha should not be recited three times <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.136" href="#BD.4.136"></a>
 in the half-month. Whoever should (so) recite it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to recite the Pātimokkha once in the half-month: either on this fourteenth or on the fifteenth (day).</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.2.5"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.5.1" href="#Kd.2.5.1"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks recited the Pātimokkha according to assembly, each one before his own assembly. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>
“
<span class="rule">Monks, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.1.105" href="#Vin.1.105"></a>
 the Pātimokkha should not be recited according to assembly, each one before his own assembly, Whoever should (so) recite it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a (formal) act of Observance for all together.”</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.5.2 " href="#Kd.2.5.2%20"></a>
Then it occurred to the monks: “A (formal) act of Observance for all together is allowed by the Lord. Now, how far does ‘being all together’ (go)? As far as one residence, or the whole earth?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.5.3" href="#Kd.2.5.3"></a>
“<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, ‘being all together’ (to mean) as far as one residence.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time the venerable Kappina the Great was staying near Rājagaha at Maddakucchi in the deer-park. Then as the venerable Kappina the Great was meditating in seclusion a reasoning arose in his mind thus: “Should I go to an Observance or should I not go, should I go to a (formal) act of the Order or should I not go, I, nevertheless, am purified with the highest purification.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.5.4" href="#Kd.2.5.4"></a>
Then the Lord, knowing by mind the reasoning in the mind of the venerable Kappina the Great, as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or might bend back his outstretched arm, even so did he, vanishing from Mount Vulture Peak appear in Maddakucchi in the deer-park before the
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.137" href="#BD.4.137"></a>
 venerable Kappina the Great. The Lord sat down on an appointed seat, and the venerable Kappina the Great, having greeted the Lord, sat down at a respectful distance.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.5.5" href="#Kd.2.5.5"></a>
As the venerable Kappina the Great was sitting down at a respectful distance the Lord spoke thus to him: “Now, Kappina, as you were meditating in seclusion did not a reasoning arise in your mind thus: ‘Should I go to an Observance or should I not go, should I go to a (formal) act of the Order or should I not go, I, nevertheless, am purified with the highest purification’?” </p>
<p>“Yes, Lord.”</p>
<p>“But if you brahmans do not reverence, revere, esteem, honour the Observance, who is there who will reverence, revere, esteem, honour the Observance? You go along, brahman, to the Observance, do not not go; go likewise to a (formal) act of the Order, do not not go.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Lord,” the venerable Kappina the Great answered the Lord in assent.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.5.6" href="#Kd.2.5.6"></a>
Then the Lord, having gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted the venerable Kappina the Great with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or bend back his outstretched arm, even so did he, vanishing from before the venerable Kappina the Great in Maddakucchi in the deer-park appear on Mount Vulture Peak.

<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.2.6"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.6.1" href="#Kd.2.6.1"></a>
Then it occurred to the monks: “It is laid down by the Lord that ‘being all together’ (means) as far as one residence. Now, how far does one residence (go)?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>
“
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to agree upon a boundary.</span> And thus, monks, should it be agreed upon: First, marks should be announced, a mark consisting of a hillside, a mark consisting of a rock, a mark consisting of a grove, a mark consisting of a tree, a mark consisting of a road, a mark consisting of an anthill, a mark consisting of a river, a mark consisting of (a piece of) water. The Order, having announced the marks, should be informed by an experienced, competent
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.138" href="#BD.4.138"></a>
 monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. In as much as marks all round are announced, if it seems right to the Order the Order may agree upon a boundary in accordance with these marks for the same communion for one Observance. This is the motion. <a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.6.2" href="#Kd.2.6.2"></a>
 Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. In as much as marks all round are announced, the Order is agreeing upon a boundary in accordance with these marks for the same communion, for one Observance. If the agreement upon a boundary in accordance with these marks for the same communion, for one Observance, is pleasing to the venerable ones, they should be silent; he to whom it is not pleasing should speak. The boundary in accordance with these marks is agreed upon by the Order for the same communion, for one Observance. It is pleasing to the Order, therefore it is silent; thus do I understand this</span>’.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.2.7"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.7.1" href="#Kd.2.7.1"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks, thinking: “An agreement upon a boundary is allowed by the Lord,” agreed upon very extensive boundaries, of four <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> and five <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> and six <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>. Monks coming for Observance arrived while the Pātimokkha was being recited, and they arrived just after it had been recited, and they stayed (a night) on the way. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>
“
<span class="rule">Monks, a very extensive boundary should not be agreed upon, of four <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> or five <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> or six <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>. Whoever should (so) agree, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to agree upon a boundary of three <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> at most.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.7.2" href="#Kd.2.7.2"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks agreed upon the other side of a river as a boundary. Monks coming for Observance were carried away and their bowls were carried away and their robes were carried away. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>
“
<span class="rule">Monks, the other side of a river should not be agreed upon as a boundary. Whoever should (so) agree, there is an <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.139" href="#BD.4.139"></a>
 offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, when there may be a reliable boat or a reliable bridge to agree upon the other side of such a river as a boundary.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.2.8"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.8.1" href="#Kd.2.8.1"></a>
Now at that time monks recited the Pātimokkha in successive cells
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.1.107" href="#Vin.1.107"></a>
 without (making) a rendezvous. In-coming monks did not know or they thought, “Where will the Observance be carried out to-day?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>
“
<span class="rule">Monks, the Pātimokkha should not be recited in successive cells without (making) a rendezvous. Whoever should (so) recite it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to carry out the Observance having agreed upon an Observance-hall that the Order desires: a dwelling-place or a curved house or a long house or a mansion or a cave.</span> And thus, monks, should it be agreed upon:</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.8.2" href="#Kd.2.8.2"></a>
“The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. If it seems right to the Order, the Order should agree upon such and such a dwelling-place as an Observance-hall. This is the motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. The Order is agreeing upon such and such a dwelling-place as an Observance-hall. If the agreement upon such and such a dwelling-place as an Observance-hall is pleasing to the venerable ones, let them be silent; he to whom it is not pleasing should speak. Such and such a dwelling-place as an Observance-hall is agreed upon by the Order. It is pleasing to the Order, therefore it is silent; thus do I understand this</span>’.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.8.3" href="#Kd.2.8.3"></a>
Now at that time in a certain residence two Observance-halls came to be agreed upon. Monks assembled together in
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.140" href="#BD.4.140"></a>
 both thinking: “Observance will be carried out here,” “Observance will be carried out here.” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>
“
<span class="rule">Monks, two Observance-halls in one residence should not be agreed upon. Whoever should (so) agree, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, having abolished one, to carry out the Observance in one place (only).</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.8.4" href="#Kd.2.8.4"></a>
“And thus, monks, should it be abolished: The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. If it seems right to the Order, the Order may abolish such and such an Observance-hall. This is the motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. The Order is abolishing such and such an Observance-hall. If the abolition of such and such an Observance-hall is pleasing to the venerable ones, they should be silent; he to whom it is not pleasing should speak. Such and such an Observance-hall is abolished by the Order. It is pleasing to the Order, therefore it is silent; thus do I understand this</span>’.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.2.9"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.9.1" href="#Kd.2.9.1"></a>
Now at that time in a certain residence a very small Observance-hall came to be agreed upon. A large Order of monks came to be assembled together on an Observance-day. Monks, sitting on ground that had not been agreed upon, heard the Pātimokkha. Then it occurred to these monks: “It is laid down by the Lord
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.1.108" href="#Vin.1.108"></a>
 that the Observance is to be carried out having agreed upon an Observance-hall, but we heard the Pātimokkha while we were sitting on ground that was not agreed upon. Now was the Observance carried out for us or was it not carried out?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Monks, if one is sitting on the ground, whether it has been agreed upon or not agreed upon, and hears the Pātimokkha from there, the Observance is carried out for him. </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.9.2" href="#Kd.2.9.2"></a>
“Well then, monks, if an Order desires a maximum for Observance of a certain size let it agree upon a maximum for Observance of that size. And thus, monks, should it be agreed upon: First, marks should be announced. The Order, having announced the marks, should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. In as much as marks all round are announced, if it seems right to the Order the Order may agree upon a maximum for Observance in accordance with these marks. This is the motion.

If the agreement upon a maximum for Observance in accordance with these marks is pleasing to the venerable ones, they should be silent; he to whom it is not pleasing should speak. The maximum for Observance is agreed upon by the Order in accordance with these marks. It is pleasing to the Order, therefore it is silent; thus do I understand this</span>’.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.2.10"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.10.1" href="#Kd.2.10.1"></a>
Now at that time in a certain residence newly ordained monks, being the first to have assembled together on an Observance day, saying: “The elders are not coming yet,” went away. The Observance was not at a right time. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>
“<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, on an Observance day monks who are elders to assemble together first.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.2.11"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.11.1" href="#Kd.2.11.1"></a>
Now at that time in Rājagaha several residences came to have the same boundary. Monks quarrelled about this, saying: “Let the Observance be carried out in our residence,” “Let the Observance be carried out in our residence.” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>

“This is a case, monks, where several residences come to
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.142" href="#BD.4.142"></a>
have the same boundary. Monks quarrel about this, saying: ‘Let the Observance be carried out in our residence’, ‘Let the Observance be carried out in our residence’. Monks those monks, one and all, having assembled together in one place, should carry out the Observance, or, having assembled together they should carry out the Observance there where a monk who is an elder is staying.
<span class="rule">But the Observance should not be carried out by an incomplete Order. Whoever should (so) carry it out, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”

Now at one time the venerable Kassapa the Great, going from Andhakavinda to Rājagaha for Observance and crossing a river on the way, was nearly carried away, and his robes got wet. Monks spoke thus to the venerable Kassapa the Great: “Why are your robes wet, your reverence?”</p>
<p>“Now I, your reverences, coming from Andhakavinda to Rājagaha for the Observance and crossing a river on the way, was nearly carried away. Because of this my robes are wet.” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Whatever boundary, monks, is agreed upon by an Order for the same communion, for one Observance, let the Order agree (to regard) that boundary (as a place where a monk is) not away, separated from the three robes.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.12.2" href="#Kd.2.12.2"></a>
“And thus, monks, should it be agreed upon: The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. Whatever boundary was agreed upon by the Order for the same communion, for one Observance, if it seems right to the Order <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.143" href="#BD.4.143"></a>
 the Order may agree (to regard) that boundary (as a place where a monk is) not away, separated from the three robes. This is the motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. Whatever boundary was agreed upon by the Order for the same communion, for one Observance the Order is agreeing (to regard) that boundary (as a place where a monk is) not away, separated from the three robes. If the agreement (to regard) this boundary (as a place where a monk is) not away, separated from the three robes is pleasing to the venerable ones, they should be silent; he to whom it is not pleasing should speak. This boundary is agreed upon the by Order (to be regarded as a place where a monk is) not away, separated from the three robes.

Now at that time monks, thinking: “An agreement (for a monk to be regarded) as not away, separated from the three robes is allowed by the Lord,” laid aside robes in a house. These robes were lost and burnt and eaten by rats. The monks became badly dressed, their robes worn thin. Monks spoke thus: “Why are you, your reverences, badly dressed, your robes worn thin?”</p>
<p>“Now we, your reverences, thinking: ‘An agreement (for a monk to be regarded) as not away, separated from the three robes is allowed by the Lord,’ laid aside robes in a house. These robes have been lost and burnt and eaten by rats. That is why we are badly dressed, our robes worn thin.” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Whatever boundary, monks, is agreed upon by an Order for the same communion, for one Observance, let the Order agree (to regard) that boundary (as a place where a monk is) not away, separated from the three robes, except it be a village and the precincts of a village.</p>

Now at that time the group of six monks combined boundary with boundary. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Monks, those for whom a boundary was agreed upon first, that (formal) act of theirs is legitimate, it is irreversible, fit to stand.

Now at that time the group of six monks placed boundary within boundary. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Monks, those for whom a boundary was agreed upon

Then it occurred to monks: “Now, how many Observance days are there?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Monks, there are these two Observance days, the fourteenth and the fifteenth. These, monks, are the two Observance days.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.14.2" href="#Kd.2.14.2"></a>
Then it occurred to monks: “Now, how many (formal) acts for Observance are there?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Monks, there are these four (formal) acts for Observance: a (formal) act for Observance (carried out) not by rule when an Order is incomplete; a (formal) act for Observance (carried out) not by rule when an Order is complete; a (formal) act for Observance (carried out) by rule when an Order is incomplete; a (formal) act for Observance (carried out) by rule when an Order is complete. Now, monks, that which is a (formal) act for Observance carried out not by rule when an Order is incomplete, such a (formal) act for Observance, monks, should not be carried out, nor is such a (formal) act for Observance allowed by me.</p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.15.1" href="#Kd.2.15.1"></a>
Then it occurred to monks: “Now, how many ways for the recital of the Pātimokkha are there?”. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Monks, there are these five (ways for the) recital of the Pātimokkha: having recited the provenance, the rest may be announced as though it had been (already) heard; this is the first (way for the) recital of the Pātimokkha. Having recited the provenance, having recited the four offences involving defeat, the rest may be announced as though it had been (already) heard; this is the second (way for the) recital of the Pātimokkha. Having recited the provenance, having recited the four offences involving defeat, having recited the thirteen offences entailing a formal meeting of the Order, the rest may be announced as though it had been (already) heard; this is the third (way for the) recital of the Pātimokkha. Having recited the provenance, having recited the four offences involving defeat, having recited the thirteen offences entailing a formal meeting of the Order, having recited the two undetermined offences, the rest may be announced as though it had been (already) heard; this is the fourth (way for the) recital of the Pātimokkha.

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.15.2" href="#Kd.2.15.2"></a>
Now, at that time, monks, thinking: “Recital of the Pātimokkha in brief is allowed by the Lord,” all the time recited the Pātimokkha in brief. They told this matter to the Lord.

Now at that time in a certain residence in the Kosala country there came to be a menace from savages on an Observance day. The monks were unable to recite the Pātimokkha in full.

Then the Lord, having stayed in Rājagaha for as long as he found suiting, set out on tour for Codanāvatthu. In due course, walking on a tour, he arrived in Codanāvatthu. Now at that time several monks were staying in a certain residence;

Then the Lord, having stayed at Codanāvatthu for as long as he found suiting, returned again to Rājagaha. Now at that time people asked the monks as they were walking for almsfood: “Which (day) of the half-month is it, honoured sirs?” The monks spoke thus: “We, sirs, do not know.” The people … spread it about, saying: “These recluses, sons of the Sakyans, do not even know the calculation of the half-months, so how can they know anything else that is good?” They told this matter to the Lord.

A monk who is an elder, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, having sat down on his haunches, having saluted with joined palms, should speak thus to these monks: ‘<span class="kamma">I, your reverences, am quite pure, understand that I am quite pure; I, your reverences, am quite pure, understand that I am quite pure; I, your reverences, am quite pure, understand that I am quite pure</span>’.</p>

Now how can the Observance be carried out by us?” They told this matter to the Lord.

Now how can the Observance be carried out by me?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>

“This is a case, monks, where one monk is staying in a certain residence on an Observance day. That monk, having swept that place to which monks return—an attendance hall or a pavilion or the root of a tree—having put out drinking water and water for washing, having made ready a seat, having made a light, should sit down.

 an offence on an Observance day. Then it occurred to this monk: “It is laid down by the Lord that the Observance should not be carried out by an offender, but I have fallen into an offence. Now what line of conduct should be followed by me?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “This is a case, monks, where a monk comes to have fallen into an offence on an Observance day.

Now at that time the whole Order in a certain residence came to have fallen into a collective offence on an Observance day. Then it occurred to these monks: “It is laid down by the Lord that a collective offence should not be confessed, that a collective offence
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.1.127" href="#Vin.1.127"></a>
 should not be acknowledged, but this whole Order has fallen into a collective offence. Now what line or conduct should be followed by us?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “This is a case, monks, where in a certain residence the whole Order comes to have fallen into a collective offence on an Observance day.

Now at that time in a certain residence the whole Order came to have fallen into a collective offence. It did not know the name or the class of that offence. A certain monk came there; he had heard much, he was one to whom the tradition had been handed down; he was an expert on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, an expert on discipline, an expert on the summaries; he was wise, experienced, clever; he was conscientious, scrupulous, desirous of training. A certain monk approached that monk; having approached, he spoke thus to him: “What kind of an offence does he fall into, your reverence, who does such and such a thing?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.27.11" href="#Kd.2.27.11"></a>
He spoke thus: “Whoever does such and such a thing,
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.170" href="#BD.4.170"></a>
 your reverence, falls into this kind of offence. This is the kind of offence that you, your reverence, have fallen into; make amends for this offence.” He spoke thus: “I, your reverence, have not fallen into this offence altogether alone; this
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.1.128" href="#Vin.1.128"></a>
 whole Order has fallen into this offence.” He spoke thus: “What has it to do with you, your reverence, whether another has fallen or has not fallen? Please do you, your reverence, remove your own offence.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.27.12" href="#Kd.2.27.12"></a>
Then that monk, having at that monk’s bidding made amends for that offence, approached those monks; having approached them, he spoke thus to those monks: “It is said, your reverences, that whoever does such and such a thing falls into this kind of offence. This is the kind of offence that you, your reverences, have fallen into; make amends for this offence.” But these monks did not want to make amends for that offence at that monk’s bidding. They told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.27.13" href="#Kd.2.27.13"></a>
“This is a case, monks, where in a certain residence the whole Order comes to have fallen into a collective offence. It does not know the name or the class of that offence.

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.27.14" href="#Kd.2.27.14"></a>
“He speaks thus: ‘Whoever does such and such a thing, your reverence, falls into this kind of offence. This is the kind of offence that you, your reverence, have fallen into; make amends for this offence’. He speaks thus: ‘I, your reverence, have not fallen into this offence altogether alone; this whole Order has fallen into this offence’.

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.27.15" href="#Kd.2.27.15"></a>
“Then if that monk, having at that monk’s bidding made amends for that offence, approaches those monks and having approached them speaks thus to those monks: ‘It is said, your reverence, that whoever does such and such a thing falls into this kind of offence. This is the kind of offence that you, your reverences, have fallen into; make amends for this offence’; and if, monks, these monks should make amends for that offence at that monk’s bidding, that is good. But if they should not make amends for it, then, monks, these monks need not be spoken to by that monk if he is not willing.” </p>
