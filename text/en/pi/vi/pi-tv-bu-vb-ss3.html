… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. At that time the
venerable Udāyin lived in the jungle. The venerable one’s dwelling was lovely,
good to look upon, beautiful. At that time many women came to the park in order
to see the dwelling. Then those women approached the venerable Udāyin, and
having approached him, they said to the venerable Udāyin:</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, we want to see the master’s dwelling.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Udāyin, showing these women his dwelling and pointing out
the privies to them, spoke in praise, spoke in blame and begged and implored
and asked and questioned and described and exhorted and abused. Those <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.128" href="#Vin.3.128"></a>
women who had little fear of blame, who were sly and who had no shame mocked at
the venerable Udāyin, called out to him, laughed at him, made fun of him. But
those women who had shame, upon departing complained to the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, this is not suitable, it is not fitting, we should not wish
this spoken about even by our husbands, to say nothing of master Udāyin.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.3.1.2" href="#Bu-Ss.3.1.2"></a>
Then those who were modest monks became annoyed, vexed and angry and said:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.215" href="#BD.1.215"></a>
“How can the venerable Udāyin offend women with lewd words?” Then these monks
told this matter to the lord. Then the lord on this occasion and in this
connection had the company of monks convened and questioned the venerable
Udāyin, saying:</p>
<p>“Is it true as is said, Udāyin, that you offended women with lewd words?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“It is not suitable, foolish man, it is not proper, it is not becoming, it is
not worthy of a recluse, it is out of place, it is not to be done. How can you,
foolish man, offend women with lewd words? Foolish man, is not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> uttered in various ways by me for the sake of passionlessness, not for the
sake of passion … proclaimed for the allaying of the flames of pleasures of the
senses? It is not, foolish man, for the benefit of unbelievers … and thus,
monks, this course of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, affected by desire, with perverted heart, should offend a woman
with lewd words concerned with unchastity, as, for example, a youth to a young
woman, it is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order.”</span></p>
