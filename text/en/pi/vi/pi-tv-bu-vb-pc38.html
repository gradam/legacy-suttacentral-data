… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the venerable Belaṭṭhasīsa, the preceptor of the venerable Ānanda, was staying
in the jungle. He, having walked for alms-food, having conveyed boiled rice to
the monastery, having had it dried, laid it aside; when he came to need it for
food, then moistening it with water, he ate it; after a long time he entered
the village for alms-food. Monks spoke thus to the venerable Belaṭṭhasīsa: “How
is it that you, your reverence, after a long time enter the village for
alms-food?” Then the venerable Belaṭṭhasīsa told this matter to the monks. They
said:</p>
<p>“But do you, your reverence, eat a meal that was stored?”</p>
<p>“Yes, your reverences.” Those who were modest monks …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Belaṭṭhasīsa, ate a meal that was stored?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, Belaṭṭhasīsa, eat a meal that was stored? It is not,
Belaṭṭhasīsa, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks,
this rule of training should be set forth: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.87" href="#Vin.4.87"></a>
</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should eat or partake of solid food <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.339" href="#BD.2.339"></a>
or soft food that was stored, there is an offence of expiation.</span>”

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.38.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.38.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… is monk to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Stored</span> means:
<span class="gloss">accepted today, it becomes eaten the next day.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Solid food</span> means:
<span class="gloss">…
<span class="term">soft food</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… meat. If he accepts it, saying, “I will eat, I will partake of,” there is an
offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful there is an offence of expiation. </span></span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.38.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.38.2.2"></a>
If he thinks that it is stored when it is stored (and) eats or partakes of
solid food or soft food, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as
to whether it is stored … If he thinks that it is not stored when it is stored
… expiation. If he accepts for the sake of nutriment food (to be eaten) during
a watch of the night, during seven days, during life, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. For every mouthful there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he
thinks that it is stored when it is not stored, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is not stored, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not stored when it is not
stored, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.38.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.38.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if, having stored (food) for the time being, he eats it in
that time; if, having stored (food to be eaten) during a watch of the night, he
eats <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.340" href="#BD.2.340"></a>
it in a watch of the night; if, having stored (food) to be eaten during seven
days, he eats it in seven days; if, when there is a reason, he uses (food to be
eaten) during life; if he is mad; if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
