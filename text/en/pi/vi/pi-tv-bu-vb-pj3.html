<h1>Monks’ Expulsion (<i lang="pi">Pārājika</i>) 3</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<h3>First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.3.1"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.3.1.1" href="#Bu-Pj.3.1.1"></a>
<a class="ms-pa" id="MS.376" href="#MS.376"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.116" href="#BD.1.116"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.68" href="#Vin.3.68"></a>
At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Vesālī in the hall with the
peaked roof in the Great Wood. At that time the Master talked in many ways to
the monks on the subject of unattractiveness, he spoke in praise of
unattractiveness, he spoke in praise of developing (the perception of)
unattractiveness, he spoke thus and thus he spoke in many ways in praise of the
attainment of unattractiveness. <a class="ms-pa" id="MS.377" href="#MS.377"></a>
Then the Master addressed the monks:</p>
<p>“Monks, I wish to go into solitary retreat for half a month. No one is to
approach me except the one who brings me almsfood.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master,” the monks replied, and accordingly no one approached the Master
except the one to take him almsfood.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.378" href="#MS.378"></a>
Then the monks thought, “The Master has talked in many ways on the subject of
unattractiveness,” and they dwelt intent upon the practice of developing (the
perception of) unattractiveness in its many different aspects. As a consequence
they became troubled by their own bodies, ashamed of them, loathing them. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.117" href="#BD.1.117"></a>
Just as a young woman or man, fond of adornments and with head washed, would be
ashamed, humiliated and disgusted if the carcase of a snake, a dog or a man
were hung around their neck, just so those monks were troubled by their own
bodies, ashamed of them and loathed them. They took their own lives, took the
lives of one another, and they approached Migalaṇḍika, a sham recluse, the
recluse lookalike, and said, “Friend, please kill us. This bowl and robe will
be yours.” Then Migalaṇḍika, hired for a bowl and robe, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.118" href="#BD.1.118"></a>
killed a number of monks.</p>
<p>He then took his
<span class="pts">blood-stained</span> knife to the river Vaggumudā,
<a class="ms-pa" id="MS.379" href="#MS.379"></a>
and while he was washing it he became anxious and remorseful: “Indeed, it’s a
loss for me, it’s no gain; indeed, it’s badly gained by me, not <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.69" href="#Vin.3.69"></a>
well-gained. I have made much demerit because I have killed monks who were
virtuous and of good conduct.”</p>
<p>Then a certain god of Māra’s retinue, walking across the water, said to
Migalaṇḍika, “Well done, superior man; it is a gain for you, it is well-gained.
You have made much merit, because you bring those across who have not yet
crossed.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.119" href="#BD.1.119"></a>
<a class="ms-pa" id="MS.380" href="#MS.380"></a>
Then Migalaṇḍika thought, “So it seems it is a gain for me, that it is
well-gained by me, and that I have made much merit by bringing those across who
have not yet crossed.” He then went from dwelling to dwelling, from dormitory
to dormitory, and said, “Who has not yet crossed? Whom do I bring across?” And
those monks who were not free from desire became fearful and terrified, with
their hair standing on end, but not so those who were free from desire. <a class="ms-pa" id="MS.381" href="#MS.381"></a>
Then Migalaṇḍika killed a monk, on a single day he killed two monks, on a
single day … three … four … five … ten … twenty … thirty … forty … fifty … on a
single day he killed sixty monks.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.3.1.2" href="#Bu-Pj.3.1.2"></a>
<a class="ms-pa" id="MS.382" href="#MS.382"></a>
At the end of that half-month, the Master arose from seclusion and addressed
Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, why is the Sangha of monks so diminished?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.120" href="#BD.1.120"></a>
“It is because the Master talked to the monks in many ways on the subject of
unattractiveness—he spoke in praise of unattractiveness, in praise of
developing (the perception of) unattractiveness, and in many ways in praise of
the attainment of unattractiveness. And, Master, those monks thought, ‘The
Master has talked in many ways on the subject of unattractiveness,’ and so they
dwelt intent upon the practice of developing (the perception of)
unattractiveness in its many different aspects. As a consequence they became
troubled by their own bodies, ashamed of them, loathing them. Just as a young
woman or man, fond of adornments and with head washed, would be ashamed,
humiliated and disgusted if the carcase of a snake, a dog or a man were hung
around their neck, just so these monks were troubled by their own bodies, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.70" href="#Vin.3.70"></a>
ashamed of them, loathing them. They then took their own lives, took the lives
of each other, and they approached Migalaṇḍika, the recluse lookalike, and
said, ‘Friend, please kill us. This bowl and robe will be yours.’ Then, Master,
hired for a bowl and robe, Migalaṇḍika killed a monk … on a single day he
killed sixty monks. Master, please give another instruction for the Sangha of
monks to be established in final knowledge.”</p>
<p>“Well then, Ānanda, call together in the assembly-hall all the monks that dwell
near Vesālī.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.121" href="#BD.1.121"></a>
“Yes, Master,” he said. And when he had done so, he approached the Master and
said, “Master, the Sangha of monks is assembled. Master, please do what you
think is appropriate.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.383" href="#MS.383"></a>
Then the Master went to the assembly-hall, sat down on the prepared seat, and
said:</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.3.1.3" href="#Bu-Pj.3.1.3"></a>
<a class="ms-pa" id="MS.384" href="#MS.384"></a>
“Monks, the <i lang="pi">samādhi</i> by mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated, is peaceful and
sublime, an exalted state of happiness, and it stops and settles bad,
unwholesome qualities on the spot, whenever they arise. Just as a big storm,
when it arises out of season in the last month of the hot weather, stops and
settles the dust and dirt in the atmosphere—even so the <i lang="pi">samādhi</i> by mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated, is peaceful and
sublime, an exalted state of happiness, and it stops and settles bad,
unwholesome qualities on the spot, whenever they arise. <a class="ms-pa" id="MS.385" href="#MS.385"></a>
And how is the <i lang="pi">samādhi</i> by mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated in this way?</p>
<p><span class="sutta">As to that, monks, a monk sits down in the wilderness, at
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.122" href="#BD.1.122"></a>
the foot of a tree, or in an empty hut; he crosses his legs, straightens his
body, and establishes mindfulness in front of him. Simply mindful, he breathes
in; simply mindful, he breathes out. <a class="ms-pa" id="MS.386" href="#MS.386"></a>
When he breathes in long, he knows it; and when he breathes out long, he knows
that. When he breathes in short, he knows it; and when he breathes out short,
he knows that. While breathing in, he trains in having the full experience (of
the breath); <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.71" href="#Vin.3.71"></a>
while breathing out, he trains in having the full experience (of the breath).
While breathing in, he trains in calming the activity of the body; while
breathing out, he trains in calming the activity of the body. <a class="ms-pa" id="MS.387" href="#MS.387"></a>
While breathing in, he trains in experiencing rapture; while breathing out, he
trains in experiencing rapture. While breathing in, he trains in experiencing
happiness; while breathing out, he trains in experiencing happiness. While
breathing in, he trains in experiencing the activity of the mind; while
breathing out, he trains in experiencing the activity of the mind. While
breathing in, he trains in calming the activity of the mind; while breathing
out, he trains in calming the activity of the mind. While breathing in, he
trains in experiencing the mind; while breathing out, he trains in experiencing
the mind. While breathing in, he trains in gladdening the mind; while breathing
out, he trains in gladdening the mind. While breathing in, he trains in
unifying the mind; while breathing out, he trains in unifying the mind. While
breathing in, he trains in freeing the mind; while breathing out, he trains in
freeing the mind. <a class="ms-pa" id="MS.388" href="#MS.388"></a>
While breathing in, he trains in contemplating impermanence; while breathing
out, he trains in contemplating impermanence. While breathing in, he trains in
contemplating fading away; while breathing out, he trains in contemplating
fading away. While breathing in, he trains in contemplating cessation; while
breathing out, he trains in contemplating cessation. While breathing in, he
trains in contemplating relinquishment; while breathing out, he trains in
contemplating relinquishment.</span></p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.389" href="#MS.389"></a>
Monks, when the <i lang="pi">samādhi</i> by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated in this way, it is
peaceful and sublime, an exalted state of happiness, and it stops and settles
bad, unwholesome qualities on the spot, whenever they arise.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.3.1.4" href="#Bu-Pj.3.1.4"></a>
<a class="ms-pa" id="MS.390" href="#MS.390"></a>
And in this connection the Master
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.123" href="#BD.1.123"></a>
convened the Sangha of monks and questoned the monks:</p>
<p>“Monks, is it true that some monks have taken their own lives, have killed one
another, and have said to Migalaṇḍika, ‘Friend, please kill us. This bowl and
robe will be yours’?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked them: “Monks, it is not suitable for these
monks, it is not becoming, it is not proper, it is not worthy of a recluse, it
is not allowable, it should not be done. How could those monks take their own
lives … and say … ‘… This bowl and robe will be yours’? It will not give rise
to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be
recited thus:</p>
<h3>Preliminary ruling</h3>
<p class="subrule"><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.391" href="#MS.391"></a>
If a monk intentionally kills a human being or searches for someone to kill
him, he too is expelled and not in communion.”</p>
<p class="end"><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.392" href="#MS.392"></a>
Thus the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3>Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.3.2" href="#Bu-Pj.3.2"></a>
<a class="ms-pa" id="MS.393" href="#MS.393"></a>
At one time a certain lay-follower was ill. His wife was beautiful and
pleasant, and the group of six monks had fallen in love with her. Then those
monks said to each other: “Friends, if this <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.72" href="#Vin.3.72"></a>
lay-follower lives, we won’t get this woman. Come, let us praise the beauty of
death to him.” So they went to that lay follower and said:</p>
<p>“Friend, you have done what is good and wholesome; you have made a <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.124" href="#BD.1.124"></a>
shelter from fear. You have not done anything bad; you have not been greedy and
immoral. What need have you of this wretched, difficult life? Death is better
for you than life. When you have passed away, at the breaking up of the body
after death, you will be reborn in a happy destination, in a heaven world.
There you will amuse yourself and enjoy the five types of heavenly sensual
pleasures.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.394" href="#MS.394"></a>
Then that lay-follower thought, “The Masters have spoken the truth, for I have
done what is good and avoided what is bad, and after death I will be reborn in
a happy destination.”</p>
<p>He ate various types of detrimental food, he drank detrimental drinks, and
because of this he became seriously ill and died.</p>
<p>His wife criticised and denounced them: “These <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.125" href="#BD.1.125"></a>
recluses, the sons of the Sakyan, are shameless, immoral, liars. They claim to
be followers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, of just conduct, committed to the spiritual life, speakers of truth,
virtuous, of good conduct. But there is no recluseship or brahminhood among
these—it is lost to them. Where is recluseship and brahminhood among them? They
have departed from it. They praised the beauty of death to my husband. Because
of them my husband has died.”</p>
<p>And other people criticised and denounced them: “These recluses … Because of
them that lay-follower has died.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.395" href="#MS.395"></a>
Monks heard the criticism of those people. Those monks who had few desires and
a sense of shame, who were contented, scrupulous, and desirous of training,
criticised and denounced the group of six monks: “How could they praise the
beauty of death to that lay-follower?” <a class="ms-pa" id="MS.396" href="#MS.396"></a>
Then
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.73" href="#Vin.3.73"></a>
those monks informed the Master …</p>
<p>“Is it true, monks, that you praised the beauty of death to that lay-follower?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked them: “Foolish men, it is not suitable, it is
not becoming, it is not proper, it is not worthy of a recluse, it is not
allowable, it should not be done. How could you praise the beauty of death to
that lay-follower? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it …
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.397" href="#MS.397"></a>
“If a monk intentionally kills a human being or searches for someone to kill
him or praises death or <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.126" href="#BD.1.126"></a>
incites someone to die, saying, ‘Good man, what use to you is this wretched,
difficult life? Death is better for you than life.’ If, thinking and intending
thus, he praises death in various ways or incites someone to die, he too is
expelled and not in communion.”</p>

<h5>By a messenger</h5>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.419" href="#MS.419"></a>
If a monk tells a second monk, “Kill so-and-so,” there is an offence of bad
conduct. If the second monk kills that person, thinking he is the one he was
told to kill, there is an offence entailing expulsion for both.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.420" href="#MS.420"></a>
If a monk tells a second monk, “kill so-and-so,” there is an offence of bad
conduct. If the second monk kills someone else, thinking he is the one he was
told to kill, there is no offence for the instigator, but there is an offence
entailing expulsion for the murderer.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.421" href="#MS.421"></a>
If a monk tells a second monk … If the second monk kills that person, thinking

<p><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.423" href="#MS.423"></a>
If a monk tells a second monk, “tell so-and-so to tell so-and-so to kill
so-and-so,” there is an offence of bad conduct. In informing the next person,
there is an offence of bad conduct. If the (potential) murderer accepts, there
is a serious offence for the instigator. If he kills that person, there is an
offence entailing expulsion for all of them.</p>
<h5>By a messenger who does not follow instructions</h5>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.424" href="#MS.424"></a>
If a monk tells a second monk, “tell so-and-so to tell so-and-so to kill
so-and-so,” there is an offence of bad conduct. If the second monk tells
someone else than the one he was told to tell, there is an offence of bad
conduct. If the (potential) murderer accepts, there is an offence of bad
conduct. If he kills that person, there is no offence for the instigator, but
there is an offence entailing expulsion for the conveyor of the message and for
the murderer.</p>
<h5>By a messenger gone and returned again</h5>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.425" href="#MS.425"></a>
If a monk tells a second monk, “kill so-and-so,” there is an offence of bad
conduct. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.1.130" href="#BD.1.130"></a>
He goes, but returns, saying, “I was not able to kill him.” If the first monk
tells him again, “when you are able, then kill him,” there is an offence of bad

<p><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.426" href="#MS.426"></a>
If a monk tells a second monk, “kill so-and-so,” there is an offence of bad
conduct. He then becomes remorseful, but does not say, “do not kill him.” If
the second monk then kills that person, there is an offence entailing expulsion
for both.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="MS.427" href="#MS.427"></a>
If a monk tells a second monk, “kill so-and-so,” there is an offence of bad
conduct. He then becomes remorseful and says, “do not kill him.” If the second
monk replies, “I have been told by you to do so,” and then kills that person,
