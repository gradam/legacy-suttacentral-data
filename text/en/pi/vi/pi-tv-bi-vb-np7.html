… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
lay-followers, having made a voluntary collection for robe-material for the
Order of nuns, having laid aside what was necessary in a certain cloak-seller’s
house, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.252" href="#Vin.4.252"></a>
having approached the nuns, spoke thus: “Ladies, in such and such a
cloak-seller’s house what is necessary for robe-material is laid aside. Having
had the robe-material brought from there, distribute it.”</p>
<p>And the nuns, although having themselves asked for what was necessary, yet
having got medicine in exchange, made use of it. The lay-followers, having
found out … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns get something in
exchange for what was necessary (and) appointed for another thing, destined for
another thing, belonging to an Order, (and) that they themselves asked for?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns got something in exchange … that they
themselves asked for?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns get something in exchange … that they themselves asked
for? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule
of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should get something in exchange for what was necessary (and)
appointed for another thing, destined for another thing, belonging to an <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.232" href="#BD.3.232"></a>
Order, (and) that she herself asked for, there is an offence of expiation
involving forfeiture.”</span></p>
