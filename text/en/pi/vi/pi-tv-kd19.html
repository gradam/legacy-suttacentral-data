At one time the Awakened One, the Lord was staying at Sāvatthī in the Eastern
Monastery in the long house of Migāra’s mother. Now at that time the Lord was
sitting down surrounded by an Order of monks on an Observance day. Then, when
the night was far spent, as the first watch was waning, the venerable Ānanda,
rising from his seat, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, having
saluted the Lord with joined palms, spoke thus to the Lord:</p>
<p>“Lord, the night is far spent, the first watch is waning; the Order of monks
has been sitting down for a long time; Lord, let the Lord recite the Pātimokkha
to the monks.” When he had spoken thus the Lord became silent. And when the
night was far spent, as the middle watch was waning, the venerable Ānanda a
second time rising from his seat, having arranged … spoke thus to the Lord:</p>
<p>“Lord, the night is far spent, the middle watch is waning; … recite the
Pātimokkha to the monks.” And a second time the Lord became silent. And when
the night was far spent, as the last watch was waning, when the sun had risen
and the night had a face of gladness, a third time did the venerable Ānanda,
rising from his seat, having arranged … speak thus to the Lord:</p>
<p>“Lord, the night is far spent, the last watch is waning; the sun has risen, the
night has a face of gladness; the Order of monks has been sitting down for a
long time; Lord, let the Lord recite the Pātimokkha to the monks.”</p>
<p>“Ānanda, the assembly is not entirely pure.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.19.1.2" href="#Kd.19.1.2"></a>
Then it occurred to the venerable Moggallāna the Great:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.331" href="#BD.5.331"></a>
“Now, on account of which individual did the Lord speak thus: ‘Ānanda, the
assembly is not entirely pure’?” Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great with
his mind compassed the minds of the entire Order of monks. Then the venerable
Moggallāna the Great saw that individual sitting in the midst of the Order of
monks—of bad moral habit, depraved in character, of impure and suspicious
behaviour, of concealed actions, not a (true) recluse (although) pretending to
be a (true) recluse, not a farer of the Brahma-faring (although) pretending to
be a farer of the Brahma-faring, rotten within, filled with desire, filthy by
nature; seeing him, he approached that individual, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.237" href="#Vin.2.237"></a>
having approached, he spoke thus to that individual:</p>
<p>“Get up, your reverence, the Lord has seen you; for you there is no communion
together with the monks.” When he had spoken thus that individual became
silent. And a second time … And a third time the venerable Moggallāna the Great
spoke thus to that individual: “Get up, your reverence … for you there is no
communion together with the monks.” And a third time that individual became
silent. Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great, having taken that individual
by the arm, having thrust him out through the porch of the gateway, having shot
the bolt, approached the Lord; having approached, he spoke thus to the Lord:</p>
<p>“Lord I have thrust that individual out; the company is entirely pure; Lord,
let the Lord recite the Pātimokkha to the monks.”</p>
<p>“How strange, Moggallāna, how wonderful, Moggallāna, that that foolish man
should have waited even until he was taken hold of by the arm.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.19.1.3" href="#Kd.19.1.3"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<h2>Eight wonderful things about the great ocean</h2>
“Monks,
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.332" href="#BD.5.332"></a>
there are these eight strange and wonderful things about the great ocean, from
constantly having seen which <i lang="pi">asuras</i> delight in the great ocean. What are the eight? The great ocean, monks,
deepens gradually, slopes gradually, shelves gradually, with no abruptness like
a precipice. And monks, that the great ocean deepens gradually, slopes
gradually, shelves gradually with no abruptness like a precipice—this, monks,
is the first strange and wonderful thing about the great ocean from constantly
having seen which <i lang="pi">asuras</i> delight in the great ocean.
<p>“And again, monks, the great ocean is stable, it does not overflow its margins.
And, monks, that the great ocean is stable, that it does not overflow its
margins—this, monks, is the second strange and wonderful thing …</p>
<p>“And again, monks, the great ocean does not associate with a dead body, a
corpse. Whatever dead body, corpse there may be in the great ocean, that it
just quickly forces ashore and pushes on to the dry land. That the great ocean,
monks, does not associate with a dead body, a corpse … this, monks, is the
third strange and wonderful thing …</p>
<p>“And again, monks, all the great rivers, that is to say the Ganges, the Jumna,
the Aciravatī, the Sarabhū, the Mahī—these, on reaching the great ocean lose
their former names and identities and are reckoned simply as the great ocean.
That all the great rivers … this, monks, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.238" href="#Vin.2.238"></a>
is the fourth strange and wonderful thing …</p>
<p>“And again, monks, those streams which in the world flow into the great ocean,
and those showers from the sky which fall into it, yet is neither the emptiness
nor the fullness of the great ocean affected by that. That those streams which
in the world … this, monks, is the fifth strange and wonderful thing …</p>
<p>“And again, monks, the great ocean has one taste, the taste <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.333" href="#BD.5.333"></a>
of salt. That the great ocean, monks, has one taste … this, monks, is the sixth
strange and wonderful thing …</p>
<p>“And again, monks, the great ocean has many treasures, divers treasures; these
treasures are there, that is to say: pearl, crystal, lapis lazuli, shell,
quartz, coral, silver, gold, ruby, cat’s-eye. That the great ocean, monks, has
many treasures … this, monks, is the seventh strange and wonderful thing …</p>
<p>“And again, monks, the great ocean is the abode of great beings; these beings
are there: the <i lang="pi">timis</i>, the <i lang="pi">timiṅgalas</i>, the <i lang="pi">timitimiṅgalas</i>, <i lang="pi">asuras</i>, <i lang="pi">nāgas</i>, <i lang="pi">gandhabbas</i>. There are in the great ocean individualities a hundred <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> (long), individualities two hundred … three hundred … four hundred … five
hundred <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> (long). That the great ocean, monks, is the abode of great beings; that these
beings are there: the <i lang="pi">timis</i> … individualities five hundred <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> (long)—this, monks, is the eighth strange and wonderful thing about the great
ocean from constantly having seen which asuras delight in the great ocean.
These, monks, are the eight strange and wonderful things about the great ocean
from constantly having seen which <i lang="pi">asuras</i> delight in the great ocean.</p>
<h2>Eight wonderful things about this Dhamma and Vinaya</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.19.1.4" href="#Kd.19.1.4"></a>
“In exactly the same way, monks, in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline there are eight strange and wonderful things from constantly
having seen which monks delight in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline. What are the eight?</p>
<p>“Even, monks, as the great ocean deepens gradually, slopes gradually, shelves
gradually with no abruptness like a precipice, even so, monks, in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline there is a gradual training, a gradual doing, a gradual course,
with no <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.334" href="#BD.5.334"></a>
abruptness such as penetration of profound knowledge. And, monks, that in this
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline there is a … gradual course with no abruptness such as
penetration of profound knowledge, this, monks, is the first strange and
wonderful thing from constantly having seen which monks delight in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline.</p>
<p>“And even, monks, as the great ocean is stable and does not overflow its
margins, even so, monks, whatever rule of training has been laid down by me for
disciples, my disciples will not transgress it even for life’s sake. And that,
monks, my disciples will not transgress even for life’s sake a rule of training
laid down by me for disciples, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.239" href="#Vin.2.239"></a>
this, monks, is the second strange and wonderful thing …</p>
<p>“And even, monks, as the great ocean does not associate with a dead body, a
corpse, but whatever dead body, corpse there may be in the great ocean, that it
just quickly forces ashore and pushes on to the dry land, even so, monks,
whatever individual is of bad moral habit, of depraved character, of impure and
suspicious behaviour, of concealed actions, not a (true) recluse (although)
pretending to be a (true) recluse, not a farer of the Brahma-faring (although)
pretending to be a farer of the Brahma-faring, rotten within, filled with
desire, filthy by nature—the Order does not live in communion with him, but
having assembled quickly, suspends him; and although he is sitting in the midst
of an Order of monks, yet he is far from the Order and the Order is far from
him … this, monks, is the third strange and wonderful thing …</p>
<p>“And even, monks, as those great rivers, that is to say the Ganges, the Jumna,
the Aciravatī, the Sarabhū, the Mahī which, on reaching the great ocean, lose
their former names and identities and are reckoned simply as the great ocean,
even so, monks, (members of) these four castes: noble, brahmin, merchant and
low, having gone forth from home into homelessness in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder, lose their former names and
clans and are reckoned simply as recluses, sons of the Sakyans … this, monks,
is the fourth strange and wonderful thing …</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.335" href="#BD.5.335"></a>
“And even, monks, as those streams which in the world flow into the great ocean
and those showers which fall into it from the sky, yet not by that is either
the emptiness or the fullness of the great ocean affected—even so, monks, even
if many monks attain <i lang="pi">nibbāna</i> in the <i lang="pi">nibbāna</i>-condition in which no more groups are remaining, not by that is either the
emptiness or the fullness of the <i lang="pi">nibbāna</i>-condition affected … this, monks, is the fifth strange and wonderful thing …</p>
<p>“And even, monks, as the great ocean has one taste, the taste of salt, even so,
monks, does this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline have one taste, the taste of freedom … this, monks, is the
sixth strange and wonderful thing …</p>
<p>“And even, monks, as the great ocean has many treasures, divers treasures—these
treasures are there, that is to say: pearl, crystal, lapis lazuli, shell,
quartz, coral, silver, gold, ruby, cat’s-eye—even <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.240" href="#Vin.2.240"></a>
so, monks, does this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline have many treasures, divers treasures—these treasures are
there, that is to say: the four arousings of mindfulness, the four right
efforts, the four bases of pyschic power, the five faculties, the seven links
in awakening, the noble eightfold Way … this, monks, is the seventh strange and
wonderful thing …</p>
<p>“And even, monks, as the great ocean is the abode of great beings—these beings
are there: <i lang="pi">timis</i>, <i lang="pi">timingalas</i>, <i lang="pi">timitimingalas</i>, <i lang="pi">asuras</i>, <i lang="pi">nāgas</i>, <i lang="pi">gandhabbas</i>, individualities a hundred <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> (long) … two hundred … three hundred … four hundred … five hundred <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> (long)—even so, monks, this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline is the abode of great beings—these beings are there: the
stream-attainer, the one going along to the realisation of the fruit of
stream-attainment, the once-returner, the one going along to the realisation of
the fruit of once-returning, the non-returner, the one going along to the
realisation of the fruit of non-returning, the perfected one, the one going
along to perfection. And that, monks, this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline is the abode of great beings—these
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.336" href="#BD.5.336"></a>
beings are there: the stream-attainer … the one going along to perfection,
this, monks, is the eighth strange and wonderful thing in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline from constantly having seen which monks delight in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline. These, monks, are the eight strange and wonderful things in
this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline from constantly having seen which monks delight in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline.”</p>
<p>Then the Lord, having known this matter, at that time uttered this utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“It rains hard on a covered thing,<br>
It rains not hard on an open thing;<br>
So open up the covered thing,<br>
Thus will it not rain hard on that.”</p>

<h2>Those deserving to hear the Pātimokkha</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.19.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.19.2.1" href="#Kd.19.2.1"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: “Now, I, monks, henceforth will not
carry out the Observance, I will not recite the Pātimokkha; now you yourselves,
monks, must henceforth carry out the Observance, must recite the Pātimokkha. It
is not possible, monks, it cannot come to pass that the Truth-finder should
carry out the Observance, should recite the Pātimokkha with an assembly that is
not entirely pure. Nor, monks, should the Pātimokkha be heard by one who has an
offence. Whoever (such) should hear it, there is an offence of wrong-doing. I
allow you, monks, to suspend the Pātimokkha for him who, having an offence,
hears the Pātimokkha. And thus, monks, should it be suspended: On an Observance
day, whether it be the fourteenth or the fifteenth, when that individual is
present <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.241" href="#Vin.2.241"></a>
this should be uttered in the midst of the Order: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. The individual So-and-so has an
offence; I am suspending the Pātimokkha for him, the Pātimokkha should not be
recited when he is present</span>’—(thus) does the Pātimokkha become suspended.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.19.3"></a>

<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.337" href="#BD.5.337"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks, thinking: “No one knows about us,”
listened to the Pātimokkha although they had offences. Monks who were elders,
knowing the minds of others, told the monks: “So-and-so and So-and-so, your
reverences, (belonging to) the group of six monks, thinking, ‘No one knows
about us,’ listened to the Pātimokkha although they had offences.” The group of
six monks heard it said that the monks who were elders, knowing the minds of
others, had told the monks: “So-and-so and So-and-so … listened to the
Pātimokkha although they had offences.” These, thinking: “In case the well
behaved monks suspend the Pātimokkha for us,” suspended first, without ground,
without reason, the Pātimokkha for the pure monks who had no offences. These
who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six
monks suspend, without ground, without reason, the Pātimokkha for pure monks
who have no offences?” Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:
“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six monks suspended, without
ground, without reason, the Pātimokkha for pure monks who have no offences?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he
addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, you should not, without ground, without reason, suspend the Pātimokkha
for pure monks who have no offences. Whoever should (so) suspend it, there is
an offence of wrong-doing.</span></p>

or … human beings or … non-human beings or … beasts of prey or … creeping
things or because of danger to life or because of danger to the
Brahma-faring—monks, that monk, if he so desires, may either in that residence
or in another residence, utter in the midst of the Order in the presence of
that individual: ‘Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. The talk on the
individual So-and-so’s offence involving defeat was still going forward; that
matter is not decided. If it seems right to the Order, the Order may decide
this matter.’ <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.343" href="#BD.5.343"></a>
If he succeeds thus, that is good. If he does not succeed, he should, on an
Observance day, whether the fourteenth or the fifteenth, utter in the midst of
the Order and in the presence of that individual: ‘Honoured sirs, let the Order
listen to me. The talk on the individual So-and-so’s offence involving defeat
was still going forward; that matter is not decided. I am suspending the
Pātimokkha for him, the Pātimokkha should not be recited in his presence.’ This
suspension of the Pātimokkha is legally valid.</p>

<h2>Factors for undertaking on one’s own behalf</h2>
<p><a class="cr  broken" href="#Kd.19.4">Kd.19.4</a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.344" href="#BD.5.344"></a>
Then the venerable Upāli approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted
the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a
respectful distance, the venerable Upāli spoke thus to the Lord:</p>
<p>“Lord, if a monk wishes to undertake an undertaking on his own behalf, endowed
with how many qualities is the undertaking that he may undertake on his own
behalf?”</p>
<p>“Upāli, if a monk wishes to undertake an undertaking on his own behalf, the
undertaking that he may undertake on his own behalf is endowed with five
qualities. Upāli, if a monk wishes to undertake an undertaking on his own
behalf, he should consider this: ‘That undertaking which I wish to undertake on
my own behalf, is it the right time to undertake this undertaking on my own
behalf, or not?’ If, Upāli, while that monk is considering, he knows thus: ‘It
is a wrong time to undertake this undertaking on my own behalf, not a right
time,’ Upāli, that undertaking on his own behalf should not be undertaken. But
if, Upāli, while that monk is considering, he knows thus: ‘It is a right time
to undertake this undertaking on my own behalf, not a wrong time,’ Upāli, it
should be further considered by that monk: ‘That undertaking which I wish to
undertake on my own behalf, is this undertaking on my own behalf about a true
thing, or not?’ If, Upāli, while that monk is considering, he knows thus: ‘That
under-taking on my own behalf is about an untrue thing, not a true thing,’
Upāli, that undertaking on his own behalf should not be undertaken. But if,
Upāli, while that monk is considering he knows thus: ‘That undertaking on my
own behalf is about a true thing, not an untrue thing,’ Upāli, it should be
further considered by that monk: ‘That undertaking which I wish to undertake on
my own behalf, is that undertaking connected with the goal, or not?’ If, Upāli,
while that monk is considering, he knows thus: ‘This undertaking on my own
behalf is unconnected with the goal, not connected with it,’ Upāli, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.345" href="#BD.5.345"></a>
that undertaking on his own behalf should not be undertaken. But if, Upāli,
while that monk is considering, he knows thus: ‘This undertaking on my own
behalf is connected with the goal, not unconnected with it.’ Upāli, it should
be further considered by that monk: ‘Will I, undertaking this undertaking on my
own behalf, attract monks who are comrades and associates to my side in
accordance with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, in accordance with discipline, or not?’ If, Upāli, while that monk is
considering, he knows thus: ‘I, undertaking this undertaking on my own behalf,
will not attract monks who are comrades and associates to my side in accordance
with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, in accordance with discipline,’ Upāli, that undertaking on his own behalf
should not be undertaken. But, if, Upāli, while that monk is considering, he
knows thus: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.248" href="#Vin.2.248"></a>
‘I, undertaking this undertaking on my own behalf, will attract monks who are
comrades and associates to my side in accordance with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, in accordance with discipline,’ Upāli, it should be further considered by
that monk: ‘From my having undertaken this undertaking on my own behalf, will
there be for the Order from that source strife, quarrel, dispute, contention,
schism in the Order, dissension in the Order, altercation in the Order,
differences in the Order, or not?’ If, Upāli, while this monk is considering,
he knows thus: ‘From my having undertaken this undertaking on my own behalf,
there will be for the Order from that source strife … differences in the
Order,’ Upāli, that undertaking should not be undertaken on his own behalf. But
if, Upāli, while that monk is considering, he knows thus: ‘From my having
undertaken this undertaking on my own behalf, there will not be for the Order
from that source strife … differences in the Order,’ Upāli, that undertaking on
his own behalf may be undertaken. Thus, Upāli, if an undertaking on one’s own
behalf is undertaken when it is endowed with these five qualities, later it
will be no cause for remorse.”</p>
<h2>Things to be reviewed by a reprover</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.19.5"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.19.5.1" href="#Kd.19.5.1"></a>
“Lord, if a monk is reproving, willing to reprove another, when he has
considered how many states within himself may he reprove the other?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.346" href="#BD.5.346"></a>
“Upāli, if a monk is reproving, willing to reprove another, when he has
considered five states within himself may he reprove the other. Upāli, when a
monk is reproving, willing to reprove another, he should consider thus: ‘Now,
am I quite pure in bodily conduct, am I possessed of pure bodily conduct,
flawless, faultless? Is this state found in me, or not? ‘If, Upāli, this monk
is not quite pure in bodily conduct, is not possessed of bodily conduct that is
quite pure, flawless, faultless, there will be those who will say to him:
‘Please do you, venerable one, train yourself as to body’—thus will those say
to him.</p>
<p>“And again, Upāli, if a monk is reproving, willing to reprove another, he
should consider thus: ‘Now, am I quite pure in the conduct of speech, am I
possessed of conduct in speech that is quite pure, flawless, faultless? Is this
state found in me, or not?’ If, Upāli, that monk is not quite pure in the
conduct of speech … ‘Please do you, venerable one, train yourself as to
speech’—thus will those say to him.</p>
<p>“And again, Upāli, if a monk is reproving, willing to reprove another, he
should consider thus: ‘Now is a mind of loving-kindness, without malice towards
my fellow Brahma-farers, established in me? <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.249" href="#Vin.2.249"></a>
Is this state found in me, or not?’ If, Upāli, a mind of loving-kindness,
without malice towards his fellow Brahma-farers, is not established in the
monk, there will be those who will say to him: ‘Please do you, venerable one,
establish a mind of loving-kindness towards your fellow Brahma-farers’—thus
those will say to him.</p>
<p>“And again, Upāli, if a monk is reproving, willing to reprove another, he
should consider thus: ‘Now, am I one who has heard much, an expert in the
heard, a storehouse of the heard? Those things which are lovely at the
beginning, lovely in the middle, lovely at the ending, and which, with the
spirit, with the letter, declare the Brahma-faring utterly fulfilled, wholly
purified—are such things much heard by me, learnt by heart, repeated out loud,
pondered upon, carefully attended to, well penetrated by vision? Now, is this
state found in me, or not?’ If, Upāli, the monk has not heard much … if such <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.347" href="#BD.5.347"></a>
things have not been … well penetrated by vision, there will be those who will
say to him: ‘Please do you, venerable one, master the tradition’—there will be
those who speak thus to him.</p>
<p>“And again, Upāli, if a monk is reproving, willing to reprove another, he
should consider thus: ‘Now, are both the Pātimokkhas properly handed down to me
in detail, properly sectioned, properly regulated, properly investigated clause
by clause, as to the linguistic form? Is this state found in me, or not?’ If,
Upāli, the two Pātimokkhas are not properly handed down to the monk in detail …
as to the linguistic form, and if they say: ‘Now where, your reverence, was
this spoken by the Lord?’ and if questioned thus he is not able to explain,
there will be those who will say to him: ‘Please do you, venerable one, master
discipline’—there will be those who speak thus to him. Upāli, if a monk is
reproving, willing to reprove another, when he has considered these five states
within himself, he may reprove the other.</p>
<h2>Things to be established by a reprover</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.19.5.2" href="#Kd.19.5.2"></a>
“Lord, if a monk is reproving, willing to reprove another, having caused how
many states to be set up within himself, may he reprove the other?”</p>
<p>“Upāli, if a monk is reproving, willing to reprove another, having caused five
states to be set up within himself, may he reprove the other. If he thinks, ‘I
will speak at a right time, not at a wrong time; I will speak about fact not
about what is not fact; I will speak with gentleness, not with harshness; I
will speak about what is connected with the goal, not about <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.348" href="#BD.5.348"></a>
what is unconnected with the goal I will speak with a mind of loving-kindness,
not with inner hatred.’ Upāli, if a monk is reproving, willing to reprove
another, having made these five states to be set up within himself, he may
reprove the other.”</p>
<h2>On connected with the reprover and the reproved</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.19.5.3" href="#Kd.19.5.3"></a>
“Lord, in how many ways may remorse be caused in a monk who reproves according
to what is not the rule?” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.250" href="#Vin.2.250"></a></p>
<p>“Upāli, in five ways may remorse be caused in a monk who reproves according to
what is not the rule. One says: ‘The venerable one reproved at a wrong time,
not at a right time—you have need for remorse. The venerable one reproved about
what is not fact, not about what is fact—you have need for remorse. The
venerable one reproved with harshness, not with gentleness … with what is
unconnected with the goal, not with what is connected with the goal … with
inner hatred, not with a mind of loving-kindness—you have need for remorse.’
Upāli, in these five ways may remorse be caused in a monk who reproves
according to what is not the rule. What is the reason for this? To the end that
no other monk might think that one might be reproved about what is not fact.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.19.5.4" href="#Kd.19.5.4"></a>
“But, Lord, in how many ways may no remorse be caused in a monk who has been
reproved according to what is not the rule?”</p>
<p>“Upāli, in five ways may no remorse be caused in a monk who has been reproved
according to what is not the rule. One says: ‘The venerable one reproved at a
wrong time, not at a right time—you have no need for remorse. The venerable one
reproved … with inner hatred, not with a mind of loving-kindness—you have no
need for remorse.’ Upāli, in these five ways may no remorse be caused in a monk
who has been reproved according to what is not the rule.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.19.5.5" href="#Kd.19.5.5"></a>
“Lord, in how many ways may no remorse be caused in a monk who reproves
according to rule?”</p>
<p>“In five ways, Upāli, may no remorse be caused in a monk <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.349" href="#BD.5.349"></a>
who reproves according to rule. One says: ‘The venerable one reproved at a
right time, not at a wrong time—you have no need for remorse. The venerable one
reproved … not with inner hatred, but with a mind of loving-kindness—you have
no need for remorse’. In these five ways, Upāli, may no remorse be caused in a
monk who reproves according to rule. What is the reason? To the end that
another monk should think that one should be reproved about what is fact.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.19.5.6" href="#Kd.19.5.6"></a>
“But, Lord, in how many ways may remorse be caused in a monk who has been
reproved according to rule?”</p>
<p>“In five ways, Upāli, may remorse be caused in a monk who has been reproved
according to rule. One says: ‘The venerable one reproved at a right time, not
at a wrong time—you have need for remorse. The venerable one reproved … not
with inner hatred, but with a mind of loving-kindness—you have need for
remorse’. Upāli, in these five ways may remorse be caused in a monk who has
been reproved according to the rule.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.19.5.7" href="#Kd.19.5.7"></a>
“Lord, if a monk is reproving, willing to reprove another, having attended to
how many states within himself may he reprove the other?”</p>
<p>“Upāli, if a monk is reproving, willing to reprove another, having attended to
five states within himself, he may reprove the other: compassion, seeking
welfare, sympathy, removal of offences, aiming at discipline. Upāli, if a monk
is reproving, willing to reprove another, having attended to these five states
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.251" href="#Vin.2.251"></a>
within himself, he may reprove the other.”</p>
<p>“But, Lord, in how many mental objects should there be support for a monk who
has been reproved?”</p>
<p>“Upāli, there should be support in two mental objects for a monk who has been
reproved: in truth and in being imperturbable.”</p>
<p class="end">Told is the Ninth Section: that on suspending the Pātimokkha.</p>
<div class="uddana">
<h5>In this section there are thirty items. This is its key:</h5>
<p>On an Observance so long as a depraved monk does not depart,
<br>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.350" href="#BD.5.350"></a>
Urged off by Moggallāna, a wonder, in the conqueror’s instruction, /<br>
Deepens and gradual training, fixed (and) do not transgress,<br>
(with) a corpse (and) the Order suspends, streams (and) they lose, /<br>
Streams (and) they attain <i lang="pi">nibbāna</i>, and the one taste is freedom,<br>
many (and) <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline too, (great) beings and the eight <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> men: / <br>
Having made it like the ocean, he tells of excellence in the teaching.<br>
Pātimokkha on an Observance day, “no one knows about us,” / <br>
“In case,” they looked down upon. <br>
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine and ten. / <br>
(One of) moral habit, good habits, right views and mode of livelihood—the four
disciples,<br>
defeat and entailing a Formal Meeting, of expiation, that ought to be
confessed, /<br>
Wrong-doing among the fivefold divisions as they are, <br>
and falling away from moral habit and good habits,<br>
and with what has not been done and has been done in the six divisions as they
are, / <br>
And about defeat and entailing a Formal Meeting, a grave offence and one of
expiation <br>
and likewise one that ought to be confessed and one of wrong-doing and one of
wrong speech, /<br>
Falling away from moral habit and good habits <br>
and falling away from right views and mode of livelihood, <br>
and those eight dones and not dones with one as to moral habit, good habits,
right views, /<br>
Also not dones and dones and likewise the done and not done<br>
are likewise spoken of as ninefold by the system in accordance with fact, /<br>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.351" href="#BD.5.351"></a>
Defeated, still going forward and likewise one who has disavowed,<br>
he submits, he withdraws acceptance, talk on withdrawing acceptance and whoever
/<br>
falls away from moral habit and good habits, and likewise as to falling away
from right views, <br>
seen, heard, suspected, the tenfold, this he should know. / <br>
A monk sees a monk, and another tells what he has seen,<br>
a pure one tells him of it himself: he suspends the Pātimokkha. /<br>
If it removes itself on account of a danger—kings, thieves, fire, water and<br>
human beings and non-human beings and beasts of prey and creeping things, <br>
to life, to the Brahma (faring)—/ <br>
Because of a certain one of the ten, or as to one among the others,<br>

accords with the way. / <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.252" href="#Vin.2.252"></a>
<br>
The right time (and) according to fact (and) connected with the goal, “I will
attract,” “There will be,”<br>
Conduct of body and speech, loving-kindness, great learning, both. /<br>
He should reprove at the right time, about fact, with gentleness, about the
goal, with loving-kindness.<br>
As a speech should dispel remorse caused by what is not the rule / <br>
It dispels the remorse of one who reproves or who is reproved according to
rule. <br>
Compassion, seeking welfare, sympathy, removal, aiming at—/ <br>
The conduct for one reproving is explained by the Self-awakened One.<br>
And the proper course for the reproved one is in the truth as well as in being
imperturbable. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.253" href="#Vin.2.253"></a></p>
