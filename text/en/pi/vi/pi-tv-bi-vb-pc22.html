… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
bathing cloths for the nuns were allowed by the lord. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.279" href="#Vin.4.279"></a>
The group of six nuns, saying: “Bathing cloths are allowed by the lord,” wore
bathing cloths that were not of a (proper) measure; they went about trailing
(these) in front as well as behind. Those who were modest nuns … spread it
about, saying: “How can the group of six nuns wear bathing cloths that are not
of a (proper) measure?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six nuns wear bathing cloths
that are not of a (proper) measure?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the group of six nuns wear bathing cloths that are not of a
(proper) measure? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet)
pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">When a bathing cloth is being made for a nun, it must be made to a (proper)
measure. This is the (proper) measure here: in length four spans according to
the accepted span, in width two spans. For her who exceeds this (measure),
there is an offence of expiation involving cutting down.</span>”</p>

<span class="term">Bathing cloth</span> means:
<span class="gloss">dressed in which, she bathes.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.286" href="#BD.3.286"></a>
<span class="term">Is being made</span> means:
<span class="gloss">making or causing to be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">It must be made to a (proper) measure. This is the (proper) measure here: in
length four spans according to the accepted span, in width two spans</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if she makes it or causes it to be made exceeding this (measure), in the
business there is an offence of wrong-doing; having cut it down on acquisition,
an offence of expiation is to be confessed.</span></p>
<p>If what was incompletely executed by herself she has finished by herself, there
is an offence of expiation. If she makes others finish what was incompletely
executed by herself … If what was incompletely executed by others she has
finished by herself … If she makes others finish what was incompletely executed
by others, there is an offence of expiation. If she makes it or causes it to be
made for another, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If, having acquired what
was made for another, she makes use of it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.22.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.22.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if she makes it to the (proper) measure; if she makes it to
less than the (proper) measure; if having acquired what was made for another
(but) exceeding the (proper) measure, having cut it down, she makes use of it;
if she makes a canopy or a ground-covering or a screen-wall or a mattress or a
squatting-mat; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
