<h3>The Book of the Threes</h3>
<h1>53 A Certain Brahmin</h1>

<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>
Then a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One … and said to him:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“Master Gotama, it is said: ‘A directly visible Dhamma, a directly visible
Dhamma.’ In what way is the Dhamma directly visible, immediate, inviting one
to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
(1) “Brahmin, one excited by lust, overcome by lust, with mind obsessed by
it,
<a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.157"></a>
intends for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, and for the
affliction of both, and he experiences mental suffering and dejection. But
when lust is abandoned, he does not intend for his own affliction, for the
affliction of others, or for the affliction of both, and he does not
experience mental suffering and dejection. It is in this way that the Dhamma
is directly visible….</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
(2) “One full of hate, overcome by hatred, with mind obsessed by it,
intends for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, and for the
affliction of both, and he experiences mental suffering and dejection. But
when hatred is abandoned, he does not intend for his own affliction, for the
affliction of others, or for the affliction of both, and he does not
experience mental suffering and dejection. It is in this way, too, that the
Dhamma is directly visible….</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
(3) “One who is deluded, overcome by delusion, with mind obsessed by it,
intends for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, and for the
affliction of both, and he experiences mental suffering and dejection. But
when delusion is abandoned, he does not intend for his own affliction, for
the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both, and he does not
experience mental suffering and dejection. It is in this way, too, that the
Dhamma is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see,
applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made
the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had
been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was
lost, or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can
see forms. I now go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the
Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from
today has gone for refuge for life.”</p>
