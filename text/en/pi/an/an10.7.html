Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged
greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial
talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Sāriputta:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“Friend Sāriputta, could a bhikkhu obtain such a state of concentration
that (1) he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth; (2) of
water in relation to water; (3) of fire in relation to fire; (4) of air in
relation to air; (5) of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the
base of the infinity of space;
<a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.9"></a>
(6) of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of
the infinity of consciousness; (7) of the base of nothingness in relation to
the base of nothingness; (8) of the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception; (9) of this world in relation to this
world; (10) of the other world in relation to the other world, but he would
still be percipient?”</p>
<p>“He could, friend Ānanda.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“But how, friend Sāriputta, could he obtain such a state of concentration?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“On one occasion, friend Ānanda, I was dwelling right here in Sāvatthī in
the Blind Men’s Grove. There I attained such a state of concentration that I
was not percipient of earth in relation to earth; of water in relation to
water; of fire in relation to fire; of air in relation to air; of the base
of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space;
of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of the
infinity of consciousness; of the base of nothingness in relation to the
base of nothingness; of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in
relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; of this world
in relation to this world; of the other world in relation to the other
world, but I was still percipient.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
“But of what was the Venerable Sāriputta percipient on that occasion?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
“One perception arose and another perception ceased in me: ‘The cessation
of existence is nibbāna; the cessation of existence is nibbāna.’ Just as,
when a fire of twigs is burning, one flame arises and another flame ceases,
so one perception
<a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.10"></a>
arose and another perception ceased in me: ‘The cessation of existence is
nibbāna; the cessation of existence is nibbāna.’ On that occasion, friend, I
was percipient: ‘The cessation of existence is nibbāna.’”</p>
