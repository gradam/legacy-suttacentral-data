“Bhikkhus, there are these five powers. What five? The power of faith, the
power of energy, the power of mindfulness, the power of concentration, and
the power of wisdom.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
(1) “And what, bhikkhus, is the power of faith? Here, a noble disciple is
endowed with faith. He places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata
thus: ‘The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened …
<span class="add show">as in 5:2</span> … the Enlightened One, the Blessed
One.’
<a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.11"></a>
This is called the power of faith.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
(2) “And what is the power of energy? Here, a noble disciple has aroused
energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome
qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of
cultivating wholesome qualities. This is called the power of energy.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
(3) “And what is the power of mindfulness? Here, the noble disciple is
mindful, possessing supreme mindfulness and alertness, one who remembers and
recollects what was done and said long ago. This is called the power of
mindfulness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
(4) “And what is the power of concentration? Here, secluded from sensual
pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in
the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion,
accompanied by thought and examination. With the subsiding of thought and
examination, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal
placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born
of concentration, without thought and examination. With the fading away as
well of rapture, he dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly
comprehending, he experiences pleasure with the body; he enters and dwells
in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: ‘He is equanimous,
mindful, one who dwells happily.’ With the abandoning of pleasure and pain,
and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, he enters and
dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has
purification of mindfulness by equanimity. This is called the power of
concentration.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
(5) “And what is the power of wisdom? Here, a noble disciple is wise; he
possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble
and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. This is
called the power of wisdom.</p>
<p>“These, bhikkhus, are the five powers.”</p>
