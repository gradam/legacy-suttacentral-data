“Bhikkhus, I do not praise even a standstill in wholesome qualities, much
less decline. I praise only growth in wholesome qualities, not a standstill
or deterioration.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“And how is there deterioration—not a standstill or growth—in wholesome
qualities? Here, a bhikkhu has a certain degree of faith, virtuous behavior,
learning, renunciation, wisdom, and discernment. Those qualities of his do
not remain the same or increase. This, I say, is deterioration rather than a
standstill or growth in wholesome qualities. Thus there is deterioration—not
a standstill or growth—in wholesome qualities.</p>

“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is not skilled in the ways of others’ minds
<span class="add show">should train</span>: ‘I will be skilled in the ways
of my own mind.’ … [97–98] …
<span class="add show">as in 10:51 down to:</span> … But if, by such
self-examination, a bhikkhu knows: ‘I am often without longing … and
concentrated,’ then he should base himself on those same wholesome qualities
and make a further effort to reach the destruction of the taints.”</p>
