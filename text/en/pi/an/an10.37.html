<h1>37 Schism (1)</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhante, it is said: ‘Schism in the Saṅgha, schism in the Saṅgha.’ How, Bhante, is there schism in the Saṅgha?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Here, Upāli, (1) bhikkhus explain non-Dhamma as Dhamma, (2) and Dhamma as non-Dhamma. (3) They explain non-discipline as discipline, <a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.74"></a> and (4) discipline as non-discipline. (5) They explain what has not been stated and uttered by the Tathāgata as having been stated and uttered by him, and (6) what has been stated and uttered by the Tathāgata as not having been stated and uttered by him. (7) They explain what has not been practiced by the Tathāgata as having been practiced by him, and (8) what has been practiced by the Tathāgata as not having been practiced by him. (9) They explain what has not been prescribed by the Tathāgata as having been prescribed by him, and (10) what has been prescribed by the Tathāgata as not having been prescribed by him. On these ten grounds they withdraw and go apart. They perform legal acts separately and recite the Pātimokkha separately. It is in this way, Upāli, that there is schism in the Saṅgha.”</p>
