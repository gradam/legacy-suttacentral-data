“Bhikkhus, (1) for an immoral person, for one deficient in virtuous
behavior, (2) right concentration lacks its proximate cause. When there is
no right concentration, for one deficient in right concentration, (3) the
knowledge and vision of things as they really are lacks its proximate cause.
When there is no knowledge and vision of things as they really are, for one
deficient in the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, (4)
disenchantment and dispassion lack their proximate cause. When there is no
disenchantment and dispassion, for one deficient in disenchantment and
dispassion, (5) the knowledge and vision of liberation lacks its proximate
cause.</p>

“Suppose there is a tree deficient in branches and foliage. Then its shoots
do not grow to fullness; also its bark,
<a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.20"></a>
softwood, and heartwood do not grow to fullness. So too, for an immoral
person, one deficient in virtuous behavior, right concentration lacks its
proximate cause. When there is no right concentration … the knowledge and
vision of liberation lacks its proximate cause.</p>

“Bhikkhus, (1) for a virtuous person, for one whose behavior is virtuous,
(2) right concentration possesses its proximate cause. When there is right
concentration, for one possessing right concentration, (3) the knowledge and
vision of things as they really are possesses its proximate cause. When
there is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, for one
possessing the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, (4)
disenchantment and dispassion possess their proximate cause. When there is
disenchantment and dispassion, for one possessing disenchantment and
dispassion, (5) the knowledge and vision of liberation possesses its
proximate cause.</p>

“Suppose there is a tree possessing branches and foliage. Then its shoots
grow to fullness; also its bark, softwood, and heartwood grow to fullness.
So too, for a virtuous person, one whose behavior is virtuous, right
concentration possesses its proximate cause. When there is right
concentration … the knowledge and vision of liberation possesses its
proximate cause.”</p>
