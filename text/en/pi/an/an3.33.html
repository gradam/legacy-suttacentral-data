Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to
him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“Sāriputta, I can teach the Dhamma briefly; I can teach the Dhamma in
detail; I can teach the Dhamma both briefly and in detail. It is those who
can understand that are rare.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“It is the time for this, Blessed One. It is the time for this, Fortunate
One. The Blessed One should teach the Dhamma briefly; he should teach the
Dhamma in detail; he should teach the Dhamma both briefly and in detail.
There will be those who can understand the Dhamma.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“Therefore, Sāriputta, you should train yourselves thus: (1) ‘There will be
no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to
this conscious body; (2) there will be no I-making, mine-making, and
underlying tendency to conceit in regard to all external objects; and (3) we
will enter and dwell in that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom,
through which there is no more I-making, mine-making, and underlying
tendency to conceit for one who enters and dwells in it.’ It is in this way,
Sāriputta, that you should train yourselves.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
“When, Sāriputta, a bhikkhu
<a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.134"></a>
has no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard
to this conscious body; when he has no I-making, mine-making, and underlying
tendency to conceit in regard to all external objects; and when he enters
and dwells in that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, through which
there is no more I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit
for one who enters and dwells in it, he is called a bhikkhu who has cut off
craving, stripped off the fetter, and, by completely breaking through
conceit, has made an end of suffering. And it was with reference to this
that I said in the Pārāyana, in ‘The Questions of Udaya’:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
“The abandoning of both<br>
sensual perceptions and dejection;<br>
the dispelling of dullness,<br>
the warding off of remorse;<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>
“purified equanimity and mindfulness<br>
preceded by reflection on the Dhamma:<br>
this, I say, is emancipation by final knowledge,<br>
the breaking up of ignorance.”<br></p>
</blockquote>
