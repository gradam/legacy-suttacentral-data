</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, an irreverent and undeferential bhikkhu is not capable of achieving growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline. What five? (1) An irreverent and undeferential bhikkhu devoid of faith is not capable of achieving growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline. (2) An irreverent and undeferential bhikkhu who is morally shameless … (3) An irreverent and undeferential bhikkhu who is morally reckless … (4) An irreverent and undeferential bhikkhu who is lazy … (5) An irreverent and undeferential bhikkhu who is unwise is not capable of achieving growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline. Possessing these five qualities, an irreverent and undeferential bhikkhu is not capable of achieving growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline.</p>
