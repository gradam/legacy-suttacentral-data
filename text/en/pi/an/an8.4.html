“Bhikkhus, possessing eight qualities, a bhikkhu is displeasing and
disagreeable to his fellow monks and is neither respected nor esteemed by
them. What eight? Here, a bhikkhu is (1) desirous of gains, (2) honor, and
(3) reputation; (4) he does not know the proper time and (5) does not know
moderation; (6) he is impure; (7) he speaks much; and (8) he insults and
reviles his fellow monks. Possessing these eight qualities, a bhikkhu is
displeasing and disagreeable to his fellow monks and is neither respected
nor esteemed by them.</p>
