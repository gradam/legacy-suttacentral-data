</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu is practicing for the welfare of others but not for his own welfare. What five? (1) Here, a bhikkhu is not accomplished in virtuous behavior himself but he encourages others to become accomplished in virtuous behavior; (2) he is not accomplished in concentration himself but he encourages others to become accomplished in concentration; (3) he is not accomplished in wisdom himself but he encourages others to become accomplished in wisdom; (4) he is not accomplished in liberation himself but he encourages others to become accomplished in liberation; (5) he is not accomplished in the knowledge and vision of liberation himself but he encourages others to become accomplished in the knowledge and vision of liberation. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is practicing for the welfare of others but not for his own welfare.”</p>
