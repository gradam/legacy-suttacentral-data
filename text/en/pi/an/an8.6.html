“Bhikkhus, these eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the
world revolves around these eight worldly conditions. What eight? Gain and
loss, disrepute and fame, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain. These
eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world revolves
around these eight worldly conditions.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“Bhikkhus, an uninstructed worldling meets gain and loss, disrepute and
fame, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain. An instructed noble disciple
also meets gain and loss, disrepute and fame, blame and praise, and pleasure
and pain. What
<a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.158"></a>
is the distinction, the disparity, the difference between an instructed
noble disciple and an uninstructed worldling with regard to this?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“Bhante, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed
One, take recourse in the Blessed One. It would be good if the Blessed One
would clear up the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from him, the
bhikkhus will retain it in mind.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“Then listen, bhikkhus, and attend closely. I will speak.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
“Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
“(1) Bhikkhus, when an uninstructed worldling meets with gain, he does not
reflect thus: <em>‘</em>This gain that I have met is impermanent, suffering,
and subject to change.’ He does not understand it as it really is. (2) When
he meets with loss … (3) … fame … (4) … disrepute … (5) … blame … (6) …
praise … (7) … pleasure … (8) … pain, he does not reflect thus: <em>‘</em>
This pain that I have met is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change.’
He does not understand it as it really is.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>
“Gain obsesses his mind, and loss obsesses his mind. Fame obsesses his
mind, and disrepute obsesses his mind. Blame obsesses his mind, and praise
obsesses his mind. Pleasure obsesses his mind, and pain obsesses his mind.
He is attracted to gain and repelled by loss. He is attracted to fame and
repelled by disrepute. He is attracted to praise and repelled by blame. He
is attracted to pleasure and repelled by pain. Thus involved with attraction
and repulsion, he is not freed from birth, from old age and death, from
sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; he is not freed from
suffering, I say.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>
“But, bhikkhus, (1) when an instructed noble disciple meets with gain, he
reflects thus: <em>‘</em>This gain that I have met is impermanent,
suffering, and subject to change.’ He thus understands it as it really is.
(2) When he meets with loss … (3) … fame … (4) …
<a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.159"></a>
disrepute … (5) … blame … (6) … praise … (7) … pleasure … (8) … pain, he
reflects thus: <em>‘</em>This pain that I have met is impermanent,
suffering, and subject to change.’ He thus understands it as it really is.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>
“Gain does not obsess his mind, and loss does not obsess his mind. Fame
does not obsess his mind, and disrepute does not obsess his mind. Blame does
not obsess his mind, and praise does not obsess his mind. Pleasure does not
obsess his mind, and pain does not obsess his mind. He is not attracted to
gain or repelled by loss. He is not attracted to fame or repelled by
disrepute. He is not attracted to praise or repelled by blame. He is not
attracted to pleasure or repelled by pain. Having thus discarded attraction
and repulsion, he is freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow,
lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; he is freed from suffering, I say.</p>

“This, bhikkhus, is the distinction, the disparity, the difference between
an instructed noble disciple and an uninstructed worldling.”</p>
