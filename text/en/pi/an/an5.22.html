“(1) Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is irreverent and undeferential, and his
behavior is uncongenial to his fellow monks, it is impossible for him to
fulfill the factor of proper conduct. (2) Without fulfilling the factor of
proper conduct, it is impossible for him to fulfill the factor of a trainee.
(3) Without fulfilling the factor of a trainee, it is impossible for him to
fulfill the aggregate of virtuous behavior. (4) Without fulfilling the
aggregate of virtuous behavior, it is impossible for him to fulfill the
aggregate of concentration. (5) Without fulfilling the aggregate of
concentration, it is impossible for him to fulfill the aggregate of wisdom.</p>

“(1) But, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is reverential and deferential, and his
behavior is congenial to his fellow monks, it is possible for him to fulfill
the factor of proper conduct. (2) Having fulfilled the factor of proper
conduct, it is possible for him to fulfill the factor of a trainee. (3)
Having fulfilled the factor of a trainee, it is possible for him to fulfill
the aggregate of virtuous behavior. (4) Having fulfilled the aggregate of
virtuous behavior, it is possible for him to fulfill the aggregate of
concentration.
