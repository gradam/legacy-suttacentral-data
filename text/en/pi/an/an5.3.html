“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu dwells in suffering in this
very life—with distress, anguish, and fever—and with the breakup of the
body, after death, a bad destination can be expected for him. What five?
Here, a bhikkhu is devoid of faith, morally shameless, morally reckless,
lazy, and unwise. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu dwells in
suffering in this very life—with distress, anguish, and fever—and with the
breakup of the body, after death, he can expect a bad destination.</p>

“Bhikkhus, possessing five <span class="add show">other</span> qualities, a
bhikkhu dwells happily in this very life—without distress, anguish, and
fever—and with the breakup of the body, after death, a good destination can
be expected for him. What five? Here, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith, has a
sense of moral shame, has moral dread, and is energetic and wise. Possessing
these five qualities, a bhikkhu dwells happily in this very life—without
distress, anguish, and fever—and with the breakup of the body, after death,
a good destination can be expected for him.”</p>
