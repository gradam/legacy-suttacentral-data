Then the Venerable Upāli approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him,
sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“Bhante, on how many grounds has the Tathāgata prescribed the training
rules for his disciples and recited the Pātimokkha?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“It is, Upāli, on ten grounds that the Tathāgata has prescribed the
training rules for his disciples and recited the Pātimokkha. What ten? (1)
For the well-being of the Saṅgha; (2) for the ease of the Saṅgha; (3) for
keeping recalcitrant persons in check; (4) so that well-behaved bhikkhus can
dwell at ease; (5) for the restraint of taints pertaining to this present
life; (6) for the dispelling of taints pertaining to future lives; (7) so
that those without confidence might gain confidence; and (8) for increasing
<span class="add show">the confidence</span> of those with confidence; (9)
for the continuation of the good Dhamma; and (10) for promoting discipline.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“It is on these ten grounds that the Tathāgata has prescribed the training
rules for his disciples and recited the Pātimokkha.”</p>
