<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Here, (1)–(2) a bhikkhu is one who listens and makes others listen; (3)–(4) he is one who learns well and makes others learn; (5)–(6) he is one who understands and communicates well; (7) he is skilled in <span class="add show">knowing</span> what is relevant and what irrelevant; and (8) he does not foment quarrels. Possessing these eight qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of going on a mission.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Here, Sāriputta is one who listens and who makes others listen … he does not foment quarrels. Possessing these eight qualities, Sāriputta is worthy of going on a mission.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>One who does not tremble when he arrives<br>
at an assembly with fierce debaters;<br>
who does not omit words<br>
or conceal his message;<br>
who speaks without hesitation,<br>
and does not waver when asked a question;<br>
a bhikkhu like this is worthy<br>
of going on a mission.<br></p>
