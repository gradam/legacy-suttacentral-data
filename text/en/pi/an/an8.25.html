On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at
Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Park. Then Mahānāma the Sakyan approached
the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p>“In what way, Bhante, is one a lay follower?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“When, Mahānāma, one has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the
Saṅgha, in that way one is a lay follower.”</p>
<p>“In what way, Bhante, is a lay follower virtuous?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“When, Mahānāma, a lay follower abstains from the destruction of life, from
taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and
from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness, in that way
a lay follower is virtuous.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“In what way, Bhante, is a lay follower practicing for his own welfare but
not for the welfare of others?”
<a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.221"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
(1) “When, Mahānāma, a lay follower is himself accomplished in faith but
does not encourage others to accomplish faith; (2) when he is himself
accomplished in virtuous behavior but does not encourage others to
accomplish virtuous behavior; (3) when he is himself accomplished in
generosity but does not encourage others to accomplish generosity; (4) when
he himself wants to see bhikkhus but does not encourage others to see
bhikkhus; (5) when he himself wants to hear the good Dhamma but does not
encourage others to hear the good Dhamma; (6) when he himself retains in
mind the teachings he has heard but does not encourage others to retain the
teachings in mind; (7) when he himself examines the meaning of the teachings
that have been retained in mind but does not encourage others to examine
their meaning; (8) when he himself has understood the meaning and the Dhamma
and practices in accordance with the Dhamma, but does not encourage others
to do so: it is in this way, Mahānāma, that a lay follower is practicing for
his own welfare but not for the welfare of others.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
“In what way, Bhante, is a lay follower practicing for his own welfare and
for the welfare of others?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>
(1) “When, Mahānāma, a lay follower is himself accomplished in faith and
also encourages others to accomplish faith; (2) when he is himself
accomplished in virtuous behavior and also encourages others to accomplish
virtuous behavior; (3) when he is himself accomplished in generosity and
also encourages others to accomplish generosity; (4) when he himself wants
to see bhikkhus and also encourages others to see bhikkhus; (5) when he
himself wants to hear the good Dhamma and also encourages others to hear the
good Dhamma; (6) when he himself retains in mind the teachings he has heard
and also encourages others to retain the teachings in mind; (7) when he
himself examines the meaning of the teachings that have been retained in
mind and also encourages others to examine their meaning; (8) when he
himself understands the meaning
<a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.222"></a>
and the Dhamma and then practices in accordance with the Dhamma, and also
encourages others to practice in accordance with the Dhamma: it is in this
way, Mahānāma, that a lay follower is practicing for his own welfare and
also for the welfare of others.”</p>
