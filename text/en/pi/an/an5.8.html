</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities a bhikkhu falls away and is not established in the good Dhamma. What five? (1) A bhikkhu devoid of faith falls away and is not established <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.7"></a> in the good Dhamma. (2) A morally shameless bhikkhu … (3) A morally reckless bhikkhu … (4) A lazy bhikkhu … (5) An unwise bhikkhu falls away and is not established in the good Dhamma. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu falls away and is not established in the good Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Bhikkhus, possessing five <span class="add show">other</span> qualities a bhikkhu does not fall away but is established in the good Dhamma. What five? (1) A bhikkhu endowed with faith does not fall away but is established in the good Dhamma. (2) A bhikkhu who has a sense of moral shame … (3) A bhikkhu who has moral dread … (4) An energetic bhikkhu … (5) A wise bhikkhu does not fall away but is established in the good Dhamma. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu does not fall away but is established in the good Dhamma.”</p>
