<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>(1) “Here, someone destroys life; he is murderous, bloody-handed, given to blows and violence, merciless to living beings. (2) He takes what is not given … (3) He engages in sexual misconduct … (4) He speaks falsehood … (5) He speaks divisively … (6) He speaks harshly <a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.286"></a> … (7) He indulges in idle chatter … (8) He is full of longing … (9) He has a mind of ill will and intentions of hate … (10) He holds wrong view and has an incorrect perspective thus: ‘There is nothing given … there are in the world no ascetics and brahmins of right conduct and right practice who, having realized this world and the other world for themselves by direct knowledge, make them known to others.’ One possessing these ten qualities is deposited in hell as if brought there.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>(1)“Here, someone, having abandoned the destruction of life, abstains from the destruction of life; with the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, he dwells compassionate toward all living beings. (2) Having abandoned the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given … (3) Having abandoned sexual misconduct, he abstains from sexual misconduct … (4) Having abandoned false speech, he abstains from false speech … (5) Having abandoned divisive speech, he abstains from divisive speech … (6) Having abandoned harsh speech, he abstains from harsh speech … (7) Having abandoned idle chatter, he abstains from idle chatter … (8) He is without longing … (9) He is of good will … (10) He holds right view and has a correct perspective thus: ‘There is what is given … there are in the world ascetics and brahmins of right conduct and right practice who, having realized this world and the other world for themselves by direct knowledge, make them known to others.’ One possessing these ten qualities is deposited in heaven as if brought there.”</p>
