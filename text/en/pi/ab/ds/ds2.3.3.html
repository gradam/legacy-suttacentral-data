<p>He sets himself to restrain that which might give occasion for wicked states, covetous, dejected, to flow in over him, were he to dwell unrestrained as to the sense of sight.</p>
<p>He keeps watch over this faculty of sight, and attains to mastery over it. And so in like manner, when he hears a sound with the ear … smells an odour with the nose … tastes a sapid with the tongue … feels a tangible with the body … recognises an idea with the mind, he is not entranced with the general appearance and the details of it.</p>
<p>He sets himself to restrain that which might give occasion for wicked states, covetous, dejected, to flow in over him, were he to dwell unrestrained as to the mental faculty.</p>
<p>He keeps watch over the mental faculty, and attains to mastery over it.</p>
<p>That these six faculties should be thus guarded, tended, watched over, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en353"></a>restrained, is what is called having the doors of the faculties guarded.</p>
