<p><a class="pc" id="pc355"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs21.6.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you., mean that they persist in the eastern quarter? You deny. Then you contradict yourself. You assent. Then I ask, How is <span class="add">this Eastern</span> Buddha named? What is his family? his clan? what the names of his parents? or of his pair of elect disciples? or of his body-servant? What sort of raiment or bowl does he bear? and in what village, town, city, kingdom, or country?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs21.6.2"></a>Or does a Buddha persist in the southern… western… northern quarter? or in the nadir? or in the zenith? Of any such an one I ask you the same questions… . Or does he persist in the realm of the four great Kings? or in the heaven of the Three-and-Thirty? or in that of the Yama or the Tusita devas? or in that of the devas who rejoice in creating, or of those who exploit the creations of others? or in the Brahma-world? If you assent, I ask you further as before… .</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
