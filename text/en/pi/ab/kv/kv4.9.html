<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<h1>4.9. More about Endowment</h1>
</div>


<p><a class="pc" id="pc170"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That a person who is practising in order to realize Arahantship possesses <span class="supplied">as a persistent distinct endowment</span> the preceding three fruitions.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.9.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> You say, in fact, that such a person is endowed with, or possesses four contacts, four feelings, four perceptions, volitions, thoughts, four faiths, energies, mindfulnesses, <i>samādhi</i>s, understandings—which cannot be.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.9.2"></a>Do you make an analogous assertion as to one who is practising for the Third or Second Paths? An analogous<a class="pc" id="pc171"></a> paradox will apply in that case; and you must <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.9.3"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.9.4"></a> be able to describe such persons in terms of lower stages, e.g. one practising for the topmost stage in terms of one who has only got to the first—which is anomalous.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.9.5"></a>But can a person who is a proximate candidate for Arahantship be described in terms of a Stream-Winner? Can he be both at the same time? Even if he be a Never- Returner, is he rightly so described when he is in process of becoming Arahant?<a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.9.6"></a> Similarly for a candidate for the Third and Second Fruitions.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.9.7"></a>Would you not rather maintain that a person practising in order to realize Arahantship had evolved past the fruition of Stream-Winning?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.9.8"></a>Or do you maintain that one so evolved was still holding that first Fruit <span class="supplied">as a distinctive quality</span>? For then you must also hold that he also remains possessed of those evil qualities which as Stream-Winner he has evolved out of—which is absurd.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.9.9"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.9.18"></a>A similar argument applies to a proximate? candidate for Arahantship (Fourth Fruit) and the Second Path and Fruit; to such a candidate and the Third Path and Fruit; to a proximate candidate for the Third Fruit and the First and Second Paths and Fruits; and to a proximate candidate for the Second Fruit, and the First Path and Fruit.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.9.19"></a><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas and Andhakas:</span> If our proposition is wrong, surely you would nevertheless say that a person who is a proximate candidate for realizing Arahantship had both won the preceding three Fruits, and had not fallen away from them?</p>

<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>

<p><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas and Andhakas:</span> Surely then he is still possessed of them. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.9.20"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.9.21"></a> And so for candidates in the Third, Second and First Paths.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.9.22"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Assuming that he is still possessed of the three Fruits, do you also admit that, having attained to all four Paths, he is still possessed of all the Paths? Of course you do not; <span class="supplied">there at least you see my point</span>.</p>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc172"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.9.23"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.9.24"></a> Neither do you admit a similar possession in other candidates.</p>
