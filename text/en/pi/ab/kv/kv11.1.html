<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<h1>11.1. Of Three Facts about Latent Bias</h1>
</div>


<p><a class="pc" id="pc253"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> (i.) That latent bias is unmoral (indeterminate).</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.1.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But are you prepared to identify latent bias with any of the morally indeterminate ultimates—with resultant or with inoperative indeterminates, with matter or body, with <i>Nibbāna</i>, or with the organs and objects of sense? Of course you deny this… .</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.1.2"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.1.8"></a>Again, take each form of bias—unless you can prove that each form is something different in kind or degree from the corresponding kind off fetter,” or “outburst,” or “flood,” or “yoke,” or “hindrance,” which are indisputably immoral states, you cannot call the corresponding form of bias unmoral, whether it be sensual desires, or enmity, or conceit, or mere opinion, or doubt, or lust of life, or delusion.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.1.9"></a><span class="add">Mahāsaṅghikas and Sammitīyas:</span> Well, but would you say that an average man, while thinking moral or unmoral thoughts, had latent bias?</p>

<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Yes.</p>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc254"></a><span class="add">Mahāsaṅghikas and Sammitīyas:</span> Do you tell me then that good and bad ideas can come together side by side in consciousness?</p>

<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> No, that cannot truly be said… . </p>

<p><span class="add">Mahāsaṅghikas and Sammitīyas:</span> Then latent bias must be unmoral.</p>

<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then you must go further and admit that lust is unmoral, because you will agree that the average man, when thinking good or unmoral thoughts, has not got rid the while of the root-condition of lust or greed… . </p>

<p>(ii.) That latent bias is without moral motive (or root-condition).</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.1.10"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Since you cannot identify latent bias with any ultimate <span class="cr">Kv11.1.1</span>, these being admittedly independent of the root-conditions or <em>hetu’s</em>, it only remains for you to show that each form of latent bias is something different in kind or degree from the corresponding kind of “fetter,” or “outburst,” or “flood,” or “yoke,” or “hindrance,” which are indisputably motived by the root-conditions of lust, or enmity, or delusion… . </p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.1.11"></a><span class="add">Mahāsaṅghikas and Sammitīyas:</span> You urge that latent biases are not uncon-ditioned by these root-conditions, and you still maintain that an average person, while thinking moral or unmoral thoughts, is possessed the while by forms of latent bias. But you deny that these forms are conditioned by any of the root-conditions accompanying those thoughts. Surely then latent-bias is unconditioned.</p>

<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> You admit that such an average person is still possessed of lust, even while thinking moral or unmoral thoughts. But you deny that that lust is conditioned by the <i>hetu</i> accompanying those thoughts. According to you, therefore, lust is unconditioned—which is absurd.</p>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc255"></a>(iii.) That latent bias is independent of consciousness.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.1.12"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.1.19"></a><em>Argued</em> verbatim <em>as in</em> <span class="cr">Kv9.4.1</span>–<span class="cr">Kv9.4.8</span>, <em>substituting</em> “independent of” <em>or</em> “conjoined with” “consciousness” <em>for</em> “without” <em>or</em> with” “mental object” <em>respectively</em>.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.1.20"></a><span class="add">Mahāsaṅghikas and Sammitīyas:</span> You affirm that an average person is still possessed of latent bias, even while thinking moral or unmoral thoughts. But you deny that the latent bias is conjoined with such thoughts. Surely then latent bias is independent of mind.</p>

<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If, as you admit, such a person is still possessed of lust while thinking moral or immoral thoughts, your denial that lust is conjoined with those thoughts does not necessarily lead to the false conclusion that lust is independent of mind.</p>
