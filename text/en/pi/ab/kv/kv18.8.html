<h1>18.8. On Hearing Sound in Jhāna</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc331"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That one who has attained <i>jhāna</i> hears sound.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18.8.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If so, it must be equally allowed that he can also see, smell, taste and touch objects. This you deny… You must also allow that he enters .Jhana enjoying auditory consciousness. You deny, for you agree that <i>samādhi</i> arises in one who is enjoying mental objects as such? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18.8.2"></a>But if you admit that anyone who is actually enjoying sounds hears sounds, and that <i>samādhi</i> is the property of one who is actually enjoying mental objects as such, you should not affirm that one in the <i>samādhi</i> of <i>jhāna</i> hears sounds. If you insist that he does, you have here two parallel mental procedures going on at the same time… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18.8.3"></a><span class="add">Pubbaseliyans:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One that sound is a thorn for First <i>jhāna</i>? Hence one in <i>jhāna</i> can surely hear sound.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> You say that one in <i>jhāna</i> can hear sound, and quote the Word as to it being for First <i>jhāna</i> a “thorn.” Now it was further said that thought applied and sustained is a thorn for Second <i>jhāna</i>—does one in Second <i>jhāna</i> have applied and sustained thought?… Again, it was further said that the mental factor last eliminated is a thorn<a class="pc" id="pc332"></a> for the stage newly attained—zest for Third, respiration for Fourth <i>jhāna</i>, perception of visible objects for consciousness of space-infinity, this perception for that of consciousness as infinite, this perception for that of nothingness, perception and feeling for cessation of these in trance. Now is “the thorn “actually present on the winning of the stage whence it is pronounced to be a thorn? If not, then how can you say that the “thorn “of hearing sound is present to one in First <i>jhāna</i>?</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
