<h1>5.6. Of Popular Knowledge</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc180"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That it is wrong to say: Popular knowledge has only truth as its object and nothing else.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.6.1"></a><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> You admit, do you not, that one who attains <i>jhāna</i> by way of the earth-artifice, has knowledge? Does not that earth-artifice come under popular truth?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> Then why exempt popular knowledge from the search for truth?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.6.2"></a>The same argument applies to the other artifices, and to gifts as stated above (V. 5).</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.6.3"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then according to you, popular knowledge <em>has</em> only Truth as its object. But is it the object of popular knowledge to understand the fact and nature of Suffering, to put away the Cause, to realize the Cessation, to develop the Path thereto? You must deny. (Hence the need for a distinction between truths.)</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
