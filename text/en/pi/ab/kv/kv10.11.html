<h1>10.11. Of Non-Intimation as Immoral</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc252"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That acts not intimating <span class="add">a moral purpose</span> are immoral</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10.11.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But the conduct that is immoral—taking life, theft, fornication, lying, intemperance—do you affirm that these are so many modes of non-intimation? You deny. (Then they are intimative, and some immoral acts are therefore intimative <span class="add">of moral purpose</span>.)</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10.11.2"></a>If anyone giving in charity has resolved on some evil deed, do his merit and his demerit both grow thereby? If you assent, you are involved in two sets of mental procedure. And if you assent to this anomaly, you have good and bad, low and excellent, sinister and radiant states of mind simultaneously present, when, in fact, as the Exalted One said, they are as far apart as earth and sky, etc.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10.11.3"></a> Similarly for all courtesies shown by one who has resolved on some evil deed.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10.11.4"></a><span class="add">Mahāsaṅghikas:</span> But an evil deed, you admit, had been resolved upon, hence it is right to say that acts non-intimative of a <em>moral</em> thought behind them are immoral.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
