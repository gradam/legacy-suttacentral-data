<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<h1>19.3. Of the Fruits of Life in Religion</h1>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc336"></a> <span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the fruit of recluseship is unconditioned.</p>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc337"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.3.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you then identify that “fruit” with <i>Nibbāna</i>: the Shelter, the Cave, the Refuge, the Goal, the Undying, the Deathless? Or are there two “unconditioneds”? You deny both alternatives <span class="supplied">but you must assent to one or the other</span>. If to the latter, I ask are they both… <i>Nibbāna</i>s, and is there one higher than the other, … or is there a boundary… an interstice between them?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.3.2"></a>Again, do you imply that recluseship itself is unconditioned? “No, conditioned,” you say. Then is its fruit or reward conditioned?… </p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.3.3"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.3.4"></a>You admit, again, that the four stages in the recluse’s Ariyan Path—the Four Paths—are conditioned. Yet you would deny that the Four Fruits are conditioned!</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.3.5"></a>In fact, you would have in these four and <i>Nibbāna</i> five “unconditioneds.” Or if you identify the four with <i>Nibbāna</i>, you then get five sorts of <i>Nibbāna</i>, five Shelters, and so on… .</p>
