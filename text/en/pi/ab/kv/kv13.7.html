<h1>13.7. Of <i>jhāna</i> as Enjoyment</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc277"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the expert enjoys <i>jhāna</i>, and the desire for <i>jhāna</i> has <i>jhāna</i> as its object.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc278"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.7.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you mean that a given <i>jhāna</i> is the mental object to that same <i>jhāna</i>? If you deny, your proposition falls. If you assent, you must equally admit that he touches a given mental contact with the same contact, feels a given feeling with that feeling, and so on for perception, volition, thought, applied and sustained intellecttion, zest, mindfulness, understanding… . </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.7.2"></a>You admit that desire for <i>jhāna</i> and <i>jhāna</i> itself are forms of conscious experience? But are you prepared to admit further that they constitute two conscious processes going on at once? You deny; then your former admission is invalid. And if you admit further that desire for <i>jhāna</i> is wrong while <i>jhāna</i> itself is good, you bring the good and the bad up against each other in the same consciousness—things as “far apart as earth and sky,” etc.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.7.3"></a><span class="add">Andhakas:</span> But, if I am wrong, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Take the case, <i>bhikkhus</i>, of a <i>bhikkhu</i> who, aloof from sensuous ideas, aloof from evil ideas, entering into, abides in First <i>jhāna</i>: he enjoys it, he yearns over it, and by it he is delighted.”</span></p>
<p>Hence surely the expert enjoys <i>jhāna</i>, and the desire for <i>jhāna</i> has <i>jhāna</i> as a mental object.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
