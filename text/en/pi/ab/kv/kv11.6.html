<h1>11.6. Of <i>Samādhi</i></h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc260"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the continuity of consciousness is <i>samādhi</i> of mind (<i>samādhi</i>).</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.6.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Your statement must include of course past and future states of consciousness in the series. You forgot that, and you must agree that the past having ceased and the future being unborn, it is not right to say that they form a <span class="supplied">present</span> concentrated state of mind.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc261"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.6.2"></a> <span class="add">Sarvāstivādins and Uttarapāthakas:</span> Then is <i>samādhi</i> confined to a momentary conscious unit?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Sarvāstivādins and Uttarapāthakas:</span> But if you could affirm that <i>samādhi</i> is involved in each momentary unit of consciousness, you should say no less that one had won the ecstasy of <i>jhāna</i> on the actual occasion of any sense-cognition, or at the very moment of thinking immoral thoughts, accompanied by lust, hate, delusion, or any of the ten corruptions… . </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.6.3"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If your proposition is true, it must also be true <span class="supplied"><i>a fortiori</i></span> that a series of <em>bad</em> conscious units is <i>samādhi</i>, whether it is accompanied by lust, hate, or any of the ten corruptions. This you deny… . </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.6.4"></a><span class="add">Sarvāstivādins and Uttarapāthakas:</span> But if we are wrong, did not the Exalted One say:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“I, friend Jainas, am able, without moving the body or using the voice, to spend seven nights and days in the experience of absolute bliss.”</span></p>
<p>Surely then the flow of consciousness constitutes <i>samādhi</i> of mind.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
