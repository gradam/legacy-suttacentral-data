<h1>16.6. Matter and Concomitant Moral Conditions</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc307"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That material qualities are accompanied by moral conditions.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc308"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16.6.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> That is (i.) they must be accompanied by one or more of the six motives or moral conditions, either good or bad; (ii.) they have a mental object or idea, having the properties of mental adverting, adjustment, etc. … <span class="add">See <span class="cr">Kv16.5.1</span>–<span class="cr">Kv16.5.2</span>.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16.6.2"></a>If you admit that disinterestedness, love, and the other four, as moral conditions, have a mental object and involve mental adverting, adjustment, etc., then you must describe material qualities in the same terms. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16.6.3"></a> And if that be so, you cannot deny either attribute to material qualities without equally denying it to the moral conditions.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16.6.4"></a><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas:</span> But is not matter in causal relations? You agree. Then it is surely right to say material qualities are accompanied by <span class="add">moral conditions or</span> motives.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
