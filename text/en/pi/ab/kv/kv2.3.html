<p><span class="add">Note: most of this section is omitted as it is similar to the previous.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.3.1"></a>Again, did not the Exalted One say in the Suttanta:</p>
<div class="sutta_ll"><blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“When phenomena clearly manifest<br>
To a holy one, ardent, practicing <i>jhāna</i>,<br>
Then his doubts all vanish,<br>
Since he understands phenomena and their causes.</p>
<p>“When phenomena clearly manifest<br>
To a holy one, ardent, practicing <i>jhāna</i>,<br>
Then his doubts all vanish,<br>
Since he truly knows the ending of conditions.</p>
<p>“When phenomena clearly manifest<br>
To a holy one, ardent, practicing <i>jhāna</i>,<br>
He stands, dispelling Māra’s army,<br>
Like the sun lighting up the sky.”</p>
</blockquote></div>
<div class="sutta_ll"><blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Whatever doubts, regarding this life or the next,<br>
To experienced by oneself or experienced by another,<br>
One practicing <i>jhāna</i> abandons them all,<br>
Ardently living the spiritual life.”</p></blockquote></div>
<div class="sutta_ll"><blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="pc" id="pc119"></a>“Those who, surrounded by doubters<br>
Beings overcome by doubt,<br>
Are without doubt, released,<br>
What is given to them bears great fruit.</p>
<p>“Since this teaching is so clearly explained,<br>
How could a disciple have any doubts?<br>
Homage to the Buddha who has crossed the flood<br>
And severed every doubt, victor, the people’s lord!”</p></blockquote></div>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
