<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.307</a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That material qualities are moral conditions.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv16.5.1</a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Your view implies that (i.) material qualities must act as one or other of the sis motives of moral or immoral conduct; (ii.) they have a mental object or idea, having the properties of mental adverting, adjustment, etc. From both of these implications you dissent, hence you cannot maintain your position.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv16.5.2</a><a class="pts-cs">Kv16.5.3</a>Indeed, you are ready to maintain the contrary of (ii.), that proposition being quite true when applied to the six moral conditions, but untrue of material qualities.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv16.5.4</a><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas:</span> But are not the four primary qualities conditions of the secondary material qualities that are derived from them? Of course you assent. Hence, the four being material, material qualities are conditions <span class="supplied">however you understand “conditions”</span>.</p>
