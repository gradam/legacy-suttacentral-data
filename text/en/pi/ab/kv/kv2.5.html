<h1>2.5. Of Articulate Utterance <span class="add">During Jhāna</span></h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc120"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That there is articulate utterance on the part of one who has entered into <i>jhāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.1"></a>You affirm this <span class="add">in general</span>. Your statement should hold good for such an one everywhere, always, for all such persons, and for all such attainments in ecstatic meditation. But you do not admit all such cases. Then you cannot affirm it at all.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.2"></a>Does such an one make utterance by bodily movements? You deny that he does so, but why not, if your thesis is true? If he make no bodily expression, you should not affirm that he makes vocal expression.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.3"></a>If one during <i>jhāna</i> having <span class="add">the power of</span> speech, gives vocal expression, it follows that, having a body, he may also make bodily expression.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.4"></a>You affirm that, knowing the fact of Suffering, he utters the word “Sorrow,” yet you deny that, knowing the fact of Cause <span class="add">of Suffering</span>, he utters the word “Cause.” But why? Why, again, deny that he, knowing the facts of “Cessation” <span class="add">of Suffering</span>, and “Path” <span class="add">leading to that Cessation</span>, utters those words?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.5"></a>Or, taken negatively, why deny that he utters any of the last three terms, yet not deny that he utters the first?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.6"></a>You say that the object of such an one’s insight is the <span class="add">Ariyan</span> truth. But you deny that the object of<a class="pc" id="pc121"></a> such an one’s ear is truth. This, you say, is sound. But you deny that the object of his insight is sound.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.7"></a>No, you say, the truth is the object of his insight, sound the object of his ear. But if his insight has the truth as its object, and his ear has sound as its object, then, good sir, you should not affirm that such an one mates articulate utterance.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.7a"></a>If you say, that while his insight is concerned with the <span class="add">first</span> truth and his ear with the sound, the attainer makes articulate utterance, you must admit a combination of two contacts, two feelings, two perceptions, two volitions, two consciousnesses <span class="add">at a given moment</span>, (which is absurd).</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.8"></a>You affirm your thesis, yet you deny that it applies to one who has attained <i>jhāna</i> by any one of the eight artifices, to wit, earth, water, fire, or air; blue-green, yellow, red, or white colour, or by <span class="add">any of the four immaterial conceptual inductions, to wit,</span> infinity of space or of consciousness, “nothingness,” or “neither perception nor non-perception.” How is this intelligible? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.9"></a> If you deny each of these possibilities, you cannot affirm your proposition.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.10"></a>You deny, further, that one who practises <i>jhāna</i> for merely mundane objects makes articulate expression, whether he attain any of the four stages. Neither then can you affirm your proposition. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.11"></a> If you deny the former, you must deny the latter.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.12"></a>You affirm your proposition only of one attaining the first supramundane <i>jhāna</i>, not the second, third, or fourth. But if you affirm it of the first stage, what is there to make you deny it of the other three stages?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.14"></a><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Is it wrong to say that there is articulate utterance on the part of one who has entered <i>jhāna</i>?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One that initial<a class="pc" id="pc122"></a> and sustained application of mind was vocal activity? And does not such application belong to one in first <i>jhāna</i>? Surely then my proposition is true.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.15"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Granting that you quote correctly, and that one in first <i>jhāna</i> is engaged in such application, I say, you have just denied that anyone attaining <i>jhāna</i> by any of the eight artifices does make articulate utterance. How then can you also affirm your proposition?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.16"></a><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One that speech arises from initial application <span class="add">or directing</span> of thought? And does not such movement of thought belong to one in first <i>jhāna</i>?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.17"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> That is no good reason. The Exalted One also said that speech is caused by perception. Now one in second, third, or fourth <i>jhāna</i> has perception, but <span class="add">we know that</span> he no longer applies or sustains thought. So also for the four more abstract <i>jhāna</i> states (see <span class="cr">Kv2.5.8</span>).</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.18"></a>Moreover, is it not said in the Suttanta:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“In one who has entered first <i>jhāna</i> speech has ceased.”</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.19"></a>If you maintain your proposition in the teeth of this one, you must cease to hold <span class="add">in accordance with the next words</span> in the Suttanta: that </p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“In one who has entered second <i>jhāna</i>, thought initial and sustained has ceased.” </span></p>
<p>Similarly you must contradict the remaining words: </p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“In one who has entered third <i>jhāna</i>, zest has ceased;  in one who has entered fourth <i>jhāna</i>, respiration has ceased; in one who has entered the sphere of infinite space, perception of bodily qualities has ceased; in one who has entered the sphere of infinite consciousness, perception of space infinity has ceased;<a class="pc" id="pc123"></a> in one who has entered the sphere of nothingness, perception of infinity of consciousness, ceased; in one who has entered the sphere wherein is neither perception nor non-perception, preception of nothingness has ceased; in one who has entered the cessation of perception and feeling, both perception and feeling have ceased.”</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.20"></a><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> But if my proposition is wrong, why did the Exalted One say that <span class="sutta_ll">“for first <i>jhāna</i> sound is a thorn”</span>? Does not this show that one who has attained <i>jhāna</i> can emit speech?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.21"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> You accept both the Suttanta dictum and your proposition. But, by the same Sutta, that which is eliminated successively, as each further stage of <i>jhāna</i> is reached, was pronounced to be a thorn in its turn. Does that therefore indicate that one who attained each stage, practised each obstacle to that stage?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.5.22"></a><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> But did not the Exalted One say in the Suttanta:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">Ānanda, Abhibhūto, disciple of Sikhin, the Exalted One, Arahant Buddha Supreme, standing in the Brahma-world, lifted up his voice over ten thousand worlds, saying: </span>
</p><div class="sutta_ll"><blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Arise and strive! go forth and give<br>
Yourselves unto the Buddha’s Rule!<br>
Sweep ye away the hosts of Death<br>
As elephant a rush-built shed.<br>
Who in this Dhamma and Discipline<br>
Earnest and zealous shall abide,<br>
Casting away the round of births,<br>
He shall make utter end of Suffering”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Surely then an attainer does utter articulate sounds during ecstasy.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
