<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<h1>18.7. Of Jhāna and its Intervals</h1>
</div>


<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.329</a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That there is an intermediate stage between the First and Second Stages.</p>

<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.330</a><a class="pts-cs">Kv18.7.1</a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But this is to imply intervening stages between contact or feeling, or perception… .</p>

<p>Again, why deny intermediate stages between Second and Third, or Third and Fourth <i>jhāna</i>? If you deny them here, you must deny them between First and Second <i>jhāna</i>. <a class="pts-cs">Kv18.7.3</a> You cannot maintain the intermediate stages between First and Second <i>jhāna</i> only, <a class="pts-cs">Kv18.7.4</a> denying the existence of such stages between the others.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv18.7.5</a>You say that <i>samādhi</i> of mind accompanied by sustained thought only, without its initial application, constitutes the intermediate stage. But why make an exception in this way? Or why not include the other two forms, accompanied by both or by neither? <a class="pts-cs">Kv18.7.6</a> If you deny that <i>samādhi</i> with or without initial and sustained application of thought is a <i>jhānic</i> interval, why not deny it in the case of <i>samādhi</i> without initial application, but with sustentation of thought?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv18.7.7</a>You maintain that in the interval between the manifestation of two stages of <i>jhāna</i> there is <i>samādhi</i> in sustained thought only, without initial application of thought. But while such <i>samādhi</i> is proceeding, is not the first <i>jhāna</i> at an end and the second <i>jhāna</i> manifested? You assent, but you contradict thus your proposition.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv18.7.8</a><span class="add">Sammitīyas and Andhakas:</span> If we are wrong, does <i>samādhi</i> in sustained thought only, without initial application of thought, constitute any one of the Four <i>jhāna</i>s? You say, no. Then it must constitute an interim state—which is what we affirm.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv18.7.9</a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But did not the Exalted One declare three forms of <i>samādhi</i>, namely, in both applied and sustained thought, in the latter only, and where there is neither? If so, you cannot single out the second form of <i>samādhi</i> as a state intermediate between <i>jhāna</i>s.</p>
