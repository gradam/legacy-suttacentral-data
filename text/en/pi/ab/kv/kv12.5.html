<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<h1>12.5. Of the Seven-Rebirths’-Limit.</h1>
</div>


<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.268</a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That he who is said to be liable to seven more rebirths at most is assured of final salvation only at the end of the seven-rebirths” interval.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv12.5.1</a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is such an one capable of murdering mother, father, or Arahant, of shedding with malign heart a Tathāgata’s blood, of creating schism? You deny… . </p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv12.5.2</a>And is he incapable of penetrating Truth during the interval? You deny. Then he cannot possibly become guilty of those heinous crimes, which admit of no intervening rebirth without retribution. You now assent, admitting that he is incapable of that penetration. Then you imply that he may commit those crimes, which of such a man you deny.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv12.5.3</a>Is there a fixed order of things (among the Paths) by which the seven-rebirths’-limit man is bound to go through all the seven? You deny. Then your proposition cannot hold. Do you in other words hold that there are applications of mindfulness, supreme efforts, steps to potency, controlling powers, forces, factors of enlightenment, by <span class="supplied">culture in</span> which the seven-births’-limit person is destined to go through all seven?</p>

<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.269</a><a class="pts-cs">Kv12.5.4</a> Is not the opposite the case? And how then can you maintain your proposition?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv12.5.5</a>You maintain that such a person is not so destined except by the fixed order of the First, or Stream-winner’s Path. But are all who enter on that Path destined to go through all the seven rebirths?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv12.5.6</a><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas:</span> You say I am wrong; nevertheless you must admit that the person in question is a seven-births’-limit person? Surely then my proposition stands?… </p>
