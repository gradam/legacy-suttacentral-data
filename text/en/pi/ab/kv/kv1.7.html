<h1>1.7. Of what does my “Past” Consist?</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc98"></a> <span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That one’s past consists in <span class="supplied">bodily and mental</span> aggregates.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.7.1"></a><span class="add">Opponent:</span> If you affirm that <span class="supplied">my</span> past consisted in aggregates—as you do—you must also admit that the past <em>exists</em>—which you deny. This is also the position in the case of the organs and objects of sense, the elements, or all of the three taken together. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.7.2"></a> Again, if you admit that <span class="supplied">my</span> future will consist in aggregates—as you do—you must also admit that the future exists—which you deny.</p>
<p>This is also the position in the case of the organs and objects of sense, the elements, or all of the three taken together.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.7.3"></a>If you admit—as you do—that <span class="supplied">my</span> present consists in aggregates and that it exists, you must also admit that<a class="pc" id="pc99"></a> my past, which consisted in aggregates, exists. Similarly for other present factors of experience. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.7.4"></a> Similarly, again, for my future.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.7.5"></a>Again, if you admit a past consisting in aggregates—or other factors, such as sense-organs, etc.—which does not <span class="supplied">now</span> exist, you must admit that the present consisting (as you agree) in aggregates, etc., no longer exists. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.7.6"></a> Similarly as to a future consisting in aggregates, etc., but not existent.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.7.7"></a>Again, a little more specifically, if you admit that material qualities in the past formed my aggregates, sense-organs and objects, elements, or all of these together, then you must also admit that past material qualities exist.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.7.8"></a>And if you admit that material qualities in the future will form my aggregates, etc., you must also admit that future material qualities exist.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.7.9"></a>Again, if you admit that material qualities in the present form my bodily aggregate and the other factors, and that the present exists, you must also admit that my past material qualities, having consisted in bodily aggregate, etc., exist.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.7.10"></a>The same reasoning holds good, if, for “past”, “future” material quality be substituted.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.7.11"></a>Again, if you admit past material qualities existing as an aggregate, and hold the view that those past qualities do not exist, then you must admit that present material qualities existing as an aggregate, and other present factors, do not exist.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.7.12"></a>Similarly as to future material qualities existing as an aggregate, and other future factors, held by you to be non-existent.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.7.13"></a>This also holds good if, for “material qualities,” any of the four <em>mental</em> aggregates be substituted. For instance, if you admit that consciousness in the past formed my aggregate, sense-organs and objects, or elements <span class="supplied">all of which you would call real</span>, then you must also admit that past consciousness exists. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.7.14"></a> Similarly, if you admit that future consciousness will form my aggregate,<a class="pc" id="pc100"></a> etc., you must also admit that future consciousness exists. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.7.15"></a> Again, if you admit that present consciousness forms my aggregate, with other factors, and that the present exists, you must also admit that my past consciousness, consisting in aggregate, sense-organ, and the rest, exists. So again for future consciousness.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.7.17"></a>Once more, if you declare, of past consciousness existing as an aggregate, and the rest, that that consciousness does not exist, then you must admit that present consciousness, existing as an aggregate, does not exist.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.7.18"></a>Similarly as to future consciousness.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.7.19"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is it then wrong to say that my past and my future consisting in aggregates, elements, sense-organs and objects, do not exist?</p>
<p><span class="add">Opponent:</span> Yes</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“These three modes in word, in term, or in name, <i>bhikkhus</i>, which are, and were, formerly held distinct, are not mixed, will not be confused, are not condemned by recluses and brahmins who are wise: which three? (1) Those aggregates, material and mental, which are past, have ceased, are changed, are reckoned, termed, named ‘have been’;  they are not reckoned as ‘are’ (or ‘exist’), nor yet as ‘will be’. Similarly, (2) for those aggregates that ‘will be,’ and (3) for those that ‘are’.”</span></p>
<p>Is the Suttanta thus? Then it should surely be said that my past and future consisting in aggregates, elements, sense-organs and objects, exist.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.7.20"></a><span class="add">Opponent:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p> 
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Whatsoever material qualities, <i>bhikkhus</i>, whether past, future, or present, are either internal or external, gross or subtle common or excellent, distant or near, are called the material aggregate. Whatsoever feeling, or other mental aggregate, whether past, etc. …”</span></p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc101"></a>Is the Suttanta thus?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Opponent:</span> Hence it should certainly not be said that “my past and future consisting in aggregates,” etc., do not exist.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
