<h1>8.4. Of Sense-Desires</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc215"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> Whether the subjective sense-desires or the objective five fields of sense constitute <i>kāma</i>’s.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc216"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.4.1"></a> is <em>verbatim</em> = <span class="cr">8.3.1</span> in viii. 3, and <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.4.2"></a> is <em>verbatim</em>=<span class="cr">Kv8.3.5</span> save for the substitution of “Hence sensuality consists in only the five fields of sense-object.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.4.3"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But was it not also said by the Exalted One:</p>
<div class="sutta_ll">
<p>“There are these fivefold pleasures of sense, <i>bhikkhus</i>: which are the five? Objects desirable, … adapted to sense-desires (<i>kāma</i>), and seductive are cognizable by sight, hearing, etc. … five kinds of <span class="add">objects associated with</span> sense-pleasure. Nevertheless, <i>bhikkhus</i>, these are not sense-desires; they are called in the Ariyan discipline <span class="add">objects of</span> sense-pleasures (<span class="add">kāmaguṇa</span>). For <i>kāma</i> is a man’s lustful intention.</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“The manifold of objects in the world—<br>
This in itself is not ‘desires of sense.’<br>
Lustful intention is man’s sense-desires.<br>
That manifold of objects doth endure;<br>
The will thereto the wise exterminate”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Hence it is wrong to say that just the five kinds of senseobjects constitute sense-desires.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
