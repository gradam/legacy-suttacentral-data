<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<h1>12.8. Of Murder</h1>
</div>


<p><a class="pc" id="pc269"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That a person who has attained to sound views may yet designedly commit murder.</p>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc270"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs12.8.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then you imply that he may designedly commit <span class="supplied">any murder, even the worst, to wit</span> matricide, parricide, Arahanticide, or with enmity at heart may wound a Tathāgata, or create schism in the Saṅgha… . </p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs12.8.2"></a>You imply, moreover, that <span class="supplied">since he may commit such a deed</span> he can have no reverence for Master, Doctrine, Saṅgha, or Training, <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs12.8.3"></a> while you know, on the other hand, that such a person feels just the opposite.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs12.8.4"></a>You imply, moreover, that such a person may defile Buddha shrines, desecrate them, spit on them, behave as an infidel in presence of them? </p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs12.8.5"></a>But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Just as the ocean, <i>bhikkhus</i>, remains of the same nature, and passes not beyond the shore, just so is the body of precepts which I have established for those who are hearers of my word, and which they their lives long do not pass beyond.”</span></p>

<p>Hence it is not right to say that a person who has attained to sound views may designedly deprive a living creature of life.</p>
