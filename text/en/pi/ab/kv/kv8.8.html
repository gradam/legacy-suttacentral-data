<h1>8.8. Of the Senses in the Rūpa-Sphere</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc220"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That there is matter among the Immaterial.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.8.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.8.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is then “matter” (<i>rūpa</i>) a sphere of life, a destiny, a realm of beings, renewed life, a matrix, an acquiring of individuality? This you deny; but all this you can predicate truly of Arūpa. Hence you cannot maintain your proposition.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.8.2"></a>You cannot predicate them truly of a five-mode existence, one mode of which is material qualities. But you can do so respecting a four-mode existence, that is, with the material qualities omitted, as is the case with Arūpa… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.8.3"></a>You can predicate them truly of the Rūpa-sphere, where there yet is matter. But this sphere is not identical with the Arūpa-sphere. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.8.4"></a> And if you predicate matter of the Arūpa-sphere, you must show that matter agrees with the description you can truly give of the Arūpasphere as a state of existence, a destiny, etc.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.8.5"></a>Again, did not the Exalted One say that the Arūpa was a way of escape from visible or material things? If that is true, do you still maintain your proposition? Yes? Well, then, the Exalted One said that renunciation was a way of escape from sense-desires. Now, according to your reasoning (if there is matter in the Immaterial), there are sense-desires in renunciation, and there are defilements in<a class="pc" id="pc221"></a> those who are freed from them, there are things included” (in intoxicant-infested states of the three spheres) among the “unincluded” which is absurd.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
