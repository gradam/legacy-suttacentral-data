<h1>15.2. Of Reciprocal Correlation</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc294"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That whereas actions are conditioned by ignorance, we may not stay that ignorance is conditioned by actions.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc295"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.2.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But is not ignorance coexistent with action? If so, here is a reciprocal correlation <span class="add">namely, of coexistence</span>.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.2.2"></a>Again, “grasping is conditioned by craving.” Now, is it wrong to say that craving is conditioned by grasping? Yes, you say. But the argument above is valid here also.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.2.3"></a><span class="add">Mahāsaṅghikas:</span>  <span class="sutta_ll">“Birth, <i>bhikkhus</i>, is conditioned by decay and death, the tendency to become is conditioned by birth.”</span></p>
<p>Is the Suttanta thus?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> No.</p>
<p><span class="add">Mahāsaṅghikas:</span> Neither is the reciprocal conditioning correlation between ignorance and activities reciprocal, nor that between craving and grasping.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.2.4"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span>  <span class="sutta_ll">“Mind and body, <i>bhikkhus</i>, are conditioned by rebirth-consciousness, and this by mind and body.”</span></p>
<p>Is the Suttanta thus?</p>
<p><span class="add">Mahāsaṅghikas:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then the conditioning relation may be reciprocal.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
