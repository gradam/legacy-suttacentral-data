<h1>10.6. Of Two Codes of Morals</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc248"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That one who is engaged in the Path is practising a double morality.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10.6.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> You must then be prepared to affirm that he is possessed of his dual morality with a dual mental contact, dual feeling, dual perception, dual volition, dual thought, dual faith, dual energy, dual mindfulness, dual <i>samādhi</i>, dual understanding… . <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10.6.2"></a> If his moral code be worldly, those processes will be worldly. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10.6.3"></a> If his moral code be both, they will be double. The mental contact, the feeling, etc., that he experiences, will be both worldly as well as unworldly <span class="supplied">or supramundane</span>-which you of course deny… .</p>
<p>And if you say that one actually engaged on the Path is possessed of a worldly code of morals, you are calling such an one in effect an average person or worldling—which you of course refuse to do… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10.6.4"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10.6.6"></a>Your position, you say, is this: (1) one actually engaged on the Path practises a worldly morality in the three factors relating to conduct—right speech, right action, right livelihood-but not in the five factors relating to mental life. (2) In those three factors his morals are both worldly and supramundane, but they are only the latter in the other five factors. My position is that you must affirm one and the same higher morality for all the eight.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc249"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10.6.7"></a> <span class="add">Mahāsaṅghikas:</span> Well, but does the Path come to be when worldly morality has ceased? </p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Mahāsaṅghikas:</span> What! can anyone without morals—his virtue defective, imperfect, cut off—develop the Path?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> No, that cannot truly be said… . </p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
