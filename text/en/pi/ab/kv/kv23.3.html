<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<h1>23.3. Of Self-governed Destiny</h1>

<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.366</a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That a Bodhisatta (or future Buddha) (a), goes to an evil doom, (b) enters a womb, (c) performs hard tasks, (d) works penance under alien teachers of his own accord and free will.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv23.3.1</a>(a) <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you mean that he so went and endured purgatory, the Sañjīva, Kālasutta, Tāpana, Mahātāpana, Saṅghātaka, Roruva, and Avīci hells? If you deny, how can you maintain your proposition? Can you quote me a Sutta to support this?</p> 

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv23.3.2</a>(b) You maintain that he entered the womb of his own free will. Do you also imply that he chose to be reborn in purgatory, or as an animal? That he possessed<a class="pts-vp-en">PC.367</a> magic potency? You deny. I ask it again. You assent. Then did he practise the Four Steps to that potency—will, effort, thought, investigation? Neither can you quote me here a Sutta in justification.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv23.3.3</a>(c) You maintain further that the Bodhisatta of his own free will performed that which was painful and hard to do. Do you thereby mean that he fell back on wrong views such as “the world is eternal,” etc., or “the world is finite,” etc., or “infinite,” etc.,” soul and body are the same,’… “are different,” “the Tathāgata exists after death, “does not exist,” “both so exists and does not” “neither so exists nor does not”? Can you quote me a Sutta in justification?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv23.3.4</a>(d) You maintain further that the Bodhisatta of his own free will made a series of penances following alien teachers. Does this imply that he then held their views? Can you quote me a Sutta in justification?… </p>
