<h1>6.3. Of the Four Truths</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc188"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the Four Truths are unconditioned.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.3.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you then also admit <span class="supplied">not one, but</span> four <i>Nibbāna</i>s? For if you do, is there among these four a boundary, division, line or interstice, different degrees as to loftiness, excellence or sublimity?… </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.3.2"></a>You affirm, do you not, that each Truth is unconditioned. Take the first Truth on <span class="supplied">the fact and nature of</span> Suffering: is Suffering itself unconditioned? You deny—that is, you mean that bodily suffering, mental suffering, grief, lamentation, melancholy or despair is conditioned? Or the second Truth on the cause of Suffering—is that cause unconditioned? You deny… . Then you must equally deny that desires of sense, desire for <span class="supplied">after-</span>life, or desire to end life, is unconditioned? Or the fourth Truth of the Path to Cessation of<a class="pc" id="pc189"></a> Suffering—is the Path itself unconditioned? You deny… . Then you do not mean that right views, right intentions… right <i>samādhi</i> are unconditioned?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.3.3"></a>You admit then that Suffering, its Cause, the Path are conditioned, and all the factors of those facts are conditioned, but deny that the <span class="supplied">abstract</span> statement of each fact as a “Truth” is conditioned—which cannot be… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.3.4"></a>Take now the Third Truth on the Cessation of Suffering—is Cessation unconditioned? “Yes,” you say? Why then, if the First Truth is unconditioned, is not Suffering unconditioned? Or the Cause? Or the Path? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.3.5"></a> In all but the Third Truth, you maintain that the true thing is conditioned—why not in the Third?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.3.6"></a><span class="add">Pubbaseliyas:</span> But if I am wrong, why was it said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“These four things, <i>bhikkhus</i>, are stable, constant, immutable. Which are the four? “This is Suffering!”—this, <i>bhikkhus</i>, is stable, constant, immutable. “This is the cause of Suffering… the Cessation of Suffering… the course leading to the Cessation of Suffering!”—this, <i>bhikkhus</i>, is stable, constant, immutable. These are the four.”</span></p>
<p>Surely then the Four Truths are unconditioned.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
