<h1>13.9. Of the Unmorality of a Natural Desire for Objects of the Mind	</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc279"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That to crave for objects of the mind is unmoral.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc280"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.9.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If that be so, this craving must belong to one of the moral indeterminates—to wit, resultant or inoperative indeterminates—matter, <i>Nibbāna</i>, or the organs and objects of the five senses. But you must deny this <span class="add">as not doctrinal</span>.</p>
<p>Or what reason have you for dissociating this sixth form of <i>taṇhā</i> (<span class="add">natural desire or craving</span>) from the rest? If you admit that a craving for objects of sight, sound, and so on is immoral, you must admit as much concerning the co-ordination of these.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.9.2"></a>Did not the Exalted One call craving immoral? Does not this condemn your proposition? Did he not call appetite (or greed) immoral? and is not craving for objects of the mind a kind of greed?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.9.3"></a>Your contention is that a craving for objects of the mind is an unmoral appetite, but you are not justified in using greed with this qualification, when in the other five modes of sense it is called immoral.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.9.4"></a>Again, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“This natural desire is concerned with rebirth, is accompanied by delight and lust, dallying here and there—to wit, desires of sense, desire for rebirth, desire not to live again”? … </span></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.9.5"></a><span class="add">Pubbaseliyas:</span> But if I am wrong, is not this <span class="add">threefold</span> craving a craving for certain ideas or mental objects? </p>
<p>Hence surely such a craving is as such immoral.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
