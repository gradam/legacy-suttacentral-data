<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv8.1.1</a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Did not the Exalted One name five destinies—purgatory, the animal kingdom, the Peta-realm, mankind, the devas? <a class="pts-cs">Kv8.1.2</a> And did not the Kalakañjaka Asuras, who resembled the Petas in <span class="supplied">ugly or frightful</span> shape, sex-life, diet, and length of life, intermarry with them? <a class="pts-cs">Kv8.1.3</a> And did not Vepacitti’s troop, who in the same respects resembled the devas, intermarry with devas? <a class="pts-cs">Kv8.1.4</a> And had not Vepacitti’s troop been formerly devas?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv8.1.5</a><span class="add">Andhakas and Uttarapāthakas:</span> But since there is an Asura-group, it is surely right to speak of it as a <span class="supplied">possible</span> destiny?</p>
