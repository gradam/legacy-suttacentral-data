<p><a class="pc" id="pc230"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the Fetters are put off for one who discerns a blessing (in store).</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.1.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But are not the Fetters also put off when the world is considered as impermanent? You admit this, of course. But <span class="supplied">then you should not confine yourself to the optimistic side</span>.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.1.2"></a>You admit, too, they are put off when the world is considered as full of Suffering, as disease, as a canker, a piercing dart, as woe, as unbearable, as an enemy, as crumbling away, as a calamity, as oppression, as peril, as trouble, as fluctuating, as dissolving, as transient, as shelterless, as no retreat, as no refuge, as without protection, as empty, bare and void, as without soul, as full of danger, and mutable. <span class="supplied">But your statement hereby becomes one-sided.</span></p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc231"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.1.3"></a> You admit then that (at the same moment) a man can both consider the impermanence and so on of the world, and see the blessings in <i>Nibbāna</i>? No? But you have admitted that he loses the Fetters when he does both. You admit then that he can? But does this not involve us in two simultaneous mental reactions, two consciousnesses, and so on?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.1.4"></a><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> You reject my proposition. But did not the Exalted One say:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Take, <i>bhikkhus</i>, the case of a bhikkhu who lives contemplating the happiness in <i>Nibbāna</i>, perceiving and feeling that happiness continually, constantly, and undiluted, convinced of it in his mind and permeated with it by insight?… </span></p>
<p>Surely then it is for one who discerns the happy prospect that the Fetters are put off.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
