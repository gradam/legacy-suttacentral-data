<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<h1>7.3. Of Menial Properties</h1>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc197"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That they do not exist.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.3.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> You surely do not also deny that some mental phenomena are concomitant, co-existent, conjoined with consciousness, have their genesis and cessation, physical basis and object in common with it? Why then exclude the “mental?” <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.3.2"></a> Contact, for instance, is co-existent with consciousness; hence it is a “mental,” i.e., a property or concomitant of mind. So are feeling, perception, volition, faith, energy, mindfulness, <i>samādhi</i>, understanding, lust, hate, delusion, … indiscretion—all the “mentals.”</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.3.3"></a><span class="add">Rājagirikas and Siddhatthikas:</span> You allow then that what is co-existent with consciousness is a “mental.” Do you equally admit that what is co-existent with contact is a “contactal,” or that what is co-existent with each of those mental phenomena is to be analogously regarded;  for instance, that what is co-existent with indiscretion is an “indiscretional”?</p>

<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Certainly. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.3.4"></a> And if you assert that there are no mental phenomena corresponding to our term “mentals”, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<div class="sutta_ll"><blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“This mind and mental phenomena<br>
Are not-self for one who understands.<br>
One who discerns the inferior and superior in both,<br>
The seer, he knows that they are of the nature to disintegrate.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc198"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.3.5"></a> Or again, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Suppose in this case, Kevatta, that a <i>bhikkhu</i> can make manifest the mind, and the mental <span class="supplied">property</span>, and the direction and application of thought in other beings, other individuals, saying: Such is your mind. This is your mind. Thus and thus are you, conscious.”</span></p>

<p>Hence there is such a thing as a “mental” <span class="supplied">that is, a property, or concomitant, of conciousness or mind</span> .</p>
