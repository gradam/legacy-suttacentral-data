<h1>20.1. Of Unintentional Crime</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc343"></a> <span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the five cardinal crimes, even when unintentionally committed, involve retribution immediately after death.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.1.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But you imply that if I accidentally take away life, I am a murderer, <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.1.2"></a> and <span class="add">similarly as to two of the other four wicked deeds forbidden by morality</span> that if I accidentally take what is not given, I am a thief… if I utter untruths unintentionally, I am a liar. You deny. Yet you wish to make exceptions <span class="add">to the relative innocence of such acts</span> in just those five serious cases… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.1.3"></a>Can you cite me a Sutta judging unintentional crime like that which says: </p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“He that intentionally takes his mother s life incurs immediate retribution.”</span>  </p>
<p>You cannot. Neither can you maintain your proposition.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.1.4"></a><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas:</span> But does not the fact remain that the mother’s life is taken? Surely then the unintentional slayer also incurs immediate retribution. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.1.5"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.1.7"></a> Similarly, too, does<a class="pc" id="pc344"></a> one who unintentionally kills father or Arahant, or sheds a Buddha’s blood, incur a like doom.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.1.8"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> <span class="add">Now as to the fifth of such crimes</span>: do you imply that all schismatics incur such a doom? You deny. But think again! You now assent. But does a schismatic” who is conscious of right incur it? You deny. But think again! You now assent. But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">There is a kind of schismatic, Upali, who incurs disaster, purgatory, misery for an won, who is incurable;  there is a kind of schismatic, Upali, who does not incur such a doom, who is not incurable.”</span></p>
<p>Hence it is not right to say that a schismatic who perceives Dhamma incurs such a doom.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.1.9"></a><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<div class="sutta_ll"><blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“He who breaks up the Saṅgha<br>
Is doomed to remain for an aeon <br>
In states of suffering and woe.<br>
He who delights in a separate group,<br>
And adheres not to the Dhamma, <br>
Destroys the security from bondage.<br>
Having broken up the Saṅgha when it was in harmony<br>
He is tormented for an aeon in hell.</p></blockquote></div>
<p>Hence surely a schismatic incurs retribution immediately after death.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
