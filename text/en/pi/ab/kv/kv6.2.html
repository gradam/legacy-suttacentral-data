<h1>6.2. Of Causal Genesis</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc186"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the causal elements in the law of causal genesis are unconditioned.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.2.1"></a>This is exactly similar to the opening argument in <span class="cr">Kv6.2.1</span>.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc187"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.2.2"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.2.3"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Would you say that any single term in each clause of the formula of causal genesis refers to something unconditioned, for instance, “ignorance,” or “karma,” in the clause “because of ignorance, karma,” etc.? No? Then how can you maintain your thesis?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.2.4"></a><span class="add">Pubbaseliyas and Mahīsāsakas:</span>  If we are wrong, why did the Exalted One say as follows:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“‘Because of birth, <i>bhikkhus</i>, comes decay and death’: whether Tathāgatas arise or not, this element stands as the establishing of things as effects, as the marking out of things as effects, as the cause of this or that. Concerning this element a Tathāgata becomes enlightened, and penetrates it. Thus enlightened and penetrating, he declares, teaches, makes known, lays it known, reveals, dispenses, makes manifest, and behold! he says: ‘Because of birth, <i>bhikkhus</i>, comes decay and death.’ ‘Because of the tendency to become comes birth. Because of… ’ and so on, back to: ‘Because of ignorance comes karma.’ Thus, <i>bhikkhus</i>, this element, stable, constant, immutable, is called a causal term <span class="supplied">in the law of causal genesis</span>.”</span></p>
<p>Surely then the causal element in that law is unconditioned.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.2.5"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span>  In the clause “Because of ignorance karma,” the former is that which establishes, which marks out the latter as its effect. And <i>Nibbāna</i> is unconditioned—you affirm both of these? Yes? Then are there two unconditioned?… two shelters… (as in <span class="cr">Kv6.2.1</span>)?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.2.6"></a>And if in the next clause: “Because of karma, consciousness,”<a class="pc" id="pc188"></a> you affirm that karma is unconditioned, are there then three unconditioneds?… </p>
 <p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.2.7"></a>And so on, affirming that each of the remaining nine terms and <i>Nibbāna</i> are unconditioned: are there then twelve unconditioneds?… twelve shelters, twelve refuges, etc.?</p>
<p>Of course you deny, hence you cannot affirm that the causal term in the law of causal genesis is unconditioned.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
