<h1>9.3. Of Matter as Subjective</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc233"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> Whether matter should be termed subjective or objective.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.3.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If that is so, you must also affirm of matter or body, that it has the mental features of “adverting,” ideating, reflecting, co-ordinated application, attending, willing, anticipating, aiming—things which you would, on the contrary, deny of matter.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.3.2"></a>All, or any of them you can rightly affirm of mental properties, such as contact (mental reaction), feeling, perception, volition, cognition, faith, energy, mindfulness, <i>samādhi</i>, understanding, lust, hate, illusion, conceit,<a class="pc" id="pc234"></a> erroneous opinion, doubt, mental inertia, distraction, immodesty, indiscretion—all of which you admit as subjective. But matter is not one of these, and therefore such things may not be affirmed of it.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.3.3"></a>You deny in the case of matter all those mental features—adverting, etc.—but claim for it the term “subjective,” which is really applicable to “contact,” sensation, etc. These, as you admit, do not lack those mental features named.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.3.4"></a><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas:</span> But is not matter correlated (as an object)? Of course you assent. Then as correlated it is surely right to apply the term “subjective” to matter, etc. <span class="supplied">since “object” is one of the twenty-four (causal) relations</span>.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
