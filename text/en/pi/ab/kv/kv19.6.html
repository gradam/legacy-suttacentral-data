<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<h1>19.6. Of <i>Nibbāna</i> as Morally Good</h1>
</div>


<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.339</a> <span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the element (or sphere) of <i>Nibbāna</i> is good.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv19.6.1</a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you imply that it has a mental object, involving a mental process of adverting, reflecting, coordinating, attending, willing, desiring, aiming? Is not rather the opposite true?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv19.6.2</a>These things we can predicate of all morally good mental states—of disinterestedness, love, intelligence, faith, energy, mindfulness, <i>samādhi</i>, understanding. But if we cannot predicate them of <i>Nibbāna</i>, then is the element of <i>Nibbāna</i> not rightly called morally good.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv19.6.3</a><span class="add">Andhakas:</span> But is not the element of <i>Nibbāna</i> faultless? If so—and you do assent—then it, not being immoral, is moral.</p>
