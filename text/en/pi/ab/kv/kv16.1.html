<h1>16.1. Of Control</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc303"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That one can control the mind of another.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16.1.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you mean that one can bid the consciousness of another not to lust, not to hate, not to be bewildered, not to be corrupted? Of course you deny. But how then can you maintain your view? Or do you mean that one can bid any mental phase uprisen in another’s consciousness—reaction, feeling, perception, volition… understanding—to cease? Equally you deny… . <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16.1.2"></a> Or do you mean that anyone puts away lust, hate, or any evil mental coefficient on account of another? Or practises the <span class="add">Ariyan</span> Path, or applications in mindfulness, or any other set of the factors of enlightenment because of another? Or masters the Four Truths—understanding Suffering, putting away its Cause, realizing its Cessation, practising the Path thereto—because of another? Or finally, do you mean that anyone makes another the doer of his actions, that anyone’s happiness and suffering are wrought by another, that one acts while another experiences? If you deny, you must deny your own view.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc304"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16.1.3"></a> And was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<div class="sutta_ll"><blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“By oneself is bad done,<br>
By onself is one defiled;<br>
By oneself is bad not done,<br>
By oneself is one purified;<br>
Purity and impurity are individual,<br>
No-one is able to purify another.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Hence it is surely wrong to say that one can control the mind of another.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16.1.4"></a><span class="add">Mahāsaṅghikas:</span> But have not some admittedly won power and authority? Surely this includes control over others” minds.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
