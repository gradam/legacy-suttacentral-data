<h1>6.1. Of Assurance <span class="supplied">of salvation</span></h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc185"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That “Assurance” is unconditioned.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.1.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then is Assurance <span class="supplied">that other unconditioned called</span> <i>Nibbāna</i>, or the Shelter, the Cave, the Refuge, the Goal, the Past-Decease, the Deathless? You deny. Yet you would call both alike unconditioned. Are there then two kinds of unconditioned? If you deny, you cannot affirm; if you assent, then <span class="supplied">for all we know</span> there are two Shelters… two Goals… two <i>Nibbāna</i>s. If you deny, you cannot affirm your proposition; if you assent, then do # you allow that of the two <i>Nibbāna</i>s one is higher than the other, sublimer than the other, exalted more than the other? Is there a boundary, or a division, or a line, or an interstice between them? Of course you deny… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.1.2"></a>Again, are there any who enter into and attain Assurance, cause it to arise, to keep arising, set it up, continue to set it up, bring it to pass, to come into being, produce it, continue to produce it? “Of course,” you say.<a class="pc" id="pc186"></a> But are these terms that you can apply to what is unconditioned? Of course not… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.1.3"></a>Again, is the Path (the Fourfold) “unconditioned? “No,” you say, “conditioned.” Yet you would make Assurance unconditioned; the Path of Stream-Winning, Once-Returning, Never-Returning, Arahantship, conditioned; but Assurance of Stream-Winning, etc., unconditioned!… </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.1.4"></a>If then these four stages of Assurance be unconditioned, and <i>Nibbāna</i> be unconditioned, are there five kinds of the unconditioned? If you assent, you are in the same difficulty as before <span class="cr">Kv6.1.1</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.1.5"></a>Finally, is false Assurance unconditioned? “No, conditioned,” you say. But has true Assurance the same quality? Here you must deny… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.1.6"></a><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> If I am wrong, would you say that, if Assurance having arisen for anyone and ceased, his work of making sure <span class="supplied">his salvation</span> would be cancelled?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> No.</p>
<p><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> Then Assurance must be unconditioned <span class="supplied">that is, it cannot begin and cease</span>.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span>  But your argument can be applied to false Assurance. You would not therefore call that unconditioned!</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
