<h1>5.9. Of Knowledge of the Present</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc183"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the present may be known.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.9.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If there be a knowledge of the present, does one know that knowledge by the same act of knowledge? If you deny, your proposition must fall. If you assent, I ask: Does one know <em>that</em> he knows the present by that same act of knowledge? You deny, and your previous assertion falls. If you assent, I ask: Is the conscious act of knowing the object of the knowledge? You deny, and your previous assertion falls. If you assent, then you imply that one touches contact by the contact, feels feeling by that feeling, wills volition by that volition. So for the initial and the sustained application of thought. So for zest, for mindfulness, for understanding. You imply that one cuts a sword with that sword;  an axe with that axe;  a knife with that knife;  an adze with that adze;  that one sews a needle with that needle;  handles the tip of a finger with that finger;  kisses the tip of the nose with that nose; handles the head with that head;  washes off impurity with that impurity.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.9.2"></a><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> I am wrong then? But when all things are seen as impermanent, is not that knowledge also seen as impermanent? Surely then I am right.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
