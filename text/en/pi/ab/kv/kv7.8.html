<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.8.3"></a>Again, you admit, do you not, that the decay and dying of bad states of mind is the result of previous bad states? But then you must also admit that the decay and dying of good states of mind is the result of previous good<a class="pc" id="pc208"></a> states—which you deny… . But in denying the latter, you imply denial of the former statement… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.8.4"></a>Or do you hold that the decay and dying of good states of mind is the result of previous bad states? You do, you say. Then you imply that the decay and dying of bad states is the result of previous good states—which you deny… . But in denying this, you imply denial of the former statement… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.8.5"></a>Or do you affirm that the decay and dying of both good and bad states of mind are the result of bad states? You do, you say. Then you must say no less: “is the result of good states’—which you deny… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.8.6"></a><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> You say my proposition is false. But surely acts conduce to the deterioration and to the curtailment of life? If so, my proposition is true.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
