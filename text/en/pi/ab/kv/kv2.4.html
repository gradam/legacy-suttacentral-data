<h1>2.4. Of the Arahant being excelled by Others</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc119"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the Arahant is excelled by others.</p>
<p>(a) <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.4.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> You maintain that he is. Then you must also admit that the Arahant is led by others, attains through others, is conditioned by others, exists in dependence upon others, and knows not sees not, being baffled and without thoughtfulness. If you deny this, you cannot affirm that he is excelled by others, etc. …</p>
<p>(b) <em>The argument in</em> 2, <span class="cr">Kv2.4.4</span>, <span class="cr">Kv2.4.5</span>, <em>is omitted</em>.</p>
<p>(c) <em>To the five quoted Sutta passages in</em> 2, <span class="cr">Kv2.4.17</span>–<span class="cr">2.4.21</span>, <em>a sixth is added</em>: </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.4.20"></a>Again, did not the Exalted One say in the Suttanta:</p>
<div class="sutta_ll"><blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Dhotaka, I am unable to free<br>
Anyone in the world who has doubts.<br>
Directly understanding this excellent teaching,<br>
Thus you will cross over this flood.”</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
