<h1>3.3. Of Emancipation</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc144"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That “becoming emancipated” has reference to the heart being <span class="add">at the time</span> in touch with lust, etc</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.3.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> You affirm this. Then you must equally affirm that “becoming emancipated” refers to a heart which is accompanied by, co-existent with, mixed with, associated with, has developed with, goes about with, lust; to a heart, again, which is immoral, worldly, in touch with defilements, allied with fetters, ties, floods, bonds, hindrances, is infected, allied with grasping, corrupt—which you refuse to do.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.3.2"></a>If the heart or mind which is in contact be emancipated, are both contact and mind emancipated? “Yes” you say. But then you must equally affirm that, if the heart which is in touch with lust be emancipated, both lust and heart are emancipated—which you refuse to do.</p>
<p>The same reasoning holds good not only of contact, but also of <span class="add">the other properties of the mind</span>—feeling, perception, volition, … reason, or understanding.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc145"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.3.3"></a> Once more, if mind which is in contact, and in touch with lust, be emancipated, are both contact and mind emancipated? Yes, you say. But then you must equally affirm that both lust and mind are emancipated—which you refuse to do.</p>
<p>The same reasoning holds good of the other properties of the mind.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.3.4"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.3.6"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.3.7"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.3.9"></a><span class="add"><em>The same argument is then applied to “emancipation” referred to “hate,” and to “delusion’—the other two of the fundamental conditions of evil doing</em>.</span> </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.3.10"></a><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> You say that we are wrong in affirming that a mind full of lust, hate and delusion undergoes emancipation. But your denial that a mind which is devoid of all three undergoes emancipation rather confirms our view.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
