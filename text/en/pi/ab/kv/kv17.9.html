<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<h1>17.9. Of the Saṅgha and the Fruit of Giving</h1>
</div>


<p><a class="pc" id="pc320"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That it should not be said that “a thing given to the Saṅgha brings great reward.”</p>


<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.9.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.9.2"></a><em>Similar to</em> <span class="cr">Kv16.6.1</span> <span class="cr">Kc.16.6.2</span>.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.9.3"></a>And was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Give, lady of the Gotamas, to the Saṅgha. In that giving you shall also honour to me and to the Saṅgha.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.9.4"></a>Again, was it not said to the Exalted One by Sakka, ruler of the gods:</p>
<div class="sutta_ll"><blockquote class="gatha">
<p> “For people who make sacrifices,<br>
For creatures who seek merit,<br>
Makers of auspicious healing merit:<br>
Where is a gift of great fruit?”</p>
<p>“The four who practise in the Paths,<br>
The four established in the Fruits—<br>
Such is the Saṅgha upright, true,<br>
Endowed with wisdom and virtue.</p>
<p>“For people who make sacrifices,<br>
For creatures who seek merit,<br>
Makers of auspicious healing merit:<br>
In the Saṅgha a gift is of great fruit.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="sutta_ll"><blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“This Saṅgha is indeed abundant and grown great,<br>
Measureless as the waters of the oceans,<br>
These are indeed the best, the disciples of the Hero of Mankind,<br>
Bringers of light, proclaiming the Dhamma.</p>
<p>“The gifts given in dedication to the Saṅgha<br>
Are well-given, well-offered, well-sacrificed.<br>
Those offerings, established in the Saṅgha,<br>
Are of great fruit, praised by the Knower of Worlds.</p>
<p>Such as these, people who delight in sacrifice,<br>
Uplifted with joy they live in the world<br>
Having dispelled the stain of stinginess with its root,<br>
Blameless, they go to a heavenly place.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>Hence surely a thing given to the Saṅgha brings great reward.</p>
