<h1>9.2. Of the Deathless as an Object by which we are bound</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc231"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the Deathless as an object of thought is a “fetter.”</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc232"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.2.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If you say that, are you prepared to admit that the Deathless is the object of consciousness accompanied by “Fetters,” “Ties,” “Floods,” “Bonds,” “Hindrances,” “Infections,” “Graspings,” “Corruptions”? Is it not rather an object accompanied by the very opposite?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.2.2"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.2.4"></a>You affirm that, on account of the Deathless occupying the mind, lust, hate, ignorance may spring up. But are you prepared to admit that the Deathless itself conduces to occasions for lusting, to lusting after, wishing for, being inebriated, and captivated by, languishing for? That it conduces to occasions for hatred, anger, and resentment? That it conduces to occasions for delusion, for depriving of knowledge, for blinding vision, for suspending insight, for siding with trouble, for failing to win <i>Nibbāna</i>? Is it not rather the opposite of all these? How then can you say that, on account of the Deathless occupying the mind, lust, hate, and ignorance spring up? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.2.5"></a> All these things you may truly predicate as springing up because of the occupation of the mind with material qualities (<i>rūpa</i>). But material qualities are not the Deathless.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.2.6"></a>You would not say that, whereas the Fetters spring up because of material qualities, the latter do <em>not</em> conduce to Fetters, Ties, Floods, and all such spiritual defects and dangers. How then can you affirm just the same of the Deathless: that, whereas the Fetters spring up because of it, it does not conduce to Fetters, and so forth? Or that, whereas lust, hate, and ignorance spring up because of the Deathless, nevertheless the Deathless is not an occasion for lusting and all the rest?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.2.7"></a><span class="add">Pubbaseliyas:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“He perceives <i>Nibbāna</i> as such, and having perceived it he imagines things about <i>Nibbāna</i>, with respect to <i>Nibbāna</i>, <a class="pc" id="pc233"></a> things as <i>Nibbāna</i>, that ‘<i>Nibbāna</i> is mine,’ dallying with the idea.”</span></p>
<p>Therefore the Deathless is an object of thought not yet freed from bondage.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
