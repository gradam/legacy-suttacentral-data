<h1>18.2. Of how the Dhamma was taught</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc324"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That it is not right to say “The Exalted Buddha himself taught the Dhamma.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18.2.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> By whom then was it taught?</p>
<p><span class="add">Vetulyakas:</span> By the special creation (<i>abhinimmita</i>).</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span>  Then must this created thing have been the Conqueror, the Master, the Buddha Supreme, the Omniscient,<a class="pc" id="pc325"></a> All-seeing, Lord of all things, Judge of Appeal of all things!… </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18.2.2"></a>I ask again: By whom was the Dhamma taught?</p>
<p><span class="add">Vetulyakas:</span> By the venerable Ānanda.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then must he too have been the Conqueror, the Master, etc. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18.2.3"></a> But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Sāriputta, I may teach the Dhamma concisely and I may teach it in detail, and I may teach it both ways. It is only they who understand that are hard to find.”</span></p>
<p>Hence surely the Buddha himself taught the Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18.2.4"></a>And again, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“By the higher knowledge, <i>bhikkhus</i>, do I teach the Dhamma, not without the higher knowledge; a Dhamma with <span class="supplied">reference to</span> cause do I teach, not one without; a to wonder-working Dhamma do I teach, and none not wonder-working. And that I, <i>bhikkhus</i>, thus teach the Dhamma, a homily should be made, instruction should be given, to wit, let this, <i>bhikkhus</i>, suffice for your content, let this suffice for your satisfaction and for your gladness: the Exalted One is Buddha Supreme! The Dhamma is well revealed! The Saṅgha is well trained! Now when this declaration was uttered, ten thousand world-systems trembled.”</span></p>
<p>Hence surely the Exalted Buddha himself taught the Dhamma.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
