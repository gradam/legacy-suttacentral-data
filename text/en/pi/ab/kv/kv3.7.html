<h1>3.7. Of the “Celestial Eye.”</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc149"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the fleshly eye, when it is the medium of an idea, becomes the celestial eye.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc150"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.7.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If you affirm this, you must also say that the fleshly eye is the celestial eye, and conversely, that the two are like in kind, are, in fact, identical, the one having the same range, power, and field as the other. This you deny.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.7.2"></a>Again, if you make the two thus on a par, you are affirming that something grasped at <span class="add">as effect by previous karma</span> becomes something not so grasped at, that experience in the universe of sense is experience in the universe of “Rūpa,” that experience, analogously reasoning, in the universe of Rūpa is experience in the universe of the remoter heavens, that the things included in these universes are “the <em>Unincluded</em>’—which is absurd.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.7.3"></a>Further, you are, by your proposition, also admitting that the celestial eye, when it is the medium of a sensuous idea <span class="add">in <i>jhāna</i></span>, becomes the fleshly eye. And, again, that, when it is the medium of a <span class="add">spiritual</span> idea, it then becomes the eye of understanding—which you must deny.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.7.4"></a>Further, you are also admitting that there are only two kinds of vision (or “eye ”). If you deny, your proposition falls. If you assent, I would ask whether the Exalted One did not speak of three kinds of vision—the fleshly, the celestial, and the eye of understanding, thus:</p>
<div class="sutta_ll">
<p>“Three, <i>bhikkhus</i>, are the modes of sight—which are they? The fleshly eye, the celestial eye, the eye of understanding.
</p><blockquote class="gatha">
<p> “The eye of flesh, the heavenly eye,<br>
And insight’s eye, vision supreme:<br>
These are the eyes, the visions three<br>
Revealed by the man supreme.</p>
<p>“The genesis of fleshly eye,<br>
The way of eye celestial,<br>
How intuition took its rise:<br>
The eye of insight unsurpassed.<br>
Whoso doth come that eye to know,<br>
Is from all suffering and sorrow freed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
