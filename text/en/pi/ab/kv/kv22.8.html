<p><a class="pc" id="pc363"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That all things are momentary conscious units.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs22.8.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you imply that a mountain, the ocean, Sineru chief of mountains, the cohesive, fiery, and mobile elements, grass, twigs, trees, all last <span class="supplied">only so long</span> in consciousness? You deny… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs22.8.2"></a>Or do you imply that the organ of sight coincides for the same moment of time with the visual cognition? If you assent, I would remind you of what the venerable Sāriputta said:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“If, brother, the eye within is intact, but the object without does not come into focus, and there is no coordinated application of mind resulting therefrom, then a corresponding state of cognition is not manifested. And if the<a class="pc" id="pc364"></a> organ of sight within is intact, and the object without come into focus? but no co-ordinated application of mind result therefrom, a corresponding state of cognition is not manifested. But if all these conditions be satisfied, then a corresponding state of cognition is manifested.”</span></p>
<p>Where now is your assertion about coincidence in time?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs22.8.3"></a>The same Suttanta reference may be cited to refute you with respect to time-coincidence in the other four senses.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs22.8.4"></a><span class="add">Pubbaseliyas and the Aparaseliyas:</span> But are all things permanent, enduring, perduring, immutable?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> No that cannot truly be said… .</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
