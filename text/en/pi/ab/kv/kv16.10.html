<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<h1>16.10. Of Desire for Life in the Higher Heavens</h1>

<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.310</a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That lust for life in Rūpa or Arūpa spheres is included among the data thereof</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv16.10.1</a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> <span class="add"><em>Similar</em> to <span class="cr">Kv16.9.1</span>.</span> </p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv16.10.2</a>And you cannot maintain your view without admitting that a corresponding lust for the objects of hearing, smelling,<a class="pts-vp-en">PC.311</a> taste and touch is one of the data in the sphere of each of these respectively.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv16.10.3</a>If you cannot affirm the latter, you cannot make an exception of the former.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv16.10.4</a>Next with regard to (ii.) lust for life on the Arūpa <span class="supplied">immaterial</span> plane as a datum thereof—my first argument used above (<span class="cr">Kv16.9</span>) holds good. <a class="pts-cs">Kv16.10.5</a><a class="pts-cs">Kv16.10.6</a>. So does my second used above (<span class="cr">Kv16.10.2</span>). If your proposition is to stand, then a desire for each sense-object must be among the elemental data of the sphere of that particular object. You cannot make an exception of the desire for life in the immaterial sphere.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv16.10.7</a><span class="add">Andhakas:</span> But is not desire for life in the plane of sense <span class="supplied">kāmadhātu</span> among the elemental data of that plane?Then surely you cannot make an exception as to desire for life in the Rūpa and Arūpa spheres?</p>
