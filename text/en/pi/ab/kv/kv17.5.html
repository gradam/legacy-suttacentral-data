<h1>17.5. Of “save only the Ariyan Path”</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc317"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That save only the Ariyan Path, all other conditioned things may be called “Suffering”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.5.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then you call the Cause of Suffering also Suffering? If you deny, you cannot maintain your proposition. If you assent, do you mean that there are but three Truths? If you deny, your proposition falls. If you assent, do you not contradict the words of the Exalted One, that the Truths are four—Suffering, Cause of Suffering, Cessation of Suffering, Way going to the Cessation of Suffering?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.5.2"></a>If now you admit that the Cause of Suffering is also Suffering, in what sense do you judge it to be so?</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc318"></a><span class="add">Hetuvādins:</span> In the sense of impermanence.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But the Ariyan Path, is that impermanent?</p>
<p><span class="add">Hetuvādins:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then is not that also Suffering?… </p>
<p>You say then that the Path is impermanent but not Suffering, while the Cause of Suffering is both impermanent and Suffering. <span class="add">It is impossible for you to maintain such a position</span>… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.5.3"></a><span class="add">Hetuvādins:</span> But if the Path be “a way going to the cessation of Suffering,” I maintain that, when we speak of all other conditioned things as Suffering, this Ariyan Path is excepted.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
