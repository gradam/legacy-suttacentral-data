<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<h1>3.5. Of the Eighth Man</h1>
</div>


<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.146</a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That for the person in the Eighth Stage, outbursts of wrong views and of doubt are put away.</p>

<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.147</a><a class="pts-cs">Kv3.5.1</a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Are you then also prepared to admit that the eighth man is a Stream-Winner, one who has won, obtained, arrived at, and realized the Fruit of Stream-Winning, and that, having achieved, he lives in personal contact therewith? <a class="pts-cs">Kv3.5.2</a> <a class="pts-cs">Kv3.5.3</a> Are you further prepared to admit that he has put away the latent bias of doubt and wrong views? And if these, then also the infection of mere rule and ritual? For your proposition involves all this. <a class="pts-cs">Kv3.5.4</a> Conversely, if you deny that these are put away by him, you must also deny that he has put away wrong views and doubt.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv3.5.5</a>How should he have already put away wrong views and doubt when he has not yet practised the Path wherein they get put away? And not only the Path (the Eightfold), but all the other factors of Enlightenment?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv3.5.6</a>For if he have not put away wrong views and doubt by the Path, or the other factors, he can surely not have put them away by means that is not the Path, but is worldly, co-intoxicant, etc. … and corrupt.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv3.5.7</a><a class="pts-cs">Kv3.5.8</a><span class="add">Andhakas and Sammitīyas:</span> Since you deny that a person of the eighth rank has put away the <span class="supplied">overt</span> outburst of wrong views and of doubt, I ask you, will these arise any more in him?</p>

<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> They will not.</p>

<p><span class="add">Andhakas and Sammitīyas:</span> Surely then our proposition is true: they <em>are</em> put away.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv3.5.9</a><a class="pts-cs">Kv3.5.10</a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Assuming that the outbursts will not again arise <span class="supplied">i.e., become manifest in action</span>, you say they are put away. But is the latent bias of wrong opinions, doubt, and belief in mere rule and ritual equally put away simply because these do not arise? And this you are not prepared to admit.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv3.5.11</a>Once more, you claim that the eighth man has put away wrong views and doubt. But you must then allow<a class="pts-vp-en">PC.148</a> that one who has reached the stage in <i>jhāna</i>-meditation of “adoption” has put them away, and in this you do not concur.</p>
