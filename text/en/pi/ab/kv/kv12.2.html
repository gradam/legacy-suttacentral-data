<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.265</a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That all action (karma) entails moral result (<i>vipāka</i>).</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv12.2.1</a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you imply that all volition entails result <span class="supplied">volition being moral action</span>? If you deny, then your proposition is not universally valid. If you do imply that volition entails result, then you are committed to this—that volition which is indeterminate as to moral result entails moral result; that volition which is inoperative and<a class="pts-vp-en">PC.266</a> therefore indeterminate as to moral result entails such result, whether such volition be exercised in any one of the three spheres of life, or in that which is not included in them… . All of this you must deny… . <a class="pts-cs">Kv12.2.2</a> For do you not hold that resultant or inoperative volition, which is indeterminate as to moral result, cannot be said to entail result? Where then is your universal proposition?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv12.2.3</a><span class="add">Mahāsaṅghikas:</span> But if I am wrong, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“I declare, <i>bhikkhus</i>, that there can be no annulment of voluntary deeds done and accumulated, without experience of the results thereof, be it in this life or in the after-life.”</span></p>	

<p>Wherefore all action surely entails result.</p>
