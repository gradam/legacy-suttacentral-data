<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.368</a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the aggregates, elements, controlling powers—all save Suffering, is undetermined.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv23.5.1</a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you then maintain that <span class="supplied">the marks of the conditioned are lacking in, say, the material aggregate—that</span> matter is not impermanent, not conditioned, has not arisen because of something, is not liable to decay, to perish to be devoid of passion, to cessation, to change? Is not the opposite true?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv23.5.2</a>Do you imply that only Suffering is caused? Yes? But did not the Exalted One say that whatever was impermanent was Suffering? Hence, if this be so, and since matter is impermanent, you cannot maintain that only Suffering is determined.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv23.5.3</a>The same argument holds good for the other four aggregates (mental), for all the mechanism of sense, for all controlling powers. </p>
