<h1>7.9. Of the Ariyan Mind and its Results</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc208"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That Ariyan states of mind have no <span class="supplied">positive</span> result.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.9.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.9.2"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But you admit that the career of a recluse or religious student is productive of great rewards—to wit, the fruits of the Four Paths. How then can you deny positive result?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.9.3"></a>Or, if you deny that these four kinds of fruit are positive result—as you do—then you equally deny that<a class="pc" id="pc209"></a> there is positive result in the fruit of giving or of moral conduct, or of religious exercises, which you maintain… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.9.4"></a>Now in maintaining these propositions, you must no less maintain that there is positive result in the fruits of the Paths… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.9.5"></a>Again, you will of course admit that good done in relation to life on earth or in the heavens, material or immaterial, entails result. Does this not commit you to admitting that good done in relation to path-graduating also entails result <span class="supplied">though you deny this by your proposition</span>? Conversely, if you maintain that good done in relation to path-graduating entails no result, must you not also deny result to good done in relation to life on earth or in heaven?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.9.6"></a><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> <span class="supplied">Well, but is not this a parallel case?</span> You will of course admit that good done in relation to life on earth or in the heavens, material or immaterial, entailing result, makes for accumulation of rebirth. Does this not commit you to admitting that good done in relation to path-graduating, entailing <span class="supplied">as you say</span> result, makes also for accumulation of rebirth <span class="supplied">though you of course deny this</span>?</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
