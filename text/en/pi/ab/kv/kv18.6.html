<h1>18.6. Of the Transition from One <i>jhāna</i> to Another</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc327"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That we pass from one <i>jhāna</i> to another <span class="supplied">immediately</span>.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc328"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18.6.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Does this imply that one can pass over from First to Third, from Second to Fourth <i>jhāna</i>? You deny <span class="supplied">setting an arbitrary limit</span>… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18.6.2"></a>Or take only a passing over from First <i>jhāna</i> attainment to that of Second—which you affirm to be possible—you are implying that the mental process—adverting, reflecting, co-ordinating, attending, willing, wishing, aiming—called up for First <i>jhāna</i> is the same as that required for Second <i>jhāna</i>. But you dissent. Do you mean that no <span class="supplied">preliminary</span> mental process of adverting, etc., is required for Second <i>jhāna</i>? On the contrary, you agree that Second <i>jhāna</i> arises after a certain mental process—adverting, etc. Therefore one does not pass over directly from First <i>jhāna</i> to the next.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18.6.3"></a><span class="supplied">Again, take the objects and characteristics of First <i>jhāna</i>.</span> The First Stage, you admit, may come to pass while one is considering the harmfulness of sense-desires; moreover, it is accompanied by application and sustentation of thought. But neither that object nor these characteristics, you must admit, belong to the Second Stage. Yet your proposition really commits you to asserting identity between First and Second <i>jhāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18.6.4"></a>The same argument applies to transition from Second to Third <i>jhāna</i>. </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18.6.5"></a> <span class="supplied">Again, take the specific objects and characteristics of the Second Stage: </span> the Second Stage, you admit, may come to pass while one is considering the harmfulness of application and sustentation of thought;  moreover, it is accompanied by zest. But neither that object nor these characteristics, you must admit, belong to the Third Stage. Yet your proposition really commits you<a class="pc" id="pc329"></a> to an assertion of identity between Second and Third Thana.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18.6.6"></a>The same argument applies to transition from Third to Fourth <i>jhāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18.6.7"></a> <span class="supplied">Again, take the specific objects and characteristics of the Third Stage: </span> the Third Stage, you admit, may come to pass while one is considering the harmfulness of zest; moreover, it is accompanied by happiness. But neither that object nor these characteristics, you must admit, belong to the Fourth Stage. Yet your proposition really commits you to an assertion of identity between Third and Fourth <i>jhāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18.6.8"></a><span class="add">Mahīsāsakas and Andhakas:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Here, <i>bhikkhus</i>, when a <i>bhikkhu</i>, aloof from sense-desires, etc. attains to and abides in First… Fourth <i>jhāna</i>.”</span></p>
<p>According to that <span class="supplied">formula</span> one does pass over immediately from <i>jhāna</i> to <i>jhāna</i>.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
