<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18.9.2"></a>Again, you are implying that the eye can “advert” or reflect, co-ordinate, will, etc., albeit you agree that the contrary is true.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc333"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18.9.3"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18.9.4"></a> .These arguments hold good for similar claims put forward by you for the other four senses.</p>

<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Here, <i>bhikkhus</i>, a <i>bhikkhu</i> sees objects with the eye, hears sounds, and so on.”</span></p>
<p>Hence surely we see visible objects with the eye and so on.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
