<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<h1>3.12. Of <span class="supplied">the Plane</span> Where Consciousness Neither Is Nor Is Not</h1>
</div>


<p><a class="pc" id="pc155"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That it is wrong to say that, in the plane wherein consciousness neither is nor is not, there is consciousness.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.12.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But you would not describe that plane as one of life, destiny, habitation of beings, continued existence, birth, acquired personality that is unconscious? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.12.2"></a> Nor as a life, etc., of one constituent only? Would you not call it a life of four constituents?</p>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc156"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.12.3"></a> If we deny consciousness among the Unconscious Beings, and call that sphere a life, destiny … personality without consciousness, how can you deny consciousness to this plane where consciousness neither is nor is not, without describing it in the same terms? Or how can we speak of that sphere as a life of a single organic constituent without describing this plane in the same terms? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.12.4"></a> If your proposition be right, and yet you describe this plane as conscious life, etc., then similarly, in refusing consciousness to the Unconscious sphere, you must describe that sphere as conscious life, etc., which is absurd. So also for the fourfold organic life. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.12.5"></a> For if you deny consciousness to this plane, and yet call it a life of four <span class="supplied">mental</span> constituents, then your proposition obviously falls through.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.12.6"></a>You grant me that this plane, wherein consciousness neither is nor is not, is a life of four constituents, saying the while that there is no consciousness in this plane—you allow, do you not, that in the <span class="supplied">lower</span> plane called “infinity of space” there is consciousness? And that there is consciousness in the <span class="supplied">next higher</span> planes: “infinity of consciousness,” and “nothingness.” Why not then for our <span class="supplied">fourth and highest</span> plane? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.12.7"></a> How can you admit consciousness for those three and not for this, while you allow that each is a life of four <span class="supplied">mental</span> constituents?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.12.8"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.12.10"></a>Do you object to this: in this plane consciousness either is or is not? Yes? but why, when, you admit the co-presence of those four constituents? Why, again, when you admit them in the case of the other three planes, and allow that there, too, consciousness either is or is not?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.12.11"></a>You admit that the plane in question is that wherein is neither consciousness nor unconsciousness, and yet you maintain that it is wrong to say: in that plane consciousness neither is nor is not! <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.12.12"></a> But take neutral feeling—is it wrong to say that neutral feeling is either feeling or not feeling? “Yes,” you admit, “that cannot truly be said.” Then how can the other be said?</p>
