<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.297</a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the decay and death of spiritual things is itself spiritual.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv15.6.1</a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then you must be prepared to classify it with one of the <span class="supplied">approved</span> spiritual things—Path, Fruit, <i>Nibbāna</i>, etc… , For instance, is the decay and death of the Stream-Winner’s Path the Path itself? If you deny, your proposition falls through. If you assent, you<a class="pts-vp-en">PC.298</a> must also apply your proposition to all the other stages, and say, finally, that the decay and death of the fruit of arahantship is itself fruit of arahantship—which you may not. Nor will you be prepared to admit decay and death as identical with any one of the Factors of Enlightenment.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv15.6.2</a><span class="add">Mahāsaṅghikas:</span> Then, is the decay and death of supramundane things a mundane thing? You deny. Then it must be supramundane.</p>
