<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<h1>14.5. Of Latent Bias as Something Apart</h1>
</div>


<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.287</a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That latent bias, in any of the seven forms, is different in kind from a patent outbreak of the vice.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv14.5.1</a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you equally maintain that the lusts of sense are different in kind from the lusts of sense openly manifested? You deny, but you cannot then maintain your proposition. You cannot maintain that the lusts of sense are the same as those lusts manifested, and yet deny<a class="pts-vp-en">PC.288</a> the identity in the case of the manifesting of them and the latent bias.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv14.5.2</a><a class="pts-cs">Kv14.5.7</a>This argument holds good for the other six forms—enmity, conceit, erroneous opinion, doubt, lust of life, ignorance.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv14.5.8</a>Andhakas—But if I am wrong, may not an average worldly man, while thinking what is good or unmoral, be said to have latent bias, but not to be openly manifesting any of its forms?</p>

<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If you conclude from this that your proposition is right, you must equally admit that, whereas such a person may also be said to have lust, though he be not openly manifesting it, lust is different in kind from open manifestation of it.</p>
