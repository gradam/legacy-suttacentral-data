<h1>11.4. Of the Utterance,” This is Pain and Sorrow!”</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc257"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That from utterance of the word, “This is Suffering!” insight into the nature of Suffering is set working.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.4.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But you deny that a similar result ensues on the utterance of the other three Truths: This is the Cause, this the Cessation, this the Path leading to the Cessation of Suffering. Why is this? </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.4.2"></a> Why deny for these what you affirm for the first Truth?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.4.3"></a>Or why deny, as you do, that insight into the impermanence of each of the five aggregates (body-mind) follows from statement of the fact? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.4.4"></a> Or, once more,<a class="pc" id="pc258"></a> that insight into the soullessness of each aggregate follows from a statement of the fact? </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.4.5"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.4.6"></a> On what grounds can you defend the sequence in one case only out of the three sets of five propositions?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.4.7"></a>Now do you mean to tell me that insight issues from every syllable of this formula: This-is-pain-and-sor-row?</p>
<p><span class="add">Andhakas:</span> No, that cannot truly be said… .</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
