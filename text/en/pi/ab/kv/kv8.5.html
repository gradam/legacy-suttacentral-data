<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<h1>8.5. Of the Rūpa-element</h1>
</div>


<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.217</a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the ultimate “datum or element of <i>rūpa</i>” is things <span class="supplied">cognized as</span> material.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv8.5.1</a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is then <i>rūpa</i> a sphere of life, a destiny, a realm of beings, renewed life, a matrix, a station for rebirth-consciousness, an acquiring of individuality? Is there karma leading to it, beings to be reborn in it? Do they get born, grow old, die, decease, get rebirth there? Are the five aggregates “in” <i>rūpa</i>? Is it a five-mode existence? <a class="pts-cs">Kv8.5.2</a> Now all these you can predicate of the Rūpa-datum, but not of <i>rūpa</i>., or material quality. Hence the latter has not all that is implicated in the former.</p>

<p>Again, if the <i>Rūpa</i>-datum consists only of material qualities—and, as you will admit, there is material quality in the <i>kāma</i>-datum—is this latter datum the same as <i>Rūpa</i>-datum? You say “no.” But think. <em>You</em> must admit it is. Then we get a man in two life-spheres at the same time… . </p>
