<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<h1>7.10. Of Results as again causing Results</h1>
</div>


<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.209</a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That “result” is itself a state entailing resultant states.</p>

<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.210</a><a class="pts-cs">Kv7.10.1</a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If your proposition is true it is tantamount, to saying that the result of that <span class="supplied">result</span> entails <span class="supplied">other</span> results—which you deny… . Or, if you assent, then you are asserting that in a given series there is no making an end of suffering, no cutting off the round of birth and death no <i>Nibbāna</i> without residual stuff of life—which is contrary to doctrine.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv7.10.2</a>Again, are you asserting that “result” and “state entailing resultant states “are identical, equivalent terms—of one import, the same, of the same content and origin?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv7.10.3</a>That they are concomitant, co-existent, conjoined, connected, one in genesis, in cessation, in basis, and in mental object? All this you deny… .</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv7.10.4</a>Again, do you mean that a given bad mental state is its own result, a given good state its own result? That the consciousness with which we take life is the very consciousness with which we burn in purgatory? That the consciousness with which we give a gift of merit is the very consciousness with which we rejoice in heaven?… </p>	

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv7.10.5</a><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> You deny my proposition;  but are not “results, <span class="supplied">of karma</span>” the four immaterial aggregates in reciprocal relation? If so, surely it is right to say that a result is. a mental state resulting from other mental states?</p>
