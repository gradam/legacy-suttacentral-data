<h1>5.7. Of the Mental Object in Telepathy</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc180"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That insight into the thoughts of another has no object beyond bare other-consciousness as such.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc181"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.7.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> You admit, do you not, that one may discern a “lust-ridden consciousness,” and so on as such? Then this disposes of your proposition.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.7.2"></a>Again, you cannot deny that, in thought-discerning, insight can have as its object contact, feeling, etc. <span class="add">or any of the concomitants of consciousness</span>. Where then is bare consciousness as sole object?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.7.3"></a>Or do you dispute the statement that insight having contact, or feeling, or the rest as its object, comes into thought-discerning? “Yes” you say? But does not thought-discerning include discerning the course of contact, feeling, etc.? This you now deny.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.7.4"></a><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> You say my proposition is wrong. But is not this thought-discerning insight limited to a portion of the course of thought <span class="add">in others</span>? Then surely I am right.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
