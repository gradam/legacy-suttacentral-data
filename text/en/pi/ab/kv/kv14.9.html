<p><a class="pc" id="pc292"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14.9.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then you must be prepared to class them among the category of the “Unincluded,” to wit, as Path, Fruit, <i>Nibbāna</i>, as one of the Four Paths, or Four Fruits, as one of the Factors of Enlightenment—which you may not do.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14.9.2"></a><span class="add">Pubbaseliyas:</span> But if I am wrong, why do you admit that a worldly person <span class="supplied">in <i>jhāna</i></span> may be called passionless as to sense-desires, but deny: that he has lost all erroneous opinion?</p>
<p>Surely then it is right to say that erroneous opinion may enter into “the Unincluded.”</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
