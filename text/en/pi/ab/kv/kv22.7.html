<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.362</a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That there is no correlation by way of repetition.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv22.7.1</a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>

<p><span class="sutta_ll">“The taking of life, <i>bhikkhus</i>, when habitually practised and multiplied, is conducive to rebirth in purgatory, or among animals, or Petas. In its slightest form it results in, and is conducive to, a brief life among men.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv22.7.2</a> And again:</p>

<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Theft, <i>bhikkhus</i>, adultery, lying, slander, uttering harsh words, idle talk, intoxication, habitually practised and multiplied, are each and all conducive to rebirth in purgatory, among animals, or Petas. The slightest theft results in, conduces to destruction of property; the mildest offence against chastity gives rise to retaliatory measures among men; the lightest form of lying exposes the liar to false accusation among men; the mildest offence in slander leads to a rupture of friendship<a class="pts-vp-en">PC.363</a> among men;  the lightest result of harsh words creates sounds jarring on the human ear; the slightest result of idle talk is speech commanding no respect among men;  the mildest inebriety conduces to want of sanity among men.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv22.7.3</a><a class="pts-cs">Kv22.7.4</a> And again: </p>

<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Wrong views, <i>bhikkhus</i>, wrong aspiration, effort, speech, activity, livelihood, mindfulness, <i>samādhi</i>—each and all, if habitually practised, developed, and multiplied, conduce to rebirth in purgatory, among animals, among Petas.”</span></p>

<p>And again:</p>

<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Right views, right purpose, etc, habitually practiced, developed, and multiplied, have their base and their goal and their end in the Deathless.”</span></p>
