<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.238</a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That initial mental application “falls” on all consciousness.</p>

<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.239</a><a class="pts-cs">Kv9.7.1</a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If that is true, you must also be prepared to admit in detail that <span class="supplied">other mental properties</span> sustained application, zest, pleasure, pain, gladness, melancholy, indifference, faith, energy, mindfulness, <i>samādhi</i>, understanding, lust, hate… indiscretion fall on (or operate in) all consciousness. - But you are not so prepared… .</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv9.7.2</a><a class="pts-cs">Kv9.7.4</a>Contrariwise, is there not <i>samādhi</i> with sustained application only, not initial application; also <i>samādhi</i> wherein there is neither kind of application? Were not, in fact, three kinds of concentrative exercise distinguished by the Exalted One: (1) With both modes of application; (2) with the sustained mode only; (3) with neither?</p>

<p>Hence your proposition is wrong.</p>
