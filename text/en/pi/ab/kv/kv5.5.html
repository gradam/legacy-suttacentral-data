<h1>5.5. Of Analytic Insight</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc179"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That all knowledge is analytic.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.5.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then you must admit that popular knowledge is analytic—which you deny. For if you assent, then all who have popular, conventional knowledge, have also acquired analytic insight—which you deny. The same argument holds good if “knowledge in discerning the thought of another” be substituted for “popular… knowledge.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.5.2"></a>Again, if all knowledge is analytic, then <em>a fortiori</em> all discernment is analytic. Or, if you can assent to that, you must therewith admit that the discernment of one who attains <i>jhāna</i> by any of the elemental, or colour “artifices,” who attains any of the four more abstract <i>jhāna</i>s, who gives donations, who gives to the Saṅgha any of the four necessaries of life, is analytic. But this you deny.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.5.3"></a><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> If I am wrong, you admit that there is such a thing as <span class="add">spiritual or</span> supramundane discernment; is that not analytic?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> That I do not deny.</p>
<p><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> Then my proposition is true.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
