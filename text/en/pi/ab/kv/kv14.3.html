<h1>14.3. Of Immediate Contiguity in Sense</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc285"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That one sensation follows another as an unbroken fused sequence.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14.3.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you imply that the mental adverting, adjusting, etc., conjured up by visual consciousness is the <em>same</em> as that conjured up by auditory consciousness? Would you not affirm that this was wrong? And if wrong, do you mean that the auditory consciousness brings about no adverting or adjustment of mind? Is not the opposite true? But if it be true, then your proposition falls.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14.3.2"></a>Again, you agree that “visual consciousness” occurs to the person attending to a visible object. But you cannot urge that auditory consciousness also occurs to such an one attending to a visible object… . In other words, if visual consciousness have only visible object as its object, and nothing else, the unbrokenly succeeding auditory consciousness must have the same kind of object only and nothing else… .</p>
<p>Our doctrine says: <span class="sutta_ll">“Because of eye and visible objects visual consciousness arises.</span> Can you substitute the words<a class="pc" id="pc286"></a> “auditory consciousness”? You deny this. But I repeat the question, and ask, Is the Suttanta thus? No, you say, the former quotation was alone right. But if your proposition be right, you are implying that the given visual consciousness is none other than the given auditory consciousness.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14.3.3"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14.3.4"></a>The same argument holds whichever two of the five kinds of sense we take.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14.3.5"></a><span class="add">Uttarãpathakas:</span>  But if I am wrong <span class="supplied">consider any kind of dramatic performance</span>, when there is dancing, singing, reciting, does not the spectator see objects, hear sounds, smell odours, taste tastes, and touch tangibles? Surely then it is right to say that the five kinds of sense-cognition arise in unbroken unitary sequence.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
