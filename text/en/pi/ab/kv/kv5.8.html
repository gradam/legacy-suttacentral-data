<h1>5.8. Of Insight into the Future</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc182"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That there is knowledge of the future.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.8.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If we can know about the future <span class="add">in general</span>, it must be <span class="add">as in other knowledge</span> through knowing its root, condition, cause, source, origin, upspringing, support, basis, correlation, genesis. But you deny that we know the future thus… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.8.2"></a>And it must be <span class="add">as in other knowledge</span> through knowing how it will be correlated by condition, base, predominance, contiguity, and immediate contiguity. But You deny here again… . </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.8.3"></a>Again, if you are right, one in the stage of adoption has insight into the First Path, one in the First Path has insight into the First Fruition, and so on. But you deny here again… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.8.4"></a><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> If I am wrong, is there not a Suttanta in which the Exalted One said: “To Patna, Ānanda, three disasters will happen: by fire or by water or by rupture of friendship ”? Surely then the future may be known.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
