<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<h1>7.4. Of Giving and the Gift</h1>
</div>


<p><a class="pc" id="pc198"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That <i>dāna</i> is <span class="supplied">not the gift but</span> the mental state.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.4.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If <i>dāna</i> be a mental state, is it possible to give a mental state away to others? If you deny, your<a class="pc" id="pc199"></a> proposition falls through. If you assent, you then imply that it is possible to give any mental property to others: contact, feeling, perception, volition, faith, energy, mindfulness, <i>samādhi</i>, understanding.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.4.2"></a><span class="add">Rājagirikas and Siddhattikas:</span> If we are wrong, we ask you, is giving attended by undesirable, disagreeable, unpleasant, barren consequences? Does it induce, and result in, sorrow? Is not rather the opposite true? Surely then <i>dāna</i> is a mental state.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.4.3"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Granting that giving was pronounced by the Exalted One to produce desirable results, is giving a robe, or alms-food, or lodging, or materia medica and requisites for illness <i>dāna</i>? You admit they are, but you cannot assert that these <em>directly</em> bring about desirable, agreeable, pleasant, felicific mental results.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.4.4"></a><span class="add">Rājagirikas and Siddhattikas:</span> If we are wrong, let us quote the words of the Exalted One:</p>
<div class="sutta_ll"><blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Faith, modesty, and meritorious giving: <br>
These are the things that men of worth pursue; <br>
This, say they, is the path celestial,<br>
Hereby we pass into the deva-world.’
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.4.5"></a>Again: </p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“<i>Bhikkhus</i>, these five givings, the Great Dana’s, are supreme, secular, hereditary; ancient <span class="supplied">customs</span>, unmixed now or in the past; they are not mixed one with the other, nor shall be, and they am not despised by recluses or brahmins, or by the wise. What are the five? First, there is the Ariyan disciple who, having put away taking life, is opposed to it Such an one gives to all beings without limit security, amity, benevolence. And having thus given without limit, he himself becomes partaker in that security, amity,<a class="pc" id="pc200"></a> benevolence. Secondly, the Ariyan disciple, having put away taking what is not given, wrong conduct in sense-desires, lying, and occasions for indulging in strong drinks, is opposed to these. Thus renouncing, <i>bhikkhus</i>, he gives to all beings without limit security, amity, goodwill. And so giving, he himself becomes partaker in that unlimited security, amity, goodwill. These, <i>bhikkhus</i>, are the five Great Dana’s. “</span>

<p>If the Suttanta says thus, then giving is a mental state.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.4.6"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> According to you, then, <i>dāna</i> is not something to be given. But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Take the case of one who gives food, drink, raiment, a carriage, a wreath, a perfume, ointment, a couch, a dwelling, means of lighting.”</span> </p>

<p>Surely then <i>dāna</i> is a thing to be given.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.4.7"></a><span class="add">Rājagirikas and Siddhattikas:</span> You say then that giving is a thing to be given. Now you do not admit that the thing to be given has as its direct result something desirable, agreeable, pleasant, felicifie, a happy capacity and consequence. On the other hand, the Exalted One said that <i>dāna</i> had such a result. Now you say that a robe, alms-food, and the other requisites are <i>dāna</i>. Hence it follows that a robe and so on has such a result, which cannot be. Therefore it is wrong to say that <i>dāna</i> is a thing to be given.</p>
