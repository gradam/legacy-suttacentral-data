<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<h1>17.4. Of Suffering (Dukkha) and Sentient Organisms</h1>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc315"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That Suffering is wholly bound up with sentience.</p>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc316"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.4.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But you commit yourself to saying this: that only that which is bound up with sentience is impermanent, and conditioned, has arisen through a cause, is liable to perish, to pass away, to lose desire, to cease, to change. But are not all these terms suitable to insentient things? You assent; but you refute your proposition in so doing.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.4.2"></a>You mean, do you not, that what is not bound up with sentience is impermanent, etc., and yet is not Suffering. But if you call “what is bound up with sentience” equally impermanent, etc., must you not also say that “this is not suffering”? If you deny, <span class="supplied">and by your proposition you must deny</span>, then must you not contrariwise include “that which is not bound up with sentient life” under the notion of what” is suffering”?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.4.3"></a>Did not the Exalted One call whatever is impermanent Suffering? And is not the insentient also impermanent?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.4.4"></a><span class="add">Hetuvādins:</span>  You deny the accuracy of my proposition.<a class="pc" id="pc317"></a> But you are thereby committed to this: that just as the higher life is lived under the Exalted One for understanding Suffering as bound up with sentient life, it is also lived for the purpose of understanding Suffering that is not bound up with sentient life.</p>

<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> No, that cannot truly be said.</p>

<p><span class="add">Hetuvādins:</span> And you are further committed to this: that just as</p>

<p>Suffering that is bound up with sentient life, once it is thoroughly understood, does not again arise, neither does it again arise when it is not bound up with sentient life and is thoroughly understood.</p>

<p>You deny… but I hold my proposition stands.</p>
