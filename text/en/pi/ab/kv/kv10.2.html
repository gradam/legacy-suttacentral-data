<h1>10.2. Of the Path and Bodily Form</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc244"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the physical frame of one who is practising the Eightfold Path is included in that Path.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10.2.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> You must then be prepared to affirm also that bodily form is <span class="supplied">like the Path-factors</span> subjective, having the mental attributes of adverting, ideating, co-ordinated application, attending, volition, anticipating, aiming. You deny this and rightly, for surely the opposite is true.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10.2.2"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10.2.3"></a>The three factors of the Path <span class="supplied">in which you deem things corporeal to be included</span>—supremely right speech, action, livelihood—these, you affirm, are not subjective, not having the mental attributes above-named.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10.2.4"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10.2.5"></a> But the other five factors of the Path—supremely right views, aspiration, endeavour, mindfulness, <i>samādhi</i>—these, you admit, are subjective, and have the mental attributes above-named.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10.2.6"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10.2.7"></a>If you affirm the absence of these mental characteristics from those three factors of the Path, you must also affirm their absence from all these five factors of the Path.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10.2.8"></a><span class="add">Mahīsāsakas, Sammitīyas and Mahāsaṅghikas:</span> But you admit that supremely right<a class="pc" id="pc245"></a> speech, action, and livelihood are factors of the Path, <span class="supplied">and these are manifestations of corporeality</span>. Surely then the practiser’s physical frame is included in the Path.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
