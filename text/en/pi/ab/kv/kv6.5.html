<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.190</a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the attainment of Cessation is unconditioned.</p>

<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.191</a><a class="pts-cs">Kv6.5.1</a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Does this mean that this state is <i>Nibbāna</i>, the Shelter, etc.? You deny. Then are both similarly described as unconditioned? You affirm? Then are there two unconditioneds… two <i>Nibbāna</i>s?… </p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv6.5.2</a>Are there any who attain to Cessation, acquire it, cause it to rise, to keep rising, set up, induce, produce, bring to pass, make to be born, to happen? If so, can you so speak of the unconditioned? Of course not… .</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv6.5.3</a>Is there apparent such a thing as a purging through, emerging from, Cessation? If so, is there the same from the unconditioned? Of course not… .</p>

<p>In attaining Cessation, first speech, then action, then consciousness ceases. Can you so speak of attaining the unconditioned?</p>

<p>In emerging from Cessation, first consciousness, then action, then speech occurs. Can you so speak of emerging from the unconditioned?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv6.5.4</a>After emerging from Cessation, one is in touch with three contacts: that of the void, of the signless, of the desireless. Can you so speak of emerging from the unconditioned? Or that, when one emerges from Cessation, consciousness is inclined for, tends to, takes shelter in solitude?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv6.5.5</a><span class="add">Andhakas and Uttarapāthakas:</span> If we are wrong, we would just ask you, Is Cessation conditioned? No, you say; then it must be unconditioned.</p>
