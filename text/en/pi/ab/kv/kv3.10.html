<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc152"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That there is self-control among devas.</p>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc153"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.10.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Since you affirm its existence, you imply also <span class="supplied">that there may be</span> absence of it among devas. You deny this, meaning that there is no want of it among devas. Then you imply that there is no <span class="supplied">need of</span> self-control among them—this again you deny, by your proposition.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.10.2"></a>Granting that virtue is restraint from absence of self-restraint, does this restraint exist among devas? “Yes,” you say, but you are hereby implying also the co-existence of absence of self restraint. And this you deny.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.10.2"></a>Yet you admit the co-existence among humans. Why not among devas? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.10.4"></a> For instance, you say “devas abstain from taking life, from intoxicating drinks.” Yet you deny that these vices are found among them. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.10.5"></a> You contend they are not found among them, yet you will not allow that restraint from them is not found either, <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.10.6"></a> <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.10.7"></a> although you allow the co-existence of both among men.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.10.8"></a><span class="add">Opponent:</span> But if moral restraint is absent among devas, surely you are implying that all devas are takers of life, thieves, etc. They are not, hence, etc. …</p>
