<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>

<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.326</a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the fourfold fruition of the religious life is realized by one path only.</p>

<p><a class="pts-vp-en">PC.327</a><a class="pts-cs">Kv18.5.1</a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> This implies a fusion of the four distinct conscious procedures <span class="supplied">experienced in each stage of progress</span>, which you deny.</p>

<p>Moreover, if there be one path only, which of the four is it?</p>

<p><span class="add">Andhakas and Uttarapāthakas:</span> The path of Arahantship.</p>

<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But do we teach that by that path the three first of the ten Fetters are removed—to wit, theory of soul, doubt, and infection of mere rule and ritual? Did not the Exalted One say that these are removed by the Stream-Winning Path?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv18.5.2</a>And are gross passions and malevolence removed by the path of Arahantship? Did not the Exalted One say that the fruit of the Once-Returner was the state of having reduced these to a minimum? <a class="pts-cs">Kv18.5.3</a> And is it by the path of Arahantship that that minimum is removed? You know it is not. If you assent, I can refer you to the words of the Exalted One, who said that the fruit of the Never-Returner was the state of having removed that minimum without remainder.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv18.5.4</a><span class="add">Andhakas and Uttarapāthakas:</span> But if we are wrong, and the Exalted One developed each Path in succession, can he be called Stream- Winner and so on? You deny, but you have implied it.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs">Kv18.5.5</a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But if the Exalted One realized these four fruits of the religious life by one Ariyan Path only, and the disciples by four Paths, they have seen what he did not see, they arrive, at where he did not arrive, they realize that which he did not reaIize. You cannot admit this… </p>
