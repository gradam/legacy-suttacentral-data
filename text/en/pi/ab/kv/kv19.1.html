<h1>19.1. Of getting rid of Corruption</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc334"></a> <span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That we may extirpate corruptions past, future, and present.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.1.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> In other words, we may stop that which has ceased, dismiss that which has departed, destroy that which is destroyed, finish that which is finished, efface that which has vanished. For has not the past ceased? Is it not non-existent?… </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.1.2"></a>And as to the future, you imply that we can produce the unborn, bring forth the non-nascent, bring to pass the unhappened, make patent that which is latent… . For is not the future unborn? Is it not non-existent?… </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.1.3"></a>And as to the present: does the lustful put away lust, the inimical put away hate, the confused put away delusion, the corrupt put away corruption? Or can we put away lust by lust, and so on? You deny all this. But did you not affirm that we can put away present corruptions?… </p>
<p>Is lust and is “Path” a factor in conscious experience? You assent, of course. But can there be a parallel conscious<a class="pc" id="pc335"></a> procedure <span class="add">of both</span> at the same time?… If lust be immoral, and “Path” moral consciousness, can moral and immoral, faulty and innocent, base and noble, sinister and clear mental states co-exist side by side <span class="add">at the same moment</span>? You deny. Think again. Yes, you now reply. But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“There are four things, <i>bhikkhus</i>, very far away one from the other: what are the four? The sky and the earth, the hither and the yonder shore of the ocean, whence the sun rises and where he sets, the norm of the good and that of the wicked. Far is the sky, etc. ….”</span></p>
<p>Hence those mental opposites cannot co-exist side by side.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.1.4"></a><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas:</span> But if it be wrong to say “we can put away past, future, and present corruptions,” is there no such thing as the extirpation of corruptions? You admit there is. Then my proposition stands.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
