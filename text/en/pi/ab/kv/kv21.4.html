<h1>21.4. Of Supernormal Potency (Iddhi)</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc353"></a> <span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That either a Buddha or his disciples have the power of supernormally performing what they intend.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs21.4.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you imply that the one or the other could effect such wishes as “Let trees be ever green! ever blossoming! <a class="pc" id="pc354"></a>ever in fruit! Let there be perpetual moonlight! Let there be constant safety! Let there be constant abundance of alms! Let there be always abundance of grain”? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs21.4.2"></a> Or such wishes as “Let this factor of consciousness that has arisen <span class="supplied">contact, feeling</span>, etc., not cease!” <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs21.4.3"></a> Or such wishes as “Let this body, this mind, become permanent!” <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs21.4.4"></a> Or such wishes as “Let beings subject to birth, old age, disaster, death, not be born, grow old, be unfortunate, die!” All this you deny. Where then is your proposition?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs21.4.5"></a><span class="add">Andhakas:</span> But if I am wrong, how was it that when the venerable Pilindavaccha resolved: “Let the palace of Seniya Bimbisara, King of Magadha, be only of gold!” it was even so?… </p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
