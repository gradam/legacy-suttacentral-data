<h1>13.5. Of One in the Toils.</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc276"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That a Hindrance is cast off by one who is entangled in it.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.5.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Equally then he who is infatuated abandons lust; he who is malign, stupid, corrupt, abandons hate, delusion, corruptions, respectively. Now, does he cast off lust by lust, hate by hate, and so on?</p>
<p><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas:</span> <span class="supplied">If this is not so, you are suggesting that the Hindrances are cast out by the Path.</span> Now you allow that lust, for instance, and the Path are both conscious experiences. But do you not hereby imply a combination of two rival mental procedures? Lust is immoral, the Path is moral—does not your position imply that good and bad, moral and immoral, radiant and sinister mental states.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc277"></a>confront each other in the mind? And was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“These four things are very far apart: the sky and the earth, the hither and the yonder shore of the ocean, whence the sun rises and where he sinks… . Hence far is norm of good from that of evil.”</span></p>
<p>Hence it is also wrong to say good and bad states confront each other in the mind at the same moment.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.5.2"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“With consciousness thus concentrated, made pure, translucent, cleared, void of defilement, made supple, wieldy, firm, imperturbable, he applies and bends over the mind to insight into the destruction of defilements?</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.5.3"></a><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas:</span> But was it not also said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“He thus knowing, thus seeing, his heart is set free from the defilements—sense-desires, lust of becoming, error and delusion.”</span></p>
<p>Hence surely it is one who is entangled by the Hindrances who casts them off.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
