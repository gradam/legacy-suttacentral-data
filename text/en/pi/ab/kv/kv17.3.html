<h1>17.3. Of Everything as due to Karma</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc314"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That all this is from karma.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.4.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you then include karma itself as due to karma? And do you imply that all this is simply the result of bygone causes? You are committed here to what you must deny.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.4.2"></a>Again, you imply, by your proposition, that all this is <span class="supplied">not so much from karma as</span> from the result of <span class="supplied">still earlier</span> karma. If you deny, you deny your first proposition. If you assent, you imply that one may commit murder through <span class="supplied">not karma, but</span> the result of karma. You assent? Then murder, <span class="supplied">though a result</span>, is itself<a class="pc" id="pc315"></a> productive of <span class="supplied">karmic</span> result? You assent? Then the result of karma is productive of result? You deny? Then it is barren of result, and murder must a fortiori be barren of <span class="supplied">karmic</span> result… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.4.3"></a>This argument applies equally to other immoral acts—to theft, to wicked speech—lying, abuse, slander, and idle talk—to burglary, raiding, looting, highway robbery, adultery, destroying houses in village or town. It applies equally to moral acts: to giving gifts—e.g., giving the four necessaries <span class="supplied">to the religious</span>. If any of these is done as the result of karma, and themselves produce karmic result, then <span class="supplied">you are on the horns of this dilemma: that</span> either result-of-karma can itself produce effects <span class="supplied">which is heterodox</span>, or any good or bad deed has no karmic result <span class="supplied">which is heterodox</span>… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.4.4"></a><span class="add">Rājagirikas and Siddhatthikas:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<div class="sutta_ll"><blockquote class="gatha">
<p>
“By kamma the world revolves,<br>
By kamma this generation revolves,<br>
All beings are bound to kamma,<br>
As linch-pin is to chariot-wheel. ”<br>
</p>
<p>“By karma praise and fame are gained,<br>
By karma too generation, killing, bondage.<br>
Knowing the many aspects of kamma,<br>
Who can say ‘there is no karma in the world’.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>Hence surely all this is due to karma?</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
