<h1>4.3. Of the Arahant’s Common Humanity</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc160"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That all that belongs to the Arahant is devoid of defilements.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.3.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> The things devoid of defilements are the Four Paths, the Four Fruits, <i>Nibbāna</i>, and the <span class="supplied">thirty-seven</span> factors of enlightenment; but these do not constitute everything belonging to an Arahant.<a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.3.2"></a> His five sense-organs, for instance, you do not call free from defilements—hence your proposition falls through.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.3.3"></a>His body, again, is destined to be seized and coerced, cut off and broken up, and shared by crows, vultures, and kites—is anything “free from defilements” to be so described?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.3.4"></a>Into his body poison may get, and fire and the knife—is anything “free from defilements” to be so described?</p>
<p>His body may get bound by captivity, by ropes, by chains, may be interned in a village, town, city, or province, may be imprisoned by the fourfold bondage, the fifth being strangling—is anything “free from defilements” liable to this?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.3.5"></a>Moreover, if an Arahant give his robe to a man of the world, does that which was free from defilements thereby become co-intoxicant? You may admit this in general terms, but do you admit that that which is free from defilements may also be the opposite? If you say “yes,” then, by the analogy of the robe, anything else about the Arahant—his religious characters: Path,<a class="pc" id="pc161"></a> Fruit, etc.—having been free from defilements, may become co-intoxicant. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.3.6"></a> The analogy may also be based on the gift of food, lodging, or medicine.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.3.7"></a>Or, conversely, if a man of the world give a robe or<a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.3.8"></a> other requisite to an Arahant, does that which is cointoxicant become thereby the opposite? Does that which has been co-intoxicant become free from defilements—lust, for instance, hate, delusion … indiscretion <span class="supplied">such as beset and characterize the man of the world</span>?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.3.9"></a><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas:</span> You condemn my proposition. But is not the Arahant free from defilements? If he is, then I say that everything connected with him is so.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
