<p><a class="ba" id="ba407"></a> <a class="pts-s" id="pts-s751"></a><a class="pts-p-pi" id="pts-vp-pi306"></a> The basis of knowledge by way of singlefold division: The five types of sense consciousness are not roots; are not accompanied by roots; are not associated with roots; are with cause; are conditioned; are not material; are mundane; are objects of the defilements; are objects of the fetters; are objects of the ties; are objects of the floods; are objects of the bonds; are objects of the hindrances; are objects of the perversions; are objects of the graspings; are objects of the corruptions; are neither-skilful-nor-unskilful; have objects; are not volitional activities; are resultants; are grasped (by craving and false view), are objects of the graspings; are not corrupt, are objects of the corruptions; are not “accompanied by initial application, accompanied by sustained application”; are not “without initial application, sustained application only”; are without initial application, without sustained application; are not accompanied by rapture; are not to be abandoned either by the first path or by the subsequent paths; have no roots to be abandoned either by the first path or by the subsequent paths; are neither cumulative nor dispersive (of continuing rebirth and death); <a class="pts-p-pi" id="pts-vp-pi307"></a> are neither of the seven supramundane stages nor of the final supramundane stage; are low; are characteristic of the plane of desire; are not characteristic of the plane of form; are not characteristic of the formless plane; are included (i.e. are mundane); are not “not included” (i.e. not supramundane); are of no fixed (resultant time); do not tend to release.</p>
<p>(The five types of sense consciousness) Have arisen sense-bases; have arisen objects; have pre-existing sense-bases; have pre-existing objects; have internal sense-bases; have external objects; have non-disintegrated sense-bases; have non-disintegrated objects; have different sense-bases; have different objects; do not experience each other’s object; do not arise without advertence; do not arise without attention; do not arise consecutively, do not arise simultaneously; do not arise immediately following each other.</p>
<p><a class="ba" id="ba408"></a>The five types of sense consciousness are not cognitive; by the five types of sense consciousness one discriminates no state whatever other than mere falling in (i.e. entry of the object); even immediately following the five types of sense consciousness one discriminates no state whatever; by the five types of sense consciousness one makes no posture whatever; even immediately following the five types of sense consciousness one makes no posture whatever; by the five types of sense consciousness one establishes no bodily action, no verbal action; even immediately following the five types of sense consciousness one establishes no bodily action, no verbal action; by the five types of sense consciousness one performs no skilful or unskilful state; even immediately following the five types of sense consciousness one performs no skilful or unskilful state; <a class="pts-p-pi" id="pts-vp-pi308"></a> by the five types of sense consciousness one does not attain, does not emerge (from <i>samādhi</i>); even immediately following the five types of sense consciousness one does not attain, does not emerge; by the five types of sense consciousness one does not pass away, does not arise (i.e. is not re-born); even immediately following the five types of sense consciousness one does not pass away, does not arise; by the five types of sense consciousness one does not sleep, does not wake, does not see dreams; even immediately following the five types of sense consciousness one does not sleep, does not wake, does not see dreams; the explanation of the true nature of the basis (of knowledge) is wisdom.

<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s810"></a>Therein what is “<span class="term">the Tathāgata’s knowledge as it really is by way of cause, by way of root, of the resultant of past, future and present actions that are performed</span>”? Herein the Tathāgata comprehends thus; there are some bad actions performed, which, prevented by fortunate rebirth, do not mature; there are some bad actions performed, which, prevented by a fortunate body, do not mature; there are some bad actions performed, which, prevented by fortunate time, do not mature; there are some bad actions performed, which, prevented by fortunate effort, do not mature.</p>
<p>There are some bad actions performed, which, because of unfortunate rebirth, do mature; there are some bad actions performed, which, because of an unfortunate body, do mature; there are some bad actions performed, which, because of unfortunate time, do mature; there are some bad actions performed, which, because of unfortunate effort, do mature.</p>

Herein the Tathāgata comprehends the different aggregates; he comprehends the different sense-bases; he comprehends the different elements; he comprehends the different worlds that have many elements, different elements; thus that which therein is wisdom, understanding, <span class="add">See section <a class="cr" href="./vb12#pts-cs-525">525</a>.</span> absence of delusion, truth investigation, right view.

<p><a class="ba" id="ba445"></a><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s813"></a>Therein what is “<span class="term">the Tathāgata’s knowledge as it really is of the different dispositions of beings</span>”? Herein the Tathāgata comprehends thus, “There are beings of inferior disposition; there are beings of superior disposition. Beings of inferior disposition depend on, approach, frequent beings of inferior disposition. Beings of superior disposition depend on, approach, frequent beings of superior disposition.</p>
<p>In the past, too, beings of inferior disposition depended on, approached, frequented beings of inferior disposition. Beings of superior disposition depended on, approached, frequented beings of superior disposition.</p>

This is the Tathāgata’s knowledge as it really is of the different dispositions of beings. (5)</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s814"></a>Therein what is “<span class="term">the Tathāgata’s knowledge as it really is of the improvement, of the deterioration of the faculty of other beings, of other persons</span>”? Herein the Tathāgata comprehends the inclination of beings; he comprehends the latent tendency; he comprehends characteristic action; he comprehends disposition; he comprehends beings with little dust in their eyes, with much dust in their eyes, with sharp faculties, with weak faculties, of skilful qualities, of unskilful qualities, easy to instruct, hard to instruct, fit or not fit.</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s815"></a>And what is the <span class="term">inclination (of thought) of beings</span>? “The world is eternal” or “the world is not eternal”, “the world is finite” or “the world is infinite”, “vital principle and the body are the same” or “vital principle and the body are different”, “the Tathāgata exists after death” or “the Tathāgata does not exist after death” or “the Tathāgata exists and does not exist after death” or “the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death”, thus there are beings depending on existence views, depending on non-existence views. By not adhering to both these extremes, ability in conformity and<a class="ba" id="ba446"></a> knowledge as it really is in specific causality and dependently originated <i>dhammas</i> is gained. This is the inclination of beings.</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s816"></a>And what is <span class="term">latent tendency of beings</span>? The seven latent tendencies are: Latent tendency to sensuous lust, latent tendency to repulsion, latent tendency to conceit, latent tendency to wrong view, latent tendency to doubt, latent tendency to lust for existence, latent tendency to ignorance. That which in the world is a lovely thing, pleasant thing, the tendency of beings to lust for that lies latent; that which in the world is an unlovely thing, unpleasant thing, the tendency of beings to repulsion for that lies latent. Thus in these two <i>dhammas</i> it should be understood that ignorance continuously occurs, and coupled therewith, conceit, wrong view and doubt. This is latent tendency of beings.</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s817"></a>And what is the <span class="term">characteristic action of beings</span>? Activity producing skilful (resultant), activity producing unskilful (resultant), activity producing unshakeable (resultant), having low level or having high level.

There are beings of inferior disposition; there are beings of superior disposition; beings of inferior disposition depend on, <a class="pts-p-pi" id="pts-vp-pi341"></a> approach, frequent beings of inferior disposition. Beings of superior disposition depend on, approach, frequent beings of superior disposition.</p>
<p>In the past, too, beings of inferior disposition depended on, approached, frequented beings of inferior disposition. Beings of superior disposition depended on, approached, frequented beings of superior disposition.</p>
<p>In the future, too, beings of inferior disposition will depend on, will approach, will frequent beings of inferior disposition. Beings of superior disposition will depend on, will approach, will frequent beings of superior disposition. This is disposition of beings.</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s819"></a>Who are those <span class="term">beings with much dust in their eyes</span>? The ten sense-bases of the corruptions are; Greed, hatred, delusion, conceit, wrong view, doubt, sloth, distraction, absence of sense of shame, absence of fear of blame; those beings in whom these ten sense-bases of corruption are pursued, developed, repeated, enlarged.

Those beings who have bad inclinations, have bad latent tendencies, have bad characteristic actions, have bad dispositions, have much dust in their eyes, have weak faculties. These are those beings with unskilful qualities.</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s824"></a>Who are those <span class="term">beings with skilful qualities</span>? Those beings who have sound inclinations, have sound characteristic actions, have sound dispositions, have little dust in their eyes, have sharp faculties. These are those beings with skilful qualities.</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s825"></a>Who are those <span class="term">beings hard to instruct</span>? Those beings who have unskilful qualities, they indeed are those beings hard to instruct. Those beings who have skilful qualities, they indeed are those beings easy to instruct.</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s826"></a>Who are those <span class="term">beings who are not fit</span>? Those beings who are furnished with the obstruction of (unskilful) action, furnished with the obstruction of corruption, furnished with the obstruction of (unskilful) resultant, have no confidence, have no wish (to do skilful), have no wisdom (accompanying rebirth consciousness), are not fit to enter into the immutable rightness of skilful <i>dhammas</i> (i.e. path consciousness). These are those beings who are not fit. <a class="pts-p-pi" id="pts-vp-pi342"></a></p>

These are those beings who are fit; thus, that which therein is wisdom, understanding, <span class="add">See section <a class="cr" href="./vb12#pts-cs-525">525</a>.</span> absence of delusion, truth investigation, right view. This is the Tathāgata’s knowledge as it really is of the improvement, of the deterioration of the faculty of other beings, of other persons. (6)</p>
