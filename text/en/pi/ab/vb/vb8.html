<p><a class="ba" id="ba271"></a><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s390"></a><a class="pts-p-pi" id="pts-p-pi208"></a> The four right strivings. Herein a monk engenders wish, makes effort, arouses energy, exerts the mind, strives for the non-arising of bad unskilful <i>dhammas</i> that have not arisen; engenders wish, makes effort, arouses energy, exerts the mind, strives for the abandoning of bad unskilful <i>dhammas</i> that have arisen; engenders wish, makes effort, arouses energy, exerts the mind, strives for the arising of skilful <i>dhammas</i> that have not arisen; engenders wish, makes effort, arouses energy, exerts the mind, strives for the stabilizing, for the collocation, for the increase, for the maturity, for the development, for the completion of skilful <i>dhammas</i> that have arisen.</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s391"></a>And how does a monk engender wish, make effort, arouse energy, exert the mind, strive for the non-arising of <span class="term">bad unskilful dhammas</span> that have not arisen? Therein what are bad unskilful <i>dhammas</i> that have not arisen? The three unskilful roots (i.e.) greed, hatred, delusion and the corruptions occurring therewith; the aggregate of feeling, aggregate of perception, aggregate of volitional activities, aggregate of consciousness associated therewith; the bodily action, verbal action, mental action generated thereby. These are called bad unskilful <i>dhammas</i> that have not arisen. Thus he engenders wish, makes effort, arouses energy, exerts the mind, strives for the non-arising of these bad unskilful <i>dhammas</i> that have not arisen.</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s392"></a>“<span class="term">Engenders wish</span>” means: Therein what is <span class="term">wish</span>? That which is wish, act of wishing, desire to do, skilful righteous wish. This is called wish.

<h2>8.3. Interrogation</h2>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s427"></a>The four right strivings.

<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s428"></a>Of the four right strivings how many are skilful; how many unskilful; how many neither-skilful-nor-unskilful. <span class="add">Remaining appropriate triplets and couplets.</span> How many with cause of bewailing; how many without cause of bewailing? </p>
<h3>8.3.1. The Triplets</h3>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s429"></a>(The four right strivings) Are only skilful. Sometimes are associated with pleasant feeling; sometimes are associated with neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Are productive of resultant. <a class="pts-p-pi" id="pts-p-pi215"></a> Are not grasped (by craving and false view), are not objects of the graspings. Are not corrupt, are not objects of the corruptions. Sometimes are accompanied by initial application, accompanied by sustained application; sometimes are without initial<a class="ba" id="ba280"></a> application, sustained application only; sometimes are without initial application, without sustained application. Sometimes are accompanied by rapture; sometimes are accompanied by pleasure; sometimes are accompanied by indifference. Are not to be abandoned either by the first path or by the subsequent paths. Have no roots to be abandoned either by the first path or by the subsequent paths. Are dispersive (of continuing rebirth and death). Are of the seven supramundane stages. Are immeasurable. Have immeasurable object. Are superior. Are right (<i>dhammas</i> with) fixed (resultant) time. Do not have path as their object; have path as their cause; sometimes have path as their dominating factor; sometimes should not be said to have, path as their dominating factor. Sometimes are risen; sometimes are not risen; should not be said to be, bound to arise. Sometimes are past; sometimes are future; sometimes are present. Should not be said to have either, past object; future object or present object. Sometimes are internal; sometimes are external; sometimes are both internal and external. Have external object. Are not visible, are not impingent.</p>
<h3>8.3.2. The Couplets</h3>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s430"></a>(The four right strivings) Are not roots. Are not accompanied by roots. Are associated with roots.
