Herein a monk dwells contemplating body in the body internally; dwells contemplating body in the body externally; dwells contemplating body in the body both internally and externally, ardent, aware, mindful; removing covetousness and mental pain in the world. He dwells contemplating feeling in feelings internally; dwells contemplating feeling in feelings externally; dwells contemplating feeling in feelings both internally and externally, ardent, aware, mindful; removing covetousness and mental pain in the world. He dwells contemplating consciousness in consciousness internally; dwells contemplating consciousness in consciousness externally; dwells contemplating consciousness in consciousness both internally and externally, ardent, aware, mindful; removing covetousness and mental pain in the world. He dwells contemplating mental state in mental <i>dhammas</i> internally; dwells contemplating mental state in mental <i>dhammas</i> externally; dwells contemplating mental state in mental <i>dhammas</i> both internally and externally, ardent, aware, mindful; removing covetousness and mental pain in the world.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs-356">356</a>And how does a monk dwell contemplating body in the body internally? Herein a monk reflects on the body internally, upward from the soles of the feet, downward from the tips of the hair, enclosed in skin, full of divers impurities, thus, “There is in this body head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin; flesh, sinews, bone, bone marrow, kidneys; heart, liver, membraneous tissue, spleen, lungs; intestines, mesentery, undigested food, excrement; bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat; tears, lymph, saliva, nasal mucus,<a class="pts-vp-en">252</a> synovial fluid, urine”.
