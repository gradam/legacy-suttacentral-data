<p><a class="ba" id="ba297"></a><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s466"></a><a class="pts-p-pi" id="pts-p-pi227"></a> The seven awakening factors are: Mindfulness-awakening-factor, truth investigation-awakening-factor, energy-awakening-factor, rapture-awakening-factor, calmness-awakening-factor, <i>samādhi</i>-awakening-factor, equanimity-awakening-factor.</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s467"></a>Therein what is <span class="term">mindfulness-awakening-factor</span>? Herein a monk is mindful, furnished with excellent mindfulness-penetration, he remembers, remembers constantly, what has long been done and long been said (concerning release). This is called mindfulness-awakening-factor. (1)</p>
<p>He, dwelling mindful in the above manner, searches, investigates and reasons out thoroughly that same thing with wisdom. This is called truth investigation-awakening-factor. (2)</p>
<p>The energy of his searching, investigating and reasoning out thoroughly that same thing with wisdom, is strenuous, unshrinking. This is called energy-awakening-factor. (3)</p>
<p>For him of strenuous energy there arises rapture that is not worldly. This is called rapture-awakening-factor. (4)</p>
<p>For him of raptureful mind the body (of mental aggregates) becomes calm, also consciousness becomes calm. This is called calmness-awakening-factor. (5)</p>
<p>For him of calm body (of mental aggregates) and mental pleasure, consciousness is in <i>samādhi</i>. This is called <i>samādhi</i>-awakening-factor. (6)</p>
<p>He, having consciousness in <i>samādhi</i> in the above manner, is well balanced. This is called equanimity-awakening-factor. (7)</p>
