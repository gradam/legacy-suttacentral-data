<p>The full text together with introduction is available on our <a href="http://suttacentral.net/downloads" target="_blank">Downloads</a> page.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation more closely in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms.
