<p>Therein what is <span class="term">analytic insight of origin</span>? Herein a monk knows the Teaching; discourses in prose; discourses in prose and verse; expositions; verses; verses of joyous utterance; (quotations beginning) “thus it was said …”; birth stories; statements dealing with unique occurrences; miscellanies. This is called analytic insight of origin. He knows the meaning of this and that that is said thus, “this is the meaning of this that is said; this is the meaning of that that is said”. This is called analytic insight of consequence. Knowledge of the actual philological definition of these is analytic insight of philology; knowledge of (these) knowledges is analytic insight of knowledge. This is doctrine section.</p>

<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s746"></a>The four analytic insights are: The analytic insight of consequence, analytic insight of origin, analytic insight of philology, analytic insight of knowledge. Three analytic insights arise in the four types of consciousness associated with knowledge from the skilful <i>dhammas</i> characteristic of the plane of desire (also) in the four types of consciousness associated with knowledge from the inoperative <i>dhammas</i>. Analytic insight of consequence also arises in these and arises in the four paths and four fruits.</p>
