</div>
<h2>1. The Section Derived from the Discourses</h2>
<h3>1.0 <span class="add">The Outline of Conditional Origination</span></h3>
<p><a class="ba" id="ba180"></a><a class="pts-p-pi" id="pts-p-pi135"></a><a class="pts-s"></a>With ignorance as condition there are (volitional) processes, with (volitional) processes as condition: consciousness, with consciousness as condition: mind and bodily form, with mind and bodily form as condition: the six sense spheres, with the six sense spheres as condition: contact, with contact as condition: feeling, with feeling as condition: craving, with craving as condition: attachment, with attachment as condition: continuation, with continuation as condition: birth, with birth as condition: ageing, death, grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow and despair (all) arise, and so there is an origination of this whole mass of suffering.</p>
<h3>1.1 <span class="add">Definition of Ignorance</span></h3>
<p><a class="pts-s"></a>Herein, what is ‘<span class="term">ignorance</span>?’</p>
<p>Not knowing suffering,  not knowing the origination of suffering,  not knowing the cessation of suffering,  not knowing the path leading to the cessation of suffering.</p>
<p>This is called ‘<span class="term">ignorance</span>’.</p>
<h3>1.2 <span class="add">Definition of (Volitional) Processes</span></h3>
<p>Herein, what is ‘<span class="term">with ignorance as condition there are (volitional) processes</span>?’</p>
<p>(There is) a meritorious (volitional) process,  a demeritorious (volitional) process,  an impertubable (volitional) process,   a (volitional) process expressed by way of the body,  a (volitional) process expressed by way of speech,  a (volitional) process expressed by way of the mind.</p>
<p>Herein, what is a meritorious (volitional) process?</p>
<p>(There are) wholesome intentions in the sense-world sphere, in the form-world sphere, consisting of generosity, consisting of morality, consisting of meditation,  this is said to be a meritorious (volitional) process.</p>
<p>Herein, what is a demeritorious (volitional) process?</p>
<p>(There are) unwholesome intentions in the sense-world sphere, this is said to be a demeritorious (volitional) process.</p>
<p>Herein, what is an impertubable (volitional) process?</p>
<p>(There are) wholesome intentions in the formless-world sphere, this is said to be an impertubable (volitional) process.</p>
<p><a class="ba" id="ba181"></a>Herein, what is a (volitional) process expressed by way of the body?</p>
<p>(There is) an intention expressed by way of the body, a (volitional) process expressed by way of the body.  (There is) an intention expressed by way of speech, a (volitional) process expressed by way of speech.   (There is) an intention expressed by way of the mind, a (volitional) process expressed by way of the mind.</p>
<p><a class="pts-p-pi" id="pts-p-pi136"></a>This is said to be ‘<span class="term">with ignorance as condition there are (volitional) processes</span>’.</p>
<h3>1.3 <span class="add">Definition of Consciousness</span></h3>

<p>(There is) eye-consciousness,  ear-consciousness,  nose-consciousness,  tongue-consciousness,  body-consciousness,  mind-consciousness.</p>
<p>This is said to be ‘<span class="term">with (volitional) processes as condition: consciousness</span>’.</p>
<h3>1.4 <span class="add">Definition of Mind and Bodily Form</span></h3>
<p><a class="pts-s"></a>Herein, what is ‘<span class="term">with consciousness as condition: mind and bodily form</span>?’</p>
<p>There is mind, there is bodily form.</p>
<p>Herein, what is ‘<span class="term">mind</span>?’</p>
<p>(There is) the feeling constituent, the perception constituent, the (volitional) processes constituent.</p>
<p>This is said to be ‘<span class="term">mind</span>’.</p>
<p>Herein, what is ‘<span class="term">bodily form</span>?’</p>
<p>(There are) the four great entities, and the bodily form attached to the four great entities, this is said to be ‘<span class="term">bodily form</span>’.</p>
<p>Thus, this is mind and this is bodily form.</p>
<p>This is said to be ‘<span class="term">with consciousness as condition: mind and bodily form</span>’.</p>
<h3>1.5 <span class="add">Definition of the Six Sense Spheres</span></h3>
<p><a class="pts-s"></a>Herein, what is ‘<span class="term">with mind and bodily form as condition: the six sense spheres</span>?’</p>
<p>(There is the) eye sense sphere,  ear sense sphere,  nose sense sphere,  tongue sense sphere,  body sense sphere,  mind sense sphere.</p>
<p>This is said to be ‘<span class="term">with mind and bodily form as condition: the six sense spheres</span>’.</p>

<h3>1.10 <span class="add">Definition of Continuation</span></h3>
<p><a class="pts-s"></a>Herein, what is ‘<span class="term">with attachment as condition: continuation</span>?’</p>
<p><a class="pts-p-pi" id="pts-p-pi137"></a>Continuation is two-fold: there is continuation through (intentional) deeds, there is continuation through rebirth.</p>
<p>Herein, what is ‘<span class="term">continuation through (intentional) deeds</span>?’</p>
<p>(There is) a meritorious (volitional) process,  a demeritorious (volitional) process,  an impertubable (volitional) process.</p>
<p>This is said to be ‘<span class="term">continuation through (intentional) deeds</span>’.</p>
<p>All (intentional) deeds leading to continuation  is continuation from (intentional) deeds.</p>
<p>Herein, what is ‘<span class="term">continuation through rebirth</span>?’</p>
<p>(There is) continuation in the sense-world spheres,  continuation in the form-world spheres,  continuation in the formless-world spheres,  continuation with perception,  continuation without perception,   continuation with neither-perception-nor-non-perception,   continuation with one constituent,  continuation with four constituents,  continuation with five constituents.</p>
<p>This is said to be ‘<span class="term">continuation through rebirth</span>’.</p>
<p>Thus, this is continuation through (intentional) deeds, this is continuation through rebirth.</p>
<p>This is said to be ‘<span class="term">with attachment as condition: continuation</span>’.</p>
<h3>1.11 <span class="add">Definition of Birth</span></h3>

<p>For the various beings in the various classes of beings (there is) birth, being born, appearing, arising, turning up, the manifestation of the constituents (of mind and bodily form), the acquisition of the sense spheres.</p>
<p>This is said to be ‘<span class="term">with continuation as condition: birth</span>’.</p>
<h3>1.12 <span class="add">Definition of Ageing and Death</span></h3>
<p><a class="pts-s"></a>Herein, what is ‘<span class="term">with birth as condition: ageing, death</span>?’</p>
<p>There is ageing, there is death.</p>
<p>Herein, what is ‘<span class="term">ageing</span>?’</p>
<p>For the various beings in the various classes of beings (there is) broken teeth, greying hair, and wrinkled skin, the dwindling away of the life span, the decay of the sense faculties: this is said to be ‘<span class="term">ageing</span>’.</p>
<p>Herein, what is ‘<span class="term">death</span>?’</p>
<p>For the various beings in the various classes of beings there is a fall, a falling away, a breaking up, a disappearance, a dying, a death, a making of time, the break up of the constituents (of mind and bodily form), the throwing off of the body, a cutting off of the life-faculty: this is called ‘<span class="term">death</span>’.</p>
<p>Thus, this is ageing and this is death.</p>
<p>This is said to be ‘<span class="term">with birth as condition: ageing, death</span>’.</p>
