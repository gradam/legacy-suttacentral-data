<h2>1.1. Analysis According To The Discourses</h2>
<p><a class="pts-p-pi" id="pts-p-pi1"></a><a class="ba" id="ba1"></a><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s1"></a>The five aggregates are: The aggregate of form, aggregate of feeling, aggregate of perception, aggregate of volitional activities, aggregate of consciousness.</p>
<h3>1.1.1. The Aggregate Of Form</h3>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s2"></a>Therein what is the <span class="term">aggregate of form</span>? Whatever form is past, future or present, internal or external gross or subtle, inferior or superior, distant or proximate; (taking) these together collectively and briefly, this is called the aggregate of form.</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s3"></a>Therein what is <span class="term">past form</span>? That form which is past, ceased, dissolved, changed, terminated, disappeared, or which having arisen has dissolved, has passed and is classed<a class="ba" id="ba2"></a> among the things that are past, (i.e.) the four great essentials and the material qualities derived from the four great essentials. This is called past form.</p>
<p>Therein what is <span class="term">future form</span>? That form which is not born, not become, not begotten, non-existent, fully non-existent, not apparent, not risen, not well risen, not uprisen, not well uprisen, which is future and is classed among the things that are future, (i.e.) the four great essentials and the material qualities derived from the four great essentials. This is called future form.</p>
<p>Therein what <span class="term">is present form</span>? That form which is born, become, begotten, existent, fully existent, apparent, risen, well risen, uprisen, well uprisen, which is present and is classed among the things that are present, <a class="pts-p-pi" id="pts-p-pi2"></a> (i.e.) the four great essentials and the material qualities derived from the four great essentials. This is called present form.</p>

That form which, for this or that being, is personal, self-referable, one’s own, individual and is grasped (by craving and false view), (i.e.) the four great essentials and the material qualities derived from the four great essentials. This is called internal form.</p>
<p>Therein what is <span class="term">external form</span>? That form which, for this or that other being, for other persons, is personal, self-referable, one’s own, individual and is grasped, (i.e.) the four great essentials and the material qualities derived from the four great essentials.

Is not corrupt, is the object of the corruptions. Is not “accompanied by initial application, accompanied by sustained application”. Is not “without initial application, sustained application only”. Is without initial application, without sustained application. Is not accompanied by rapture. Is not accompanied by pleasure. Is not accompanied by<a class="ba" id="ba17"></a> indifference. Is not to be abandoned either by the first path or by the subsequent paths. Has no root to be abandoned either by the first path or by the subsequent paths.

<h3>1.3.1. The Triplets</h3>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s152"></a>The aggregate of form is neither-skilful-nor-unskilful. Four aggregates sometimes are skilful; sometimes are unskilful; sometimes are neither-skilful-nor-unskilful. Two aggregates should not be said to be either, associated with pleasant feeling; associated with painful feeling or associated with neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Three aggregates sometimes are associated with pleasant feeling; sometimes are associated with painful feeling; sometimes are associated with neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. The aggregate of form is neither resultant nor productive of resultant. Four aggregates sometimes are resultants; sometimes are productive of resultants; sometimes are neither resultants nor productive of resultants. The aggregate of form sometimes is grasped (by craving and false view), is the object of the graspings; sometimes is not grasped, is the object of the graspings. Four aggregates sometimes are grasped, are objects of the graspings; sometimes are not grasped, are objects of the graspings; sometimes are not grasped, are not objects of the graspings.</p>
<p>The aggregate of form is not corrupt, is the object of the corruptions. Four aggregates sometimes are corrupt, are objects of the corruptions; sometimes are not corrupt, are objects of the corruptions; sometimes are not corrupt, are not objects of the corruptions. The aggregate of form is without initial application, without sustained application. Three aggregates sometimes are accompanied by initial application, accompanied by sustained application; sometimes are without initial application,<a class="ba" id="ba77"></a> sustained application only; sometimes are without initial application, without sustained application. The aggregate of volitional activities sometimes is accompanied by initial application, accompanied by sustained application; sometimes is without initial application, sustained application only; sometimes is without initial application, without sustained application; sometimes should not be said to be either, accompanied by initial application, accompanied by sustained application; without initial application, sustained application only or without initial application, without sustained application. The aggregate of form should not be said to be either, accompanied by rapture; accompanied by pleasure or accompanied by indifference. The aggregate of feeling sometimes is accompanied by rapture; is not accompanied by pleasure; is not accompanied by indifference; sometimes should not be said to be, accompanied by rapture. Three aggregates sometimes are accompanied by rapture; sometimes are accompanied by pleasure; sometimes are accompanied by indifference; sometimes should not be said to be either, accompanied by rapture; accompanied by pleasure or accompanied by indifference. The aggregate of form is not to be abandoned either by the first path or by the subsequent paths. Four aggregates sometimes are to be abandoned by the first path; sometimes are to be abandoned by the subsequent paths; sometimes are not to be abandoned either by the first path or by the subsequent paths.</p>
<p>The aggregate of form has no root to be abandoned either by the first path or by the subsequent paths. Four aggregates sometimes have roots to be abandoned by the first path; sometimes have roots to be abandoned by the subsequent paths; sometimes have no roots to be abandoned either by the first path or by the subsequent paths. The aggregate of form is neither cumulative nor dispersive (of continuing rebirth and death). Four aggregates sometimes are cumulative; sometimes are dispersive; sometimes are neither cumulative nor dispersive. The aggregate of form is neither of the seven supramundane stages nor of the final supramundane stage. Four aggregates sometimes are of the seven supramundane stages; sometimes are of the final supramundane stage; sometimes are neither of the seven supramundane stages nor of the final supramundane stage. The aggregate of form is low. Four aggregates sometimes are low; sometimes are sublime; sometimes<a class="ba" id="ba78"></a> are immeasurable. The aggregate of form has no object. Four aggregates sometimes have low objects; sometimes have sublime objects; sometimes have immeasurable objects; sometimes should not be said to have either, low objects; <a class="pts-p-pi" id="pts-p-pi63"></a> sublime objects or immeasurable objects.
