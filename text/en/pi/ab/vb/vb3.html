<h2>3.1. Analysis According To The Discourses</h2>
<p><a class="ba" id="ba107"></a><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s172"></a><a class="pts-p-pi" id="pts-p-pi82"></a> Six elements are: The element of extension, element of cohesion, element of heat, element of motion, element of space, element of consciousness.</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s173"></a>Therein what is the <span class="term">element of extension</span>? The element of extension is twofold: (It) Is internal; (it) is external. Therein what is internal element of extension? That which is personal, self-referable, hard, harsh, hardness, being hard, internal, grasped (by craving and false view). For example: head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin; flesh, sinews, bone, bone-marrow, kidneys; heart, liver, membraneous tissue, spleen, lungs; intestines, mesentery, undigested food, excrement; or whatever else there is, personal, self-referable, hard, harsh, hardness, being hard, internal, grasped. This is called internal element of extension.</p>
<p>Therein what is external element of extension? That which is external, hard, harsh, hardness, being hard, external, not grasped. For example; iron, copper, tin, lead, silver, pearl, gem, cat’s-eye, shell, stone, coral, silver coin, gold, ruby, variegated precious stone, grass, wood, gravel, potsherd, earth, rock, mountain; or whatever else there is, external, hard, harsh, hardness, being hard, external, not grasped. This is called external element of extension. That which is internal element of extension and that which is external element of extension; (taking) these together collectively and briefly, this is called the element of extension. (1) <a class="pts-p-pi" id="pts-p-pi83"></a></p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s174"></a>Therein what is the element of cohesion? The element of cohesion is twofold: (It) Is internal; (it) is external. Therein what is internal element of cohesion? That which is personal, self-referable, water, fluid, viscid, viscous, cohesiveness of form, internal, grasped. For example; bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, lymph, saliva, nasal mucus, synovial fluid, urine; or whatever else there is, personal, self-referable, water, fluid, viscid, viscous,<a class="ba" id="ba108"></a> cohesiveness of form, internal, grasped. This is called internal element of cohesion.</p>
<p>Therein what is external element of cohesion? That which is external, water, fluid, viscid, viscous, cohesiveness of form, external, not grasped. For example; the juice of roots, juice of stems, juice of bark, juice of leaves, juice of flowers, juice of fruits, milk, soft curd, clarified butter, fresh butter, oil, honey, molasses, waters of the earth or sky; or whatever else there is, external, water, fluid, viscid, viscous, cohesiveness of form, external, not grasped.

That which is internal element of cohesion and that which is external element of cohesion; (taking) these together collectively and briefly, this is called the element of cohesion. (2)</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s175"></a>Therein what is the <span class="term">element of heat</span>? The element of heat is twofold: (It) Is internal; (it) is external. Therein what is internal element of heat? That which is personal, self-referable, fire, fiery, heat, hot, warmth, warm, internal, grasped. For example; that by which (one) is heated; that by which (one) becomes decayed; that by which (one) is burned up; that by which the eaten, the drunk, the chewed, the tasted gets completely digested; or whatever else there is, personal, self-referable, fire, fiery, heat, hot, warmth, warm, internal, grasped. This is called internal element of heat.</p>
<p>Therein what is external element of heat? That which is external, fire, fiery, heat, hot, warmth, warm, external, not grasped. For example; wood-fire, straw-fire, grass-fire, cow-dung-fire, husk-fire, rubbish-fire, lightning-fire (i.e. lightning), fire-heat, sun-heat, heat (generated) in a heap of wood, heat (generated) in a heap of grass, heat (generated) in a heap of paddy, heat (generated) in a heap of goods; or whatever else there is, external, fire, fiery, heat, hot, warmth, warm, external, not grasped.

This is called external element of motion. That which is internal element of motion and that which is external element of motion; (taking) these together collectively and briefly, this is called the element of motion. (4)</p>
