At Savatthi…. The Blessed One then said to the Venerable Ananda as he was
sitting to one side:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“If, Ananda, they were to ask you: ‘Friend Ananda, what are the things of
which an arising was discerned, a vanishing was discerned, an alteration of
that which stands was discerned? What are the things of which an arising
will be discerned, a vanishing will be discerned, an alteration of that
which stands will be discerned? What are the things of which an arising is
discerned, a vanishing is discerned, an alteration of that which stands is
discerned?’—being asked thus, Ananda, how would you answer?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“Venerable sir, if they were to ask me this,
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iii.39"></a>
I would answer thus: ‘Friends, with form that has passed, ceased, changed,
an arising was discerned, a vanishing was discerned, an alteration of that
which stands was discerned. With feeling … perception … volitional
formations … consciousness that has passed, ceased, changed, an arising was
discerned, a vanishing was discerned, an alteration of that which stands was
discerned. It is of these things, friends, that an arising was discerned,
that a vanishing was discerned, that an alteration of that which stands was
discerned.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“‘Friends, with form that has not been born, not become manifest, an
arising will be discerned, a vanishing will be discerned, an alteration of
that which stands will be discerned. With feeling … perception … volitional
formations … consciousness that has not been born, not become manifest, an
arising will be discerned, a vanishing will be discerned, an alteration of
that which stands will be discerned. It is of these things, friends, that an
arising will be discerned, that a vanishing will be discerned, that an
alteration of that which stands will be discerned.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
“‘Friends, with form that has been born, that has become manifest, an
arising is discerned, a vanishing is discerned, an alteration of that which
stands is discerned. With feeling … perception … volitional formations …
consciousness that has been born, that has become manifest, an arising is
discerned, a vanishing is discerned, an alteration of that which stands is
discerned. It is of these things, friends, that an arising is discerned,
that a vanishing is discerned, that an alteration of that which stands is
discerned.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
“Being asked thus, venerable sir, I would answer in such a way.”</p>
<p>“Good, good, Ananda!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>
<span class="add show">The Buddha here repeats the entire answer of the Venerable Ananda, concluding:</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iii.40"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>
“Being asked thus, Ananda, you should answer in such a way.”</p>
