</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapiṇḍika’s Park. Then, when the night had advanced, a certain devata of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, stood to one side, and recited these verses in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a> “When one’s house is ablaze<br>
The vessel taken out<br>
Is the one that is useful,<br>
Not the one left burnt inside.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a> “So when the world is ablaze<br>
With <span class="add show">the fires of</span> aging and death,<br>
One should take out <span class="add show">one’s wealth</span> by giving:<br>
What is given is well salvaged. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.i.32"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a> “What is given yields pleasant fruit,<br>
But not so what is not given.<br>
Thieves take it away, or kings,<br>
It gets burnt by fire or is lost.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a> “Then in the end one leaves the body<br>
Along with one’s possessions.<br>
Having understood this, the wise person<br>
Should enjoy himself but also give.<br>
Having given and enjoyed as fits his means,<br>
Blameless he goes to the heavenly state.”</p>
