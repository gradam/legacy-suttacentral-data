“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the Dhamma for abandoning all through direct
knowledge and full understanding. Listen to that….</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“And what, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma for abandoning all through direct
knowledge and full understanding? The eye is to be abandoned through direct
knowledge and full understanding, forms are to be so abandoned,
eye-consciousness is to be so abandoned, eye-contact is to be so abandoned,
and whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—whether pleasant
or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is to be abandoned
through direct knowledge and full understanding.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“The ear is to be abandoned through direct knowledge and full understanding
… The mind is to be abandoned through direct knowledge and full
understanding, mental phenomena
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.17"></a>
are to be so abandoned, mind-consciousness is to be so abandoned,
mind-contact is to be so abandoned, and whatever feeling arises with
mind-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or
neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is to be abandoned through direct
knowledge and full understanding.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“This, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma for abandoning all through direct knowledge
and full understanding.”</p>
