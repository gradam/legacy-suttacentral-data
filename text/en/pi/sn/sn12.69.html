<span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed
One was dwelling at Savatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapiṇḍika’s Park. There
the Blessed One said:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“Bhikkhus, the ocean surging causes the rivers to surge; the rivers surging
cause the streams to surge; the streams surging cause the lakes to surge;
the lakes surging cause the pools to surge. So too, ignorance surging causes
volitional formations to surge; volitional formations surging cause
consciousness to surge; consciousness surging causes name-and-form to surge;
name-and-form surging causes the six sense bases to surge; the six sense
bases surging cause contact to surge; contact surging causes feeling to
surge; feeling surging causes craving to surge; craving surging causes
clinging to surge; clinging
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.119"></a>
surging causes existence to surge; existence surging causes birth to surge;
birth surging causes aging-and-death to surge.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“Bhikkhus, the ocean receding causes the rivers to recede; the rivers
receding cause the streams to recede; the streams receding cause the lakes
to recede; the lakes receding cause the pools to recede. So too, ignorance
receding causes volitional formations to recede; volitional formations
receding cause consciousness to recede ... birth receding causes
aging-and-death to recede.”</p>
