“Bhikkhus, if one’s clothes or head were ablaze, what should be done about
it?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“Venerable sir, if one’s clothes or head were ablaze, to extinguish one’s
blazing clothes or head one should arouse extraordinary desire, make an
extraordinary effort, stir up zeal and enthusiasm, be unremitting, and
exercise mindfulness and clear comprehension.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“Bhikkhus, one might look on equanimously at one’s blazing clothes or head,
paying no attention to them, but so long as one has not made the
breakthrough to the Four Noble Truths as they really are, in order to make
the breakthrough one should arouse extraordinary desire, make an
extraordinary effort, stir up zeal and enthusiasm, be unremitting, and
exercise mindfulness and clear comprehension. What four? The noble truth of
suffering … the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“Therefore, bhikkhus, an exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is
suffering.’… An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the way
leading to the cessation of suffering.’”</p>
