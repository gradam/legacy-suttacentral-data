On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo
Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Now on that occasion the Venerable Assaji was
dwelling at Kassapaka’s Park, sick, afflicted, gravely ill.</p>
<p><span class="add show">As in preceding sutta, down to:</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iii.125"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“Then if you have nothing for which to reproach yourself in regard to
virtue, Assaji, why are you troubled by remorse and regret?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“Formerly, venerable sir, when I was ill I kept on tranquillizing the
bodily formations, but <span class="add show">now</span> I do not obtain
concentration. As I do not obtain concentration, it occurs to me: ‘Let me
not fall away!’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“Those ascetics and brahmins, Assaji, who regard concentration as the
essence and identify concentration with asceticism, failing to obtain
concentration, might think, ‘Let us not fall away!’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
“What do you think, Assaji, is form permanent or impermanent?” -
“Impermanent, venerable sir.”…
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iii.126"></a>
- “Therefore … Seeing thus … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this
state of being.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
“If he feels a pleasant feeling, he understands: ‘It is impermanent’; he
understands: ‘It is not held to’; he understands: ‘It is not delighted in.’
If he feels a painful feeling, he understands: ‘It is impermanent’; he
understands: ‘It is not held to’; he understands: ‘It is not delighted in.’
If he feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he understands: ‘It is
impermanent’; he understands: ‘It is not held to’; he understands: ‘It is
not delighted in.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>
“If he feels a pleasant feeling, he feels it detached; if he feels a
painful feeling, he feels it detached; if he feels a
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he feels it detached.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>
“When he feels a feeling terminating with the body, he understands: ‘I feel
a feeling terminating with the body.’ When he feels a feeling terminating
with life, he understands: ‘I feel a feeling terminating with life.’ He
understands: ‘With the breakup of the body, following the exhaustion of
life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>
“Just as, Assaji, an oil lamp burns in dependence on the oil and the wick,
and with the exhaustion of the oil and the wick it is extinguished through
lack of fuel, so too, Assaji, when a bhikkhu feels a feeling terminating
with the body … terminating with life … He understands: ‘With the breakup of
the body, following the exhaustion of life, all that is felt, not being
delighted in, will become cool right here.’”</p>
