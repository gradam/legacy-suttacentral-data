<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>
On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kimbila on the bank of the
river Ganges. The Blessed One saw a great log being carried along by the
current of the river Ganges, and he addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Do you
see, bhikkhus,
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.182"></a>
that great log being carried along by the current of the river Ganges?”</p>
<p>“Yes, venerable sir.”… <span class="add show">as above</span> …</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
When this was said, the Venerable Kimbila asked the Blessed One: “What,
venerable sir, is the near shore … what is inward rottenness?”</p>
<p class="bracket">
<span class="add show">Replies as above except the following:</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“And what, Kimbila, is inward rottenness? Here, Kimbila, a bhikkhu commits
a certain defiled offence, an offence of a kind that does not allow for
rehabilitation. This is called inward rottenness.”</p>
