<h1>13. Cunda</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapiṇḍika’s Park. Now on that occasion the Venerable Sariputta was dwelling among the Magadhans at Nalakagama—sick, afflicted, gravely ill—and the novice Cunda was his attendant. Then, because of that illness, the Venerable Sariputta attained final Nibbana.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>The novice Cunda, taking the Venerable Sariputta’s bowl and robe, went to Savatthi, to Jeta’s Grove, Anathapiṇḍika’s Park. There he approached the Venerable Ananda, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.162"></a> “Venerable sir, the Venerable Sariputta has attained final Nibbana. This is his bowl and robe.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Friend Cunda, we should see the Blessed One about this piece of news. Come, friend Cunda, let us go to the Blessed One and report this matter to him.”</p>
<p>“Yes, venerable sir,” the novice Cunda replied.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Then the Venerable Ananda and the novice Cunda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Venerable Ananda then said to the Blessed One: “This novice Cunda, venerable sir, says that the Venerable Sariputta has attained final Nibbana, and this is his bowl and robe. Venerable sir, since I heard that the Venerable Sariputta has attained final Nibbana, my body seems as if it has been drugged, I have become disoriented, the teachings are no longer clear to me.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Why, Ananda, when Sariputta attained final Nibbana, did he take away your aggregate of virtue, or your aggregate of concentration, or your aggregate of wisdom, or your aggregate of liberation, or your aggregate of the knowledge and vision of liberation?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“No, he did not, venerable sir. But for me the Venerable Sariputta was an advisor and counsellor, one who instructed, exhorted, inspired, and gladdened me. He was unwearying in teaching the Dhamma; he was helpful to his brothers in the holy life. We recollect the nourishment of Dhamma, the wealth of Dhamma, the help of Dhamma given by the Venerable Sariputta.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“But have I not already declared, Ananda, that we must be parted, separated, and severed from all who are dear and agreeable to us? <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.163"></a> How, Ananda, is it to be obtained here: ‘May what is born, come to be, conditioned, and subject to disintegration not disintegrate!’? That is impossible. It is just as if the largest branch would break off a great tree standing possessed of heartwood: so too, Ananda, in the great Bhikkhu Saṅgha standing possessed of heartwood, Sariputta has attained final Nibbana. How, Ananda, is it to be obtained here: ‘May what is born, come to be, conditioned, and subject to disintegration not disintegrate!’? That is impossible.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“Therefore, Ananda, dwell with yourselves as your own island, with yourselves as your own refuge, with no other refuge; dwell with the Dhamma as your island, with the Dhamma as your refuge, with no other refuge … <span class="add show">as in §9</span> … Those bhikkhus, Ananda, either now or after I am gone, who dwell with themselves as their own island, with themselves as their own refuge, with no other refuge; who dwell with the Dhamma as their island, with the Dhamma as their refuge, with no other refuge—it is these bhikkhus, Ananda, who will be for me topmost of those keen on the training.”</p>
