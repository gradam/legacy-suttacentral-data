<h3>Connected Discourses on the Factors of Enlightenment</h3>
<h1>27. The Cessation of Craving</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, develop the path and the way that leads to the cessation of craving. And what is the path and the way that leads to the cessation of craving? It is: the seven factors of enlightenment. What seven? The enlightenment factor of mindfulness … the enlightenment factor of equanimity.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And how is it, bhikkhus, that the seven factors of enlightenment, when developed and cultivated, lead to the cessation of craving?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness … the enlightenment factor of equanimity, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. It is when the seven factors of enlightenment are developed and cultivated in this way that they lead to the cessation of craving.”</p>
