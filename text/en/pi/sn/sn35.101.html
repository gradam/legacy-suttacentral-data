<h1>101. Not Yours (1)</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, whatever is not yours, abandon it. When you have abandoned it, that will lead to your welfare and happiness. And what is it, bhikkhus, that is not yours? The eye is not yours: abandon it. When you have abandoned it, that will lead to your welfare and happiness. Forms are not yours … Eye-consciousness is not yours … Eye-contact is not yours … Whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is not yours: abandon it. When you have abandoned it, that will lead to your welfare and happiness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“The ear is not yours … <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.82"></a> … The mind is not yours … Whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition … that too is not yours: abandon it. When you have abandoned it, that will lead to your welfare and happiness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Suppose, bhikkhus, people were to carry off the grass, sticks, branches, and foliage in this Jeta’s Grove, or to burn them, or to do with them as they wish. Would you think: ‘People are carrying us off, or burning us, or doing with us as they wish’?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“No, venerable sir. For what reason? Because, venerable sir, that is neither our self nor what belongs to our self.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“So too, bhikkhus, the eye is not yours … Whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition … that too is not yours: abandon it. When you have abandoned it, that will lead to your welfare and happiness.”</p>
