<h1>28. Partaking of Penetration</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the path that partakes of penetration. Listen to that….</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the path that partakes of penetration? It is: the seven factors of enlightenment. What seven? The enlightenment factor of mindfulness … the enlightenment factor of equanimity.”</p>

With a mind that has developed the enlightenment factor of equanimity, he penetrates and sunders the mass of greed ... the mass of hatred ... the mass of delusion that he has never before penetrated and sundered.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“It is, Udayı̄, when the seven factors of enlightenment are developed and cultivated in this way that they lead to penetration.”</p>
