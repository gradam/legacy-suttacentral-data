On one occasion the Venerable Upavaṇa and the Venerable Sariputta were
dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Park. Then, in the evening, the Venerable
Sariputta emerged from seclusion and approached the Venerable Upavaṇa. He
exchanged greetings with the Venerable Upavaṇa and, when they had concluded

“Friend Upavaṇa, can a bhikkhu know for himself: ‘By careful attention the
seven factors of enlightenment have been fully perfected by me in such a way

“A bhikkhu can know this for himself, friend Sariputta. When arousing the
enlightenment factor of mindfulness, friend, a bhikkhu understands: ‘My mind

<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“It is in this way, friend, that a bhikkhu can know for himself: ‘By
careful attention the seven factors of enlightenment have been fully
perfected by me in such a way that they lead to dwelling in comfort.’”</p>
