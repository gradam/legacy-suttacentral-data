“Bhikkhus, there are these five obstructions, hindrances, corruptions of
the mind, weakeners of wisdom. What five? Sensual desire is an obstruction,
a hindrance, a corruption of the mind, a weakener of wisdom. Ill will is an
obstruction … Sloth and torpor are an obstruction …
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.95"></a>
Restlessness and remorse are an obstruction … Doubt is an obstruction … a
weakener of wisdom. These are the five obstructions, hindrances, corruptions
of the mind, weakeners of wisdom.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“There are, bhikkhus, these seven factors of enlightenment, which are
nonobstructions, nonhindrances, noncorruptions of the mind; when developed
and cultivated they lead to the realization of the fruit of true knowledge
and liberation. What seven? The enlightenment factor of mindfulness is a
nonobstruction … The enlightenment factor of equanimity is a
nonobstruction.… These are the seven factors of enlightenment that are
nonobstructions, nonhindrances, noncorruptions of the mind; when developed
and cultivated they lead to the realization of the fruit of true knowledge
and liberation.”</p>
