<h3>Connected Discourses on the Establishments of Mindfulness</h3>
<h1>29. Sirivaḍḍha</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>On one occasion the Venerable Ananda was dwelling at Rajagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Now on that occasion the householder Sirivaḍḍha was sick, afflicted, gravely ill. Then the householder Sirivaḍḍha addressed a man thus:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Come, good man, approach the Venerable Ananda, pay homage to him in my name with your head at his feet, and say: ‘Venerable sir, the householder Sirivaḍḍha is sick, afflicted, gravely ill; he pays homage to the Venerable Ananda with his head at his feet.’ Then say: ‘It would be good, venerable sir, if the Venerable Ananda would come to the residence of the householder Sirivaḍḍha out of compassion.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Yes, master,” that man replied, and he approached the Venerable Ananda, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and delivered his message. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.177"></a> The Venerable Ananda consented by silence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Then, in the morning, the Venerable Ananda dressed and, taking bowl and robe, went to the residence of the householder Sirivaḍḍha. He then sat down in the appointed seat and said to the householder Sirivaḍḍha: “I hope you are bearing up, householder, I hope you are getting better. I hope your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing, and that their subsiding, not their increase, is to be discerned.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“I am not bearing up, venerable sir, I am not getting better. Strong painful feelings are increasing in me, not subsiding, and their increase, not their subsiding, is to be discerned.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Well then, householder, you should train thus: ‘I will dwell contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. I will dwell contemplating feelings in feelings … mind in mind … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world.’ It is in such a way that you should train.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“Venerable sir, as to these four establishments of mindfulness taught by the Blessed One—these things exist in me, and I live in conformity with those things. I dwell, venerable sir, contemplating the body in the body … feelings in feelings … mind in mind … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. And as to these five lower fetters taught by the Blessed One, I do not see any of these unabandoned in myself.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“It is a gain for you, householder! It is well gained by you, householder! You have declared, householder, the fruit of nonreturning.” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.178"></a></p>
