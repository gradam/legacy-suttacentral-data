<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>
Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Baraṇasi
in the Deer Park at Isipatana. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus
thus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“Bhikkhus, by careful attention, by careful right striving, I have arrived
at unsurpassed liberation, I have realized unsurpassed liberation. You too,
bhikkhus, by careful attention, by careful right striving, must arrive at
unsurpassed liberation, must realize unsurpassed liberation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
Then Mara the Evil One approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
“You are bound by Mara’s snare<br>
Both celestial and human;<br>
You are bound by Mara’s bondage:<br>
You won’t escape me, ascetic!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="add show">The Blessed One:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
“I am freed from Mara’s snare<br>
Both celestial and human;<br>
I am freed from Mara’s bondage:<br>
You’re defeated, End-maker!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Mara the Evil One … disappeared right there.</p>
