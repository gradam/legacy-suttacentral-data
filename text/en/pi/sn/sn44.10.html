<h1>10. Ananda <span class="add show">Is There a Self?</span></h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>Then the wanderer Vacchagotta approached the Blessed One ... and said to him:</p>
<p>“How is it now, Master Gotama, is there a self?”</p>
<p>When this was said, the Blessed One was silent.</p>
<p>“Then, Master Gotama, is there no self?”</p>
<p>A second time the Blessed One was silent.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Then the wanderer Vacchagotta rose from his seat and departed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>Then, not long after the wanderer Vacchagotta had left, the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: “Why is it, venerable sir, that when the Blessed One was questioned by the wanderer Vacchagotta, he did not answer?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“If, Ananda, when I was asked by the wanderer Vacchagotta, ‘Is there a self?’ I had answered, ‘There is a self,’ this would have been siding with those ascetics and brahmins who are eternalists. And if, when I was asked by him, ‘Is there no self?’ I had answered, ‘There is no self,’ <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.401"></a> this would have been siding with those ascetics and brahmins who are annihilationists.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“If, Ananda, when I was asked by the wanderer Vacchagotta, ‘Is there a self?’ I had answered, ‘There is a self,’ would this have been consistent on my part with the arising of the knowledge that ‘all phenomena are nonself’?”</p>
<p>“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“And if, when I was asked by him, ‘Is there no self?’ I had answered, ‘There is no self,’ the wanderer Vacchagotta, already confused, would have fallen into even greater confusion, thinking, ‘It seems that the self I formerly had does not exist now.’”</p>
