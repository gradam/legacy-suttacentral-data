<h1>230. The Fisherman Simile</h1>
</hgroup>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>
“Bhikkhus, suppose a fisherman would cast a baited hook into a deep lake,
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.159"></a>
and a fish on the lookout for food would swallow it. That fish who has thus
swallowed the fisherman’s hook would meet with calamity and disaster, and
the fisherman could do with it as he wishes. So too, bhikkhus, there are
these six hooks in the world for the calamity of beings, for the slaughter
of living beings.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“There are, bhikkhus, forms cognizable by the eye that are desirable,
lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. If a bhikkhu
seeks delight in them, welcomes them, and remains holding to them, he is
called a bhikkhu who has swallowed Mara’s hook. He has met with calamity and
disaster, and the Evil One can do with him as he wishes.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“There are, bhikkhus, sounds cognizable by the ear … mental phenomena
cognizable by the mind that are desirable … tantalizing. If a bhikkhu seeks
delight in them … the Evil One can do with him as he wishes.</p>

“There are, bhikkhus, forms cognizable by the eye that are desirable,
lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. If a bhikkhu
does not seek delight in them, does not welcome them, and does not remain
holding to them, he is called a bhikkhu who has not swallowed Mara’s hook,
who has broken the hook, demolished the hook. He has not met with calamity
and disaster, and the Evil One cannot do with him as he wishes.</p>

“There are, bhikkhus, sounds cognizable by the ear … mental phenomena
cognizable by the mind that are desirable … tantalizing. If a bhikkhu does
not seek delight in them … the Evil One cannot do with him as he wishes.”</p>
