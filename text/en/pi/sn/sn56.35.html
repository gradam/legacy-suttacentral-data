“Bhikkhus, suppose there were a man with a life span of a hundred years,
who could live a hundred years. Someone would say to him: ‘Come, good man,
in the morning they will strike you with a hundred spears; at noon they will
strike you with a hundred spears; in the evening they will strike you with a
hundred spears. And you, good man, being struck day after day by three
hundred spears will have a life span of a hundred years, will live a hundred
years; and then, after a hundred years have passed, you will make the
breakthrough to the Four Noble Truths, to which you had not broken through
earlier.’
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.441"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“It is fitting, bhikkhus, for a clansman intent on his good to accept the
offer. For what reason? Because this saṃsara is without discoverable
beginning; a first point cannot be discerned of blows by spears, blows by
swords, blows by axes. And even though this may be so, bhikkhus, I do not
say that the breakthrough to the Four Noble Truths is accompanied by
suffering or displeasure. Rather, the breakthrough to the Four Noble Truths
is accompanied only by happiness and joy. What four? The noble truth of
suffering … the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“Therefore, bhikkhus, an exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is
suffering.’… An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the way
leading to the cessation of suffering.’”</p>
