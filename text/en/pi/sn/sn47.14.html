<h3>Connected Discourses on the Establishments of Mindfulness</h3>
<h1>14. Ukkacela</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Vajjians at Ukkacela on the bank of the river Ganges, together with a great Bhikkhu Saṅgha, not long after Sariputta and Moggallana had attained final Nibbana. Now on that occasion the Blessed One was sitting in the open air in the midst of the Bhikkhu Saṅgha.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Then the Blessed One, having surveyed the silent Bhikkhu Saṅgha, addressed the bhikkhus thus: <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.164"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Bhikkhus, this assembly appears to me empty now that Sariputta and Moggallana have attained final Nibbana. This assembly was not empty for me <span class="add show">earlier</span>, and I had no concern for whatever quarter Sariputta and Moggallana were dwelling in.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“The Arahants, the Perfectly Enlightened Ones, who arose in the past also had just such a supreme pair of disciples as I had in Sariputta and Moggallana. The Arahants, the Perfectly Enlightened Ones, who will arise in the future will also have just such a supreme pair of disciples as I had in Sariputta and Moggallana.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“It is wonderful, bhikkhus, on the part of the disciples, it is amazing on the part of the disciples, that they will act in accordance with the Teacher’s instructions and comply with his admonitions, that they will be dear and agreeable to the four assemblies, that they will be revered and esteemed by them. It is wonderful, bhikkhus, on the part of the Tathagata, it is amazing on the part of the Tathagata, that when such a pair of disciples has attained final Nibbana, there is no sorrow or lamentation in the Tathagata.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“How, bhikkhus, is it to be obtained here: ‘May what is born, come to be, conditioned, and subject to disintegration not disintegrate! ’? That is impossible. It is just as if the largest branches would break off a great tree standing possessed of heartwood: so too, bhikkhus, in the great Bhikkhu Saṅgha standing possessed of heartwood, Sariputta and Moggallana have attained final Nibbana. How, bhikkhus, is it to be obtained here: ‘May what is born, come to be, conditioned, and subject to disintegration not disintegrate!’? That is impossible.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“Therefore, bhikkhus, dwell with yourselves as your own island, with yourselves as your own refuge, with no other refuge; dwell with the Dhamma as your island, with the Dhamma as your refuge, with no other refuge … <span class="add show">as in §9</span> … <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.165"></a> Those bhikkhus, either now or after I am gone, who dwell with themselves as their own island, with themselves as their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the Dhamma as their island, with the Dhamma as their refuge, with no other refuge—it is these bhikkhus who will be for me topmost of those keen on the training.”</p>
