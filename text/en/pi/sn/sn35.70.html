Then the Venerable Upavaṇa approached the Blessed One … and said to him:
“Venerable sir, it is said, ‘the directly visible</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
Dhamma, the directly visible Dhamma.’ In what way, venerable sir, is the
Dhamma directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see,
applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“Here, Upavaṇa, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu experiences the
form as well as lust for the form. He understands that lust for forms exists
internally thus: ‘There is in me lust for forms internally.’ Since that is
so, Upavaṇa, the Dhamma is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come
and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.

<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“Further, Upavaṇa, having heard a sound with the ear … having cognized a
mental phenomenon with the mind, a bhikkhu experiences the mental phenomenon
as well as lust for the mental phenomenon. He understands that lust for
mental phenomena exists internally thus: ‘There is in me lust for mental
phenomena internally.’ Since that is so, Upavaṇa, the Dhamma is directly
visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be
personally experienced by the wise.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
“But here, Upavaṇa, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu experiences
the form without experiencing lust for the form. He understands that lust
for forms does not exist internally thus: ‘There is in me no lust for forms
internally.’ Since that is so, Upavaṇa, the Dhamma is directly visible,
immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally
experienced by the wise.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
“Further, Upavaṇa, having heard a sound with the ear …
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.43"></a>
… having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, a bhikkhu experiences
the mental phenomenon without experiencing lust for the mental phenomenon.
He understands that lust for mental phenomena does not exist internally
thus: ‘There is in me no lust for mental phenomena internally.’ Since that
is so, Upavaṇa, the Dhamma is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to
come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.”</p>
