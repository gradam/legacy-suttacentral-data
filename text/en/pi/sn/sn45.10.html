At Savatthī. Then the wanderer Nandiya approached the Blessed One and
exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and
cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One: “How many
things, Master Gotama, when developed and cultivated, lead to Nibbana, have
Nibbana as their destination, Nibbana as their final goal?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“These eight things, Nandiya, when developed and cultivated, lead to
Nibbana, have Nibbana as their destination, Nibbana as their final goal.
What eight? Right view ... right concentration. These eight things, when
developed and cultivated, lead to Nibbana, have Nibbana as their
destination, Nibbana as their final goal.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
When this was said, the wanderer Nandiya said to the Blessed One:
“Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.12"></a>
Gotama!… From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has
gone for refuge for life.”</p>
