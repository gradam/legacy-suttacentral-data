On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sumbhas, where there
was a town of the Sumbhas named Sedaka. There the Blessed One addressed the
bhikkhus thus:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“Bhikkhus, once in the past an acrobat set up his bamboo pole and addressed
his apprentice Medakathalika thus: ‘Come, dear Medakathalika, climb the
bamboo pole and stand on my shoulders.’ Having replied, ‘Yes, teacher,’ the
apprentice Medakathalika climbed up the bamboo pole and stood on the
teacher’s shoulders. The acrobat then said to the apprentice Medakathalika:
‘You protect me, dear Medakathalika, and I’ll protect you. Thus
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.169"></a>
guarded by one another, protected by one another, we’ll display our skills,
collect our fee, and get down safely from the bamboo pole.’ When this was
said, the apprentice Medakathalika replied: ‘That’s not the way to do it,
teacher. You protect yourself, teacher, and I’ll protect myself. Thus, each
self-guarded and self-protected, we’ll display our skills, collect our fee,
and get down safely from the bamboo pole.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“That’s the method there,” the Blessed One said. “It’s just as the
apprentice Medakathalika said to the teacher. ‘I will protect myself,’
bhikkhus: thus should the establishments of mindfulness be practised. ‘I
will protect others,’ bhikkhus: thus should the establishments of
mindfulness be practised. Protecting oneself, bhikkhus, one protects others;
protecting others, one protects oneself.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“And how is it, bhikkhus, that by protecting oneself one protects others?
By the pursuit, development, and cultivation
<span class="add show">of the four establishments of mindfulness</span>. It
is in such a way that by protecting oneself one protects others.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
“And how is it, bhikkhus, that by protecting others one protects oneself?
By patience, harmlessness, lovingkindness, and sympathy. It is in such a way
that by protecting others one protects oneself.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
“‘I will protect myself,’ bhikkhus: thus should the establishments of
mindfulness be practised. ‘I will protect others,’ bhikkhus: thus should the
establishments of mindfulness be practised. Protecting oneself, bhikkhus,
one protects others; protecting others, one protects oneself.”</p>
