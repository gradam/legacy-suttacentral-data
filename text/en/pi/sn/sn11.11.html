<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthī. “Bhikkhus, in the past, when Sakka, lord of the devas, was a human being, he adopted and undertook seven vows by the undertaking of which he achieved the status of Sakka. What were the seven vows?</p>
<p>(1) “‘As long as I live may I support my parents.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>(2) “‘As long as I live may I respect the family elders.’</p>
<p>(3) “‘As long as I live may I speak gently.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>(4) “‘As long as I live may I not speak divisively.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>(5) “‘As long as I live may I dwell at home with a mind devoid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, delighting in relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing.’</p>
<p>(6) “‘As long as I live may I speak the truth.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>(7) “‘As long as I live may I be free from anger, and if anger should arise in me may I dispel it quickly.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“In the past, bhikkhus, when Sakka, lord of the devas, was a human being, he adopted and undertook these seven vows by the undertaking of which he achieved the status of Sakka.</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a> “When a person supports his parents,<br>
And respects the family elders;<br>
When his speech is gentle and courteous,<br>
And he refrains from divisive words;</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a> When he strives to remove meanness,<br>
Is truthful, and vanquishes anger,<br>
The Tavatiṃsa devas call him<br>
Truly a superior person.” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.i.229"></a></p>
