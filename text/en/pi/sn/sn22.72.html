At Savatthi. Then the Venerable Suradha approached the Blessed One … and
said to him:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“Venerable sir, how should one know, how should one see so that, in regard
to this body with consciousness and in regard to all external signs, the
mind is rid of I-making, mine-making, and conceit, has transcended
discrimination, and is peaceful and well liberated?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“Any kind of form whatsoever, Suradha, whether past, future, or present …
far or near—having seen all form as it really is with correct wisdom thus:
‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self,’ one is liberated by
nonclinging.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“Any kind of feeling whatsoever … Any kind of perception whatsoever … Any
kind of volitional formations whatsoever …
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iii.81"></a>
Any kind of consciousness whatsoever, whether past, future, or present,
internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or
near—having seen all consciousness as it really is with correct wisdom thus:
‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self,’ one is liberated by
nonclinging.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
“When one knows and sees thus, Suradha, then in regard to this body with
consciousness and in regard to all external signs, the mind is rid of
I-making, mine-making, and conceit, has transcended discrimination, and is
peaceful and well liberated.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
Then the Venerable Suradha … became one of the arahants.</p>
