“Bhikkhus, suppose a tree were slanting, sloping, and inclining towards the
east. If it were cut at its foot, in what direction would it fall?”
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.48"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“In whatever direction it was slanting, sloping, and inclining, venerable
sir.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“So too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who develops and cultivates the Noble
Eightfold Path slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbana.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“And how does a bhikkhu do so? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right
view ... right concentration, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and
cessation, maturing in release. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu
develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path so that he slants, slopes,
and inclines towards Nibbana.”</p>
