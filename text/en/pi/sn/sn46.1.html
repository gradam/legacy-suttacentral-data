At Savatthī. “Bhikkhus, based upon the Himalayas, the king of mountains,
the nagas nurture their bodies and acquire strength. When they have nurtured
their bodies and acquired strength, they then enter the pools. From the
pools they enter the lakes, then the streams, then the rivers, and finally
they enter the ocean. There they achieve greatness and expansiveness of
body. So too, bhikkhus, based upon virtue, established upon virtue, a
bhikkhu develops and cultivates the seven factors of enlightenment, and
thereby he achieves greatness and expansiveness in
<span class="add show">wholesome</span> states.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“And how does a bhikkhu, based upon virtue, established upon virtue,
develop the seven factors of enlightenment? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu
develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness, which is based upon
seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release.
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.64"></a>
He develops the enlightenment factor of discrimination of states … the
enlightenment factor of energy … the enlightenment factor of rapture … the
enlightenment factor of tranquillity … the enlightenment factor of
concentration … the enlightenment factor of equanimity, which is based upon
seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. It is in this
way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu, based upon virtue, established upon virtue,
develops the seven factors of enlightenment, and thereby achieves greatness
and expansiveness in <span class="add show">wholesome</span> states.”</p>
