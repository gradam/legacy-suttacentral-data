“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of nutriment for the maintenance of
beings that have already come to be and for the assistance of those about to
come to be. What four? The nutriment edible food, gross or subtle; second,
contact; third, mental volition; fourth, consciousness. These are the four
kinds of nutriment for the maintenance of beings that have already come to
be and for the assistance of those about to come to be.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“And how, bhikkhus, should the nutriment edible food be seen? Suppose a
couple, husband and wife, had taken limited provisions and were travelling
through a desert. They have with them their only son, dear and beloved.
Then, in the middle of the desert, their limited provisions would be used up
and exhausted, while the rest of the desert remains to be crossed. The
husband and wife would think: ‘Our limited provisions have been used up and
exhausted, while the rest of this desert remains to be crossed. Let us kill
our only son, dear and beloved, and prepare dried and spiced meat. By eating
our son’s flesh we can cross the rest of this desert. Let not all three of
us perish!’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“Then, bhikkhus, the husband and wife would kill their only son, dear and
beloved, prepare dried and spiced meat, and by eating their son’s flesh they
would cross the rest of the desert. While they are eating their son’s flesh,
they would beat their breasts and cry: ‘Where are you, our only son? Where
are you, our only son?’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“What do you think, bhikkhus? Would they eat that food for amusement or for
enjoyment
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.99"></a>
or for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness?”</p>
<p>“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
“Wouldn’t they eat that food only for the sake of crossing the desert?”</p>
<p>“Yes, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
“It is in such a way, bhikkhus, that I say the nutriment edible food should
be seen. When the nutriment edible food is fully understood, lust for the
five cords of sensual pleasure is fully understood. When lust for the five
cords of sensual pleasure is fully understood, there is no fetter bound by
which a noble disciple might come back again to this world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>
“And how, bhikkhus, should the nutriment contact be seen? Suppose there is
a flayed cow. If she stands exposed to a wall, the creatures dwelling in the
wall would nibble at her. If she stands exposed to a tree, the creatures
dwelling in the tree would nibble at her. If she stands exposed to water,
the creatures dwelling in the water would nibble at her. If she stands
exposed to the open air, the creatures dwelling in the open air would nibble
at her. Whatever that flayed cow stands exposed to, the creatures dwelling
there would nibble at her.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>
“It is in such a way, bhikkhus, that I say the nutriment contact should be
seen. When the nutriment contact is fully understood, the three kinds of
feeling are fully understood. When the three kinds of feeling are fully
understood, I say, there is nothing further that a noble disciple needs to
do.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>
“And how, bhikkhus, should the nutriment mental volition be seen? Suppose
there is a charcoal pit deeper than a man’s height, filled with glowing
coals without flame or smoke. A man would come along wanting to live, not
wanting to die, desiring happiness and averse to suffering. Then two strong
men would grab him by both arms and drag him towards the charcoal pit. The
man’s volition would be to get far away, his longing would be to get far
away, his wish would be to get far away
<span class="add show">from the charcoal pit</span>.
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.100"></a>
For what reason? Because he knows: ‘I will fall into this charcoal pit and
on that account I will meet death or deadly suffering.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>
“It is in such a way, bhikkhus, that I say the nutriment mental volition
should be seen. When the nutriment mental volition is fully understood, the
three kinds of craving are fully understood. When the three kinds of craving
are fully understood, I say, there is nothing further that a noble disciple
needs to do.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>
“And how, bhikkhus, should the nutriment consciousness be seen? Suppose
they were to arrest a bandit, a criminal, and bring him before the king,
saying: ‘Sire, this man is a bandit, a criminal. Impose on him whatever
punishment you wish.’ The king says to them: ‘Go, men, in the morning strike
this man with a hundred spears.’ In the morning they strike him with a
hundred spears. Then at noon the king asks: ‘Men, how’s that man?’–‘Still
alive, sire.’–‘Then go, and at noon strike him with a hundred spears.’ At
noon they strike him with a hundred spears. Then in the evening the king
asks: ‘Men, how’s that man?’–‘Still alive, sire.’ –‘Then go, and in the
evening strike him with a hundred spears.’ In the evening they strike him
with a hundred spears.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>
“What do you think, bhikkhus? Would that man, being struck with three
hundred spears, experience pain and displeasure on that account?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>
“Venerable sir, even if he were struck with one spear he would experience
pain and displeasure on that account, not to speak of three hundred spears.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a>
“It is in such a way, bhikkhus, that I say the nutriment consciousness
should be seen. When the nutriment consciousness is fully understood,
name-and-form is fully understood. When name-and-form is fully understood, I
say, there is nothing further that a noble disciple needs to do.”
