<p>Connected Discourses on the Six Sense Bases</p>
<h1>94. Untamed, Unguarded</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthi. “Bhikkhus, these six bases for contact—if untamed, unguarded, unprotected, unrestrained—are bringers of suffering. What six?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“The eye, bhikkhus, as a base for contact—if untamed, unguarded, unprotected, unrestrained—is a bringer of suffering. The ear as a base for contact … The mind as a base for contact … is a bringer of suffering. These six bases for contact—if untamed, unguarded, unprotected, unrestrained—are bringers of suffering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Bhikkhus, these six bases for contact—if well tamed, well guarded, well protected, well restrained—are bringers of happiness. What six?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“The eye, bhikkhus, as a base for contact—if well tamed, well guarded, well protected, well restrained—is a bringer of happiness. The ear as a base for contact … The mind as a base for contact … is a bringer of happiness. These six bases for contact—if well tamed, well guarded, well protected, well restrained—are bringers of happiness.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Just six, O bhikkhus, are the bases for contact,<br>
Where one unrestrained meets with suffering.<br>
Those who know how to restrain them<br>
Dwell uncorrupted, with faith their partner.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“Having seen forms that delight the mind<br>
And having seen those that give no delight,<br>
Dispel the path of lust towards the delightful<br>
And do not soil the mind by thinking,<br>
‘<span class="add show">The other</span> is displeasing to me.’ <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.71"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“Having heard sounds both pleasant and raucous,<br>
Do not be enthralled with pleasant sound.<br>
Dispel the course of hate towards the raucous,<br>
And do not soil the mind by thinking,<br>
‘<span class="add show">This one</span> is displeasing to me.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“Having smelt a fragrant, delightful scent,<br>
And having smelt a putrid stench,<br>
Dispel aversion towards the stench<br>
And do not yield to desire for the lovely.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>“Having enjoyed a sweet delicious taste,<br>
And having sometimes tasted what is bitter,<br>
Do not greedily enjoy the sweet taste,<br>
Do not feel aversion towards the bitter.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>“When touched by pleasant contact do not be enthralled,<br>
Do not tremble when touched by pain.<br>
Look evenly on both the pleasant and painful,<br>
Not drawn or repelled by anything.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>“When common people of proliferated perception<br>
Perceive and proliferate they become engaged.<br>
Having dispelled every mind-state bound to the home life,<br>
One travels on the road of renunciation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>“When the mind is thus well developed in six,<br>
If touched, one’s mind never flutters anywhere.<br>
Having vanquished both lust and hate, O bhikkhus,<br>
Go to the far shore beyond birth and death!” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.72"></a></p>
