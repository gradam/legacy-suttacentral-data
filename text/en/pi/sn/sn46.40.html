<h3>Connected Discourses on the Factors of Enlightenment</h3>
<h1>40. Hindrances</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, these five hindrances are makers of blindness, causing lack of vision, causing lack of knowledge, detrimental to wisdom, tending to vexation, leading away from Nibbana. What five? The hindrance of sensual desire is a maker of blindness … The hindrance of ill will … The hindrance of sloth and torpor ... The hindrance of restlessness and remorse … The hindrance of doubt is a maker of blindness … leading away from Nibbana. These five hindrances are makers of blindness, causing lack of vision, causing lack of knowledge, detrimental to wisdom, tending to vexation, leading away from Nibbana.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“These seven factors of enlightenment, bhikkhus, are makers of vision, makers of knowledge, promoting the growth of wisdom, free from vexation, leading towards Nibbana. What seven? The enlightenment factor of mindfulness is a maker of vision ... The enlightenment factor of equanimity is a maker of vision ... leading towards Nibbana. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.98"></a> These seven factors of enlightenment are makers of vision, makers of knowledge, promoting the growth of wisdom, free from vexation, leading towards Nibbana.”</p>
