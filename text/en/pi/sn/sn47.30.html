</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>The same setting. Now on that occasion the householder Manadinna was sick, afflicted, gravely ill. Then the householder Manadinna addressed a man thus:</p>
<p>“Come, good man” … <span class="add show">as above</span> …</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“I am not bearing up, venerable sir, I am not getting better. Strong painful feelings are increasing in me, not subsiding, and their increase, not their subsiding, is to be discerned. But, venerable sir, when I am being touched by such painful feeling, I dwell contemplating the body in the body … feelings in feelings … mind in mind … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. And as to these five lower fetters taught by the Blessed One, I do not see any of these unabandoned in myself.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“It is a gain for you, householder! It is well gained by you, householder! You have declared, householder, the fruit of nonreturning.”</p>
