<h3>Connected Discourses on the Factors of Enlightenment</h3>
<h1>16. Ill (3)</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Now on that occasion the Blessed One was sick, afflicted, gravely ill. Then the Venerable Mahacunda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to the Venerable Mahacunda:</p>
<p>“Recite the factors of enlightenment, Cunda.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“These seven factors of enlightenment, venerable sir, have been rightly expounded by the Blessed One; when developed and cultivated, they lead to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana. What seven? The enlightenment factor of mindfulness has been rightly expounded by the Blessed One; when developed and cultivated, it leads to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana…. The enlightenment factor of equanimity has been rightly expounded by the Blessed One; when developed and cultivated, it leads to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana. These seven factors of enlightenment, venerable sir, have been rightly expounded by the Blessed One; when developed and cultivated, they lead to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Surely, Cunda, they are factors of enlightenment! Surely, Cunda, they are factors of enlightenment!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>This is what the Venerable Mahacunda said. The Teacher approved. And the Blessed One recovered from that illness. In such a way the Blessed One was cured of his illness.</p>
