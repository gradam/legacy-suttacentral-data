On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha on Mount Vulture
Peak. Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Come, bhikkhus, let
us go to Paṭibhana Peak for the day’s abiding.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied.
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.449"></a>
Then the Blessed One, together with a number of bhikkhus, went to Paṭibhana
Peak. A certain bhikkhu saw the steep precipice off Paṭibhana Peak and said
to the Blessed One: “That precipice is indeed steep, venerable sir; that
precipice is extremely frightful. But is there, venerable sir, any other
precipice steeper and more frightful than that one?”</p>
<p>“There is, bhikkhu.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“But what, venerable sir, is that precipice steeper and more frightful than
that one?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“Those ascetics and brahmins, bhikkhu, who do not understand as it really
is: ‘This is suffering’; who do not understand as it really is: ‘This is the
origin of suffering’; who do not understand as it really is: ‘This is the
cessation of suffering’; who do not understand as it really is: ‘This is the
way leading to the cessation of suffering’—they delight in volitional
formations that lead to birth, in volitional formations that lead to aging,
in volitional formations that lead to death, in volitional formations that
lead to sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. Delighting in
such volitional formations, they generate volitional formations that lead to
birth, generate volitional formations that lead to aging, generate
volitional formations that lead to death, generate volitional formations
that lead to sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. Having
generated such volitional formations, they tumble down the precipice of
birth, tumble down the precipice of aging, tumble down the precipice of
death, tumble down the precipice of sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure,
and despair. They are not freed from birth, aging, and death; not freed from
sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; not freed from
suffering, I say.

“But, bhikkhu, those ascetics and brahmins who understand as it really is:
‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of
suffering’—they do not delight in volitional formations that lead to birth,
nor in volitional formations that lead to aging, nor in volitional
formations that lead to death, nor in volitional formations that lead to
sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. Not delighting in such
volitional formations, they do not generate volitional formations that lead
to birth, nor generate volitional formations that lead to aging, nor
generate volitional formations that lead to death, nor generate volitional
formations that lead to sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair.
Not having generated such volitional formations, they do not tumble down the
precipice of birth, nor tumble down the precipice of aging, nor tumble down
the precipice of death, nor tumble down the precipice of sorrow,
lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. They are freed from birth,
aging, and death; freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and
despair; freed from suffering, I say.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
“Therefore, bhikkhus, an exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is
suffering.’… An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the way
leading to the cessation of suffering.’”</p>
