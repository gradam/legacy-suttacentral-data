“Bhikkhus, Uddaka Ramaputta used to make this declaration:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“‘This, surely a knowledge-master—<br>
This, surely a universal conqueror—<br>
This, surely he has excised<br>
The tumour’s root not excised before!’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“Bhikkhus, though Uddaka Ramaputta was not himself a knowledge-master, he
declared: ‘I am a knowledge-master.’ Though he was not himself a universal
conqueror, he declared: ‘I am a universal conqueror.’ Though he had not
excised the tumour’s root, he declared: ‘I have excised the tumour’s root.’
But here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu speaking rightly might say:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“‘This, surely a knowledge-master—<br>
This, surely a universal conqueror—<br>
This, surely he has excised<br>
The tumour’s root not excised before!’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
“And how, bhikkhus, is one a knowledge-master? When a bhikkhu understands
as they really are the origin, the passing away, the gratification, the
danger, and the escape in regard to the six bases for contact, such a
bhikkhu is a knowledge-master.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
“And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu a universal conqueror? When, having
understood as they really are the origin, the passing away, the
gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to the six bases for
contact, a bhikkhu is liberated by nonclinging, such a bhikkhu is a
universal conqueror.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>
“And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu excise the tumour’s root not excised
before? ‘The tumour,’ bhikkhus: this is a designation for this body
consisting of the four great elements, originating from mother and father,
built up out of rice and gruel, subject to impermanence, to rubbing and
pressing, to breaking apart and dispersal. ‘The tumour’s root’: this is a
designation for craving. When craving has been abandoned by a bhikkhu, cut
off at the root,
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.84"></a>
made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future
arising, in such a case the bhikkhu has excised the tumour’s root not
excised before.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>
“Bhikkhus, though Uddaka Ramaputta was not himself a knowledge-master, he
declared: ‘I am a knowledge-master.’… But here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu speaking
rightly might say:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>
“‘This, surely a knowledge-master—<br>
This, surely a universal conqueror—<br>
This, surely he has excised<br>
The tumour’s root not excised before!’”</p>
