At Savatthi. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“Bhikkhus, on one occasion I was dwelling at Uruvela on the bank of the
river Nerañjara under the Goatherd’s Banyan Tree just after I became fully
enlightened. Then, while I was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in my
mind thus: ‘This is the one-way path for the purification of beings, for the
overcoming of sorrow and lamentation …
<span class="add show">as in §18</span> … that is, the four establishments
of mindfulness.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“Then, bhikkhus, Brahma Sahampati, having known with his own mind the
reflection in my mind, just as quickly as a strong man might extend his
drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, disappeared from the brahma world
and reappeared before me. He arranged his upper robe over one shoulder,
extended his joined hands towards me in reverential salutation, and said to
me: ‘So it is, Blessed One! So it is, Fortunate One! Venerable sir, this is
the one-way path for the purification of beings …
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.186"></a>
… that is, the four establishments of mindfulness.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“This, bhikkhus, is what Brahma Sahampati said. Having said this, he
further said this:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
“‘The seer of the destruction of birth,<br>
Compassionate, knows the one-way path<br>
By which in the past they crossed the flood,<br>
By which they will cross and cross over now.’”</p>
</blockquote>
