“Bhikkhus, just as various winds blow in the sky—easterly winds, westerly
winds, northerly winds, southerly winds, dusty winds and dustless winds,
cold winds and hot winds, gentle winds and strong winds —so too, when a
bhikkhu develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path, then for him the
four establishments of mindfulness go to fulfilment by development; the four
right strivings go to fulfilment by development; the four bases for
spiritual power go to fulfilment by development; the five spiritual
faculties go to fulfilment by development; the five powers go to fulfilment
by development; the seven factors of enlightenment go to fulfilment by
development.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
“And how is this so? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view ...
right concentration, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and
cessation, maturing in release. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that when a
bhikkhu
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.50"></a>
develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path, then for him the four
establishments of mindfulness … the seven factors of enlightenment go to
fulfilment by development.”</p>
