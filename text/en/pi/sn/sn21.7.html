<span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed
One was dwelling at Vesali in the Great Wood in the Hall with the Peaked
Roof. Now on that occasion the Venerable Visakha Pañcaliputta was
instructing, exhorting, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus in the
assembly hall with a Dhamma talk, <span class="add show">spoken</span> with
speech that was polished, clear, articulate, expressing well the meaning,
comprehensive, unattached.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and approached
the assembly hall. He sat down in the appointed seat and addressed the
bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus, who has been instructing, exhorting, inspiring,
and gladdening the bhikkhus in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk,
<span class="add show">spoken</span> with speech that is polished, clear,
articulate, expressing well the meaning, comprehensive, unattached?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“It was this Venerable Visakha Pañcaliputta, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Visakha Pañcaliputta thus:
“Good, good, Visakha! It is good that you thus instruct the bhikkhus with a
Dhamma talk.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
This is what the Blessed One said … <span class="add show">who</span>
further said this:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
“When the wise man is in the midst of fools<br>
They do not know him if he does not speak,<br>
But they know him when he speaks,<br>
Pointing out the deathless state.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>
“He should speak and explain the Dhamma, <br>
He should raise high the seers’ banner.<br>
Well-spoken words are the seers’ banner:<br>
For the Dhamma is the banner of seers.”
<a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.281"></a></p>
