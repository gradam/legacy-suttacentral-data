“Bhikkhus, attend carefully to form. Recognize the impermanence of form as
it really is. When a bhikkhu attends carefully to form and recognizes the
impermanence of form as it really is, he experiences revulsion towards form.
With the destruction of delight comes the destruction of lust; with the
destruction of lust comes the destruction of delight. With the destruction
of delight and lust the mind is liberated and is said to be well liberated.</p>

“Bhikkhus, attend carefully to feeling … to perception … to volitional
formations … to consciousness…. With the destruction of delight and lust the
mind is liberated and is said to be well liberated.”
