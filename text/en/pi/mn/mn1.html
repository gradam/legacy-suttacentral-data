and attend closely to what I shall say.”—“Yes, venerable sir,” the bhikkhus

Because he has understood that delight is the root of suffering, and that
with being <span class="add show">as condition</span> there is birth, and
that for whatever has come to be there is ageing and death. Therefore,
bhikkhus, through the complete destruction, fading away, cessation, giving

full enlightenment, I say.</p>
