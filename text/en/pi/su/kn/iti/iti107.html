<h1>107. Very Helpful</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, brahmins and householders are very helpful to you. They provide you with the requisites of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicine in time of sickness. And you, bhikkhus, are very helpful to brahmins and householders, as you teach them the Dhamma that is good at the outset, good in the middle, and good at the end, with its correct meaning and wording, and you proclaim the holy life in its fulfilment and complete purity. Thus, bhikkhus, this holy life is lived with mutual support for the purpose of crossing the flood and making a complete end of suffering.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Householders and homeless alike,<br>
Each a support for the other,<br>
Both accomplish the true Dhamma—<br>
The unsurpassed security from bondage.</p>
<p>From householders the homeless receive<br>
These basic necessities of life,<br>
Robes to wear and a place to dwell<br>
Dispelling the hardships of the seasons.</p>
<p>And by relying on one of good conduct,<br>
Home-loving layfolk dwelling in a house<br>
Place faith in those worthy ones<br>
Of noble wisdom and meditative.</p>
<p>Practising the Dhamma in this life,<br>
The path leading to a good bourn,<br>
Those wishing for pleasure rejoice<br>
In the delights of the deva world.</p>
