<h1>30. Remorse</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“There are two things, bhikkhus, causing remorse. What are the two? Here someone has not done what is good, not done what is wholesome, not done what is beneficial, but has done evil, callous, wrongful deeds. He is remorseful on thinking, ‘I have not done good,’ and is remorseful on thinking, ‘I have done evil.’ These, bhikkhus, are the two things causing remorse.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Having performed misconduct<br>
By body, misconduct by speech,<br>
Misconduct by mind, and whatever else<br>
Is reckoned a fault—</p>
<p>Not having done a good deed<br>
And done much that is bad—<br>
When his body perishes<br>
That foolish one is reborn in hell.</p>
