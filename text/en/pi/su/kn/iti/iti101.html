<h1>101. Easily Obtained</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“These four, bhikkhus, are trifling things, easily obtained and blameless. What four? A robe made of cast-off rags is a trifling thing, easily obtained and blameless. Food gathered on alms round is a trifling thing, easily obtained and blameless. The root of a tree as a dwelling place is a trifling thing, easily obtained and blameless. Medicine consisting of putrid cow urine is a trifling thing, easily obtained and blameless. These, bhikkhus, are the four trifling things, easily obtained and blameless. When a bhikkhu is content with these things that are trifling and easily obtained, I say of him that he has the requisites for recluseship.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>One content with what is blameless,<br>
Things trifling and easily obtained,<br>
Does not become vexed in mind<br>
When not obtaining a place to live,<br>
A robe to wear, and food and drink;<br>
He has no resentment in any quarter.</p>
<p>These are the things declared to be<br>
Suitable for a recluse’s life<br>
By possession of which a bhikkhu<br>
May abide content and diligent.</p>
