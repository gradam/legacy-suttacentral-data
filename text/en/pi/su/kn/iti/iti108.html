<h1>108 Deceitful</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, whatever bhikkhus are deceitful, stubborn, mere talkers, frauds, arrogant, and unconcentrated, these bhikkhus are no followers of mine. They have turned aside from this Dhamma-and-Discipline and will not achieve growth, progress, or development within it.</p>
<p>“But whatever bhikkhus are not deceitful, not mere talkers, wise, adaptable, and well concentrated, these bhikkhus are indeed my followers. They have not turned aside from this Dhamma-and-Discipline and will achieve growth, progress, and development within it.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Deceitful, stubborn, mere talkers,<br>
Frauds, arrogant, unconcentrated—<br>
These make no progress in the Dhamma<br>
Taught by the Fully Enlightened One.</p>
<p>Undeceitful, not talkative, wise,<br>
Adaptable, well concentrated—<br>
Such as these progress in the Dhamma<br>
Taught by the Fully Enlightened One.</p>
