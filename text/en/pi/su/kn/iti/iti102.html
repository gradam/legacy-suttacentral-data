<h1>102. The Destruction of the Taints</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“For one knowing and seeing, bhikkhus, I say there is the destruction of the taints, not for one not knowing and not seeing. But for one knowing what, seeing what, is there the destruction of the taints? For one knowing and seeing, ‘This is suffering,’ there is the destruction of the taints. For one knowing and seeing, ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the course leading to the cessation of suffering,’ there is the destruction of the taints. Thus it is, bhikkhus, that for one knowing and seeing there is the destruction of the taints.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>For a learner who is training<br>
In conformity with the direct path,<br>
The knowledge of destruction arises first,<br>
And final knowledge immediately follows.</p>
<p>To one freed by that final knowledge,<br>
The topmost knowledge of freedom,<br>
There arises the knowledge of destruction:<br>
“Thus the fetters are destroyed.”</p>
<p>Certainly not by the lazy person<br>
Nor by the uncomprehending fool<br>
Is Nibbāna to be attained,<br>
The loosening of all worldly ties.</p>
