<h1>78 Like Elements</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, it is according to like elements that beings associate with each other and come together. Beings of low disposition associate and come together with beings of low disposition. Beings of good disposition associate and come together with beings of good disposition. It was so in the past, it will be so in the future, and it is so in the present.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Desire born of association<br>
Is severed by non-association.<br>
As one riding on a wooden plank<br>
Would sink in the mighty ocean,<br>
Even so one of virtuous life<br>
Sinks by consorting with an idler.</p>
<p>Therefore shun an idle person,<br>
One who makes little effort.<br>
Live with those who dwell secluded,<br>
The noble ones resolved and meditative,<br>
Who are ever strenuous and wise.</p>
