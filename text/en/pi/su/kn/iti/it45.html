<h1>45 Living in Seclusion</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Live enjoying seclusion, bhikkhus; live delighting in seclusion, engage in practising inner mental tranquillity, not neglecting meditation, possessing insight, and frequenting empty places. If you live enjoying seclusion, bhikkhus, … and frequenting empty places, one of two fruits is to be expected: final knowledge here and now or, there being some residual defilement, the state of non-returning.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Those of peaceful mind, discerning,<br>
Mindful, given to meditation,<br>
Clearly see things rightly<br>
And long not for sensual pleasures.</p>
<p>Those peaceful ones, delighting in diligence,<br>
Who see fear in negligence,<br>
Are incapable of falling away<br>
And are close to Nibbāna.</p>
