<h1>110. While Walking</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, if while walking a sensual thought or a thought of ill will or an aggressive thought arises in a bhikkhu, and if he tolerates it and does not reject it, does not dispel it and get rid of it and bring it to an end, that bhikkhu—who in such a manner is lacking in ardour and unafraid of wrongdoing—is called constantly lazy and indolent. If while standing … If while sitting … If while lying down a sensual thought or a thought of ill will or an aggressive thought arises in a bhikkhu, and if he tolerates it and does not reject it … that bhikkhu is called constantly lazy and indolent.</p>
<p>“But if while walking … standing … sitting … lying down a sensual thought or a thought of ill will or an aggressive thought arises in a bhikkhu and he does not tolerate it, but rejects it, dispels it, gets rid of it, and brings it to an end, that bhikkhu—who in such a manner is ardent and afraid of wrongdoing—is called constantly energetic and resolute.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Whether walking or standing,<br>
Sitting or lying down<br>
Whoever thinks such thoughts<br>
That are evil and worldly—<br>
He is following a wrong path,<br>
Infatuated with delusive things.<br>
Such a bhikkhu cannot reach<br>
Enlightenment which is supreme.</p>
<p>Whether walking or standing,<br>
Sitting or lying down,<br>
Whoever overcomes these thoughts,<br>
Delighting in the quelling of thoughts—<br>
Such a bhikkhu is able to reach<br>
Enlightenment which is supreme.</p>
