<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc518"></a>When a wise person fully understands that old age and death—<br>
To which an ignorant unawakened person is bound—<br>
Are suffering; and they are mindful, practising <i>jhāna</i>:<br>
There is no greater pleasure than this.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc519"></a>When attachment, the carrier of suffering,<br>
And craving, the carrier of the suffering of this mass of proliferation,<br>
Are destroyed; and they are mindful, practising <i>jhāna</i>:<br>
There is no greater pleasure than this.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc520"></a>When the blissful eightfold way,<br>
The supreme path, cleanser of all stains,<br>
Is seen with wisdom; and they are mindful, practising <i>jhāna</i>:<br>
There is no greater pleasure than this.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc521"></a>When one develops that peaceful state,<br>
Sorrowless, stainless, unconditioned,<br>
Cleanser of all stains, and cutter of fetters and bonds:<br>
There is no greater pleasure than this.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc522"></a>When the thunder-cloud rumbles in the sky,<br>
And the rain falls in torrents on the path of birds everywhere,<br>
And a monk has gone to a mountain cave, practising <i>jhāna</i>:<br>
There is no greater pleasure than this.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc523"></a>When sitting on a riverbank covered in flowers,<br>
Garlanded with many-coloured forest plants<br>
One is truly happy, practising <i>jhāna</i>:<br>
There is no greater pleasure than this.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc524"></a>When it is midnight in a lonely forest,<br>
And the sky rains, and the lions roar,<br>
And a monk has gone to a mountain cave, practising <i>jhāna</i>:<br>
There is no greater pleasure than this.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc525"></a>When one’s own thoughts have stopped,<br>
Meditating between two mountains, sheltered inside a cleft,<br>
Without stress or heartlessness, practising <i>jhāna</i>:<br>
There is no greater pleasure than this.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc526"></a>When one is happy, destroyer of stains, heartlessness, and sorrow,<br>
Without obstructions, entanglements, and darts,<br>
And with all defilements annihilated, practising <i>jhāna</i>:<br>
There is no greater pleasure than this.</p>
