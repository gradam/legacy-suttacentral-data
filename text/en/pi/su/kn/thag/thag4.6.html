<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc287"></a>During the spring festival at Gayā,<br>
It was so welcome for me<br>
To see the Buddha,<br>
Teaching the supreme Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc288"></a>He was glorious, the teacher of a community,<br>
Who had realised the highest, a leader,<br>
Conqueror of the world with its gods;<br>
His vision was unequalled.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc289"></a>A great being of power, a great hero,<br>
A great light, without defilements.<br>
With the utter ending of all defilements,<br>
The teacher has no fear from any direction.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc290"></a>For a long time, sadly, I was corrupted,<br>
Fettered by the bond of wrong view.<br>
That Blessed One, Senaka,<br>
Released me from all ties.</p>
