<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc747"></a>For a long time, unfortunately,<br>
Though I ardently contemplated the Dhamma,<br>
I didn’t have peace of mind;<br>
So I asked ascetics and holy men:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc748"></a>“Who has crossed over the world?<br>
Whose attainment culminates in the deathless?<br>
Whose teaching do I accept,<br>
To understand the highest goal?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc749"></a>I was hooked inside,<br>
Like a fish swallowing bait;<br>
Bound like the demon Vepaciti<br>
In Mahinda’s trap.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc750"></a>Dragging it along, I’m not freed<br>
From grief and lamentation.<br>
Who will free me from bonds in the world,<br>
So that I may know awakening?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc751"></a>What ascetic or holy man<br>
Points to the perishable?<br>
Whose teaching do I accept<br>
To wash away old age and death?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc752"></a>Tied up with uncertainty and doubt,<br>
Secured by the power of pride,<br>
Rigid as a mind overcome by anger;<br>
The arrow of covetousness,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc753"></a>Propelled by the bow of craving,<br>
Is stuck in my twice-fifteen ribs—<br>
See how it stands in my breast,<br>
Breaking my strong heart.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc754"></a>Speculative views are not abandoned,<br>
They are sharpened by memories and intentions;<br>
And pierced by this I tremble,<br>
Like a leaf blown by wind.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc755"></a>Arising inside me,<br>
My selfishness is quickly tormented,<br>
Where the body always goes<br>
With its six sense-fields of contact.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc756"></a>I don’t see a healer<br>
Who could pull out my dart of doubt,<br>
Without a lance<br>
Or some other blade.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc757"></a>Without knife or wound,<br>
Who will pull out this dart,<br>
That is stuck inside me,<br>
Without harming any part of my body?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc758"></a>He really would be the Lord of the Dhamma,<br>
The best one to cure the damage of poison;<br>
When I had fallen into deep waters,<br>
He would give me his hand and bring me to the shore.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc759"></a>I’ve plunged into a lake,<br>
And I can’t wash off the mud and dirt,<br>
It’s full of fraud, jealousy, pride,<br>
And dullness and drowsiness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc760"></a>Like a thunder-cloud of restlessness,<br>
Like a rain-cloud of fetters;<br>
Intentions based on lust are winds<br>
That sweep along a person with bad views.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc761"></a>The streams flow everywhere;<br>
A weed springs up and remains;<br>
Who will block the streams?<br>
Who will cut the weed?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc762"></a>“Venerable sir, build a dam<br>
To block the streams;<br>
Don’t let your mind-made streams<br>
Cut you down suddenly like a tree.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc763"></a>That is how the teacher whose weapon is wisdom,<br>
The sage surrounded by the Saṅgha,<br>
Was my shelter when I was full of fear,<br>
Seeking the far shore from the near.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc764"></a>As I was being swept away,<br>
He gave me a strong, simple ladder,<br>
Made of the heartwood of Dhamma,<br>
And he said to me: “Do not fear.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc765"></a>I climbed the tower of the establishment of mindfulness<br>
And looked back down,<br>
At people delighting in identity,<br>
Which in the past I’d obsessed over.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc766"></a>When I saw the path,<br>
As I was embarking on the ship,<br>
Without fixating on the self,<br>
I saw the supreme landing-place.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc767"></a>The dart that arises in oneself,<br>
And that which is caused by attachment to future lives;<br>
He taught the supreme path<br>
For the stopping of these.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc768"></a>For a long time it had lain within me;<br>
For a long time it was fixed in me:<br>
The Buddha cast off the knot,<br>
Curing the poison’s damage.</p>
