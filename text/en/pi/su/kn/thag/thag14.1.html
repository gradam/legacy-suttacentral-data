<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<h1>14.1 Kha­di­ra­vaniya­re­vata</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc645"></a>Since I’ve gone forth<br>
From home life into homelessness,<br>
I’m not aware of any intention<br>
That is ignoble and hateful.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc646"></a>“May these beings be killed! May they be slaughtered!<br>
May they suffer!”—<br>
I’m not aware of having any such intentions<br>
In all this long period of time.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc647"></a>I have been aware of loving-kindness,<br>
Measureless and well-developed,<br>
Gradually built up,<br>
Just as the Buddha taught.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc648"></a>I’m friend and comrade to all,<br>
Compassionate to all beings,<br>
Developing a mind of loving-kindness,<br>
And always delighting in harmlessness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc649"></a>Immovable, unshakable,<br>
I gladden the mind.<br>
I develop the sublime abidings,<br>
Which bad men do not cultivate.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc650"></a>Having entered a meditation state without thought,<br>
A disciple of the Buddha<br>
Is at that moment blessed<br>
With noble silence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc651"></a>Just like a rocky mountain<br>
Is unshakable and firmly grounded;<br>
So when delusion ends,<br>
A monk, like a mountain, doesn’t tremble.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc652"></a>To the blameless man<br>
Who is always seeking purity,<br>
Even a hair-tip of evil<br>
Seems the size of a cloud.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc653"></a>Just like a frontier city,<br>
Is guarded inside and out,<br>
So you should ward yourselves—<br>
Don’t let the moment pass you by.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc654"></a>I don’t long for death;<br>
I don’t long for life;<br>
I await my time,<br>
Like a worker waiting for their wages.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc655"></a>I don’t long for death;<br>
I don’t long for life;<br>
I await my time,<br>
Aware and mindful.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc656"></a>I’ve attended on the teacher<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.<br>
The heavy burden is laid down,<br>
I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn in any state of existence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc657"></a>I’ve attained the goal<br>
For the sake of which I went forth<br>
From home life into homelessness—<br>
The ending of all fetters.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc658"></a>Strive on with heedfulness:<br>
This is my advice.<br>
Come, I’ll realise <i>nibbāna</i>—<br>
I’m liberated in every way.</p>
