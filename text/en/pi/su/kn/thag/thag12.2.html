<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<h1>12.2 Sunīta</h1>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc620"></a>I was born in a low-class family,<br>
Poor, with little to eat.<br>
My job was lowly—<br>
I threw out the old flowers.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc621"></a>Shunned by people,<br>
I was disregarded and treated with contempt.<br>
I humbled my heart,<br>
And paid respects to many people.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc622"></a>Then I saw the Buddha,<br>
Honoured by the Saṅgha of monks,<br>
The great hero,<br>
Entering the capital city of Magadhā.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc623"></a>I dropped my carrying-pole<br>
And approached to pay respects.<br>
Out of compassion for me,<br>
The supreme man stood still.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc624"></a>When I had paid respects at the teacher’s feet,<br>
I stood to one side,<br>
And asked the most excellent of all beings<br>
For the going-forth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc625"></a>Then the teacher, being sympathetic,<br>
And having compassion for the whole world,<br>
Said to me, “Come, monk!”<br>
That was my full ordination.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc626"></a>Staying alone in the wilderness,<br>
Without laziness,<br>
I did what the teacher said,<br>
As the conqueror had advised me.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc627"></a>In the first watch of the night,<br>
I recollected my previous births.<br>
In the middle watch of the night,<br>
I purified the divine eye.<br>
In the last watch of the night,<br>
I tore apart the mass of darkness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc628"></a>At the end of the night,<br>
As the sunrise drew near,<br>
Indra and Brahmā came<br>
And paid homage me with hands in <i>añjalī</i>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc629"></a>“Homage to you, thoroughbred among men!<br>
Homage to you, supreme among men!<br>
Your defilements are ended—<br>
You, sir, are worthy of offerings.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc630"></a>When he saw me honored<br>
By the assembly of gods,<br>
The teacher smiled,<br>
And said the following:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc631"></a>“By austerity and by the holy life,<br>
By restraint and by taming:<br>
By this one is a holy man,<br>
This is the supreme holiness.”</p>
