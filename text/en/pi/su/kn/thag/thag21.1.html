<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<h1>21.1 Vaṅgīsa</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1219"></a>“Now that I’ve gone forth<br>
From the home life into homelessness,<br>
I’m assailed<br>
By the reckless thoughts of the Dark One.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1220"></a>Even if a thousand mighty princes and great archers<br>
Well trained, with strong bows,<br>
Might completely surround me,<br>
I would not flee.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1221"></a>And if women come,<br>
Many more than that,<br>
They won’t scare me:<br>
I stand firm in Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1222"></a>Only once did I personally hear<br>
From the Buddha, Kinsman of the Sun,<br>
About the path leading to <i>nibbāna</i>;<br>
My mind was delighted with that teaching.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1223"></a>Wicked one, if you come near me<br>
As I live like this,<br>
I’ll act in such a way that you, Death,<br>
Will not even see the path I travel.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1224"></a>Entirely abandoning likes and dislikes,<br>
Along with thoughts attached to the household life,<br>
He wouldn’t get entangled in anything,<br>
He is a monk without entanglements.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1225"></a>On this earth and in the sky,<br>
Whatever form you take when entering the world<br>
Wears out, it is all impermanent;<br>
Reflective people live understanding this.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1226"></a>People are bound in their attachments<br>
To what is seen, heard, and thought.<br>
Being imperturbable, expel desire for these things;<br>
For one they call a sage does not cling to these things.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1227"></a>Attached to sixty kinds of wrong views with their modes of thought,<br>
Unenlightened people are fixed in wrong principles;<br>
But that monk wouldn’t go to any sectarian group,<br>
Still less would he take up corrupt ways.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1228"></a>Clever, and for a long time established in <i>samādhi</i>,<br>
Free of deceit, disciplined, without envy,<br>
The sage has realised the state of peace,<br>
Since he has realized <i>nibbāna</i>, he awaits his time.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1229"></a>Abandon conceit, Gotama!<br>
Completely abandon the path to conceit;<br>
Infatuated with the path to conceit,<br>
You’ve had regrets for a long time.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1230"></a>Smeared by smears and slain by conceit,<br>
People fall into hell.<br>
When people slain by conceit are reborn in hell,<br>
They grieve for a long time.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1231"></a>But a monk never grieves<br>
If they practice rightly, a victor of the path.<br>
They have renown and happiness,<br>
And they rightly call him a ‘Seer of Dhamma’.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1232"></a>So don’t be hard-hearted, be energetic,<br>
With hindrances abandoned, purified,<br>
And with conceit abandoned completely,<br>
Be at peace, and use knowledge to make an end.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1233"></a>“I’ve got a burning desire for pleasure;<br>
My mind is on fire!<br>
Please, out of compassion, Gotama,<br>
Tell me how to quench the flames.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1234"></a>“Your mind is on fire<br>
Because of a perversion of perception.<br>
Avoid noticing the attractive aspect of things<br>
That provokes lust.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1235"></a>Meditate on the unattractive,<br>
Unified, in <i>samādhi</i>;<br>
With mindfulness immersed in the body,<br>
Make much of disenchantment.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1236"></a>Meditate on the signless,<br>
Throw out the underlying tendency to conceit,<br>
And when you have a breakthrough in understanding conceit,<br>
You will live at peace.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1237"></a>“Speak only such words<br>
As do not hurt yourself<br>
Nor harm others.<br>
Such speech is truly well spoken.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1238"></a>Speak only pleasing words,<br>
Words received gladly;<br>
Pleasing words are those<br>
That don’t have bad effects on others.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1239"></a>Truth itself is the undying word:<br>
This is an eternal principle.<br>
Realists say that the Dhamma and its meaning<br>
Are grounded in the truth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1240"></a>The reliable words spoken by the Buddha<br>
For realizing <i>nibbāna</i>,<br>
And making an end of suffering:<br>
This really is the best kind of speech.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1241"></a>“His understanding is profound, he is wise,<br>
He is skilled in knowing the path and what is not the path;<br>
Sāriputta, of great understanding,<br>
Teaches Dhamma to the monks.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1242"></a>He teaches in brief,<br>
Or he speaks at length,<br>
His voice, which sounds like a myna bird,<br>
Inspires intuition.</p> 
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1243"></a>While he teaches<br>
The monks hear his sweet voice,<br>
Sounding attractive,<br>
Clear and mellifluous;<br>
They listen joyfully<br>
With hearts uplifted.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1244"></a>“Today, on the fifteenth day <i>uposatha</i>,<br>
500 monks have gathered together to purify their precepts.<br>
Tshese sages without affliction have cut off their fetters and bonds,<br>
They will not be reborn again into any state of existence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1245"></a>Just as a wheel-rolling emperor<br>
Surrounded by ministers<br>
Travels all around this<br>
Land that is circled by sea;</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1246"></a>So disciples with the three knowledges,<br>
Destroyers of death,<br>
Attend upon the winner of the battle,<br>
The unsurpassed caravan leader.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1247"></a>All are sons of the Blessed One—<br>
There is no rubbish here.<br>
I bow to the Kinsman of the Sun,<br>
The destroyer of the dart of craving.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1248"></a>Over a thousand monks<br>
Attend on the Fortunate One<br>
As he teaches the immaculate Dhamma:<br>
<i>Nibbāna</i>, free of fear from any direction.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1249"></a>They hear the stainless Dhamma<br>
Taught by the Buddha.<br>
The Buddha is so brilliant,<br>
Revered by the monastic Saṅgha.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1250"></a>Blessed One, you are called ‘elephant’,<br>
Supreme among all sages.<br>
You are like a great cloud<br>
That rains on your disciples.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1251"></a>Setting out from his daytime dwelling<br>
Wanting to see the teacher;<br>
Great hero, your disciple,<br>
Vaṅgisa bows at your feet.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1252"></a>“Overcoming Māra’s devious path,<br>
I wander with hard-heartedness dissolved.<br>
See him, the liberator from bonds,<br>
Unattached, teaching the Dhamma by analysing each section.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1253"></a>He has explained in many ways<br>
The path to cross the flood.<br>
Since the deathless has been explained,<br>
The seers of Dhamma stand unshakable.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1254"></a>Like a piercing light,<br>
He’s seen the transcendence of all states of rebirth;<br>
Knowing it and witnessing it,<br>
He taught it first to the group of five.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1255"></a>When Dhamma is well taught like this,<br>
How could those that understand Dhamma be heedless?<br>
Therefore you should train in the teaching of the Blessed One,<br>
Heedful, and always reverent.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1256"></a>“The senior monk who was awakened after the Buddha<br>
Koṇḍañña is keenly energetic,<br>
And regularly gains the meditative states<br>
Of happiness and seclusion.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1257"></a>Whatever can be realised<br>
By a disciple following the teacher,<br>
He has attained it all,<br>
Diligent in training himself.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1258"></a>With great power and the three knowledges,<br>
Skilled in reading the minds of others,<br>
Koṇḍañña, the heir to the Buddha,<br>
Bows at the teacher’s feet.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1259"></a>“As the sage, who has gone beyond suffering,<br>
Sits on the mountainside,<br>
He is attended by disciples with the three knowledges,<br>
Destroyers of death.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1260"></a>Moggallāna, of great psychic power,<br>
Searches with his mind,<br>
Looking into their minds<br>
For one liberated without attachments.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1261"></a>So they attend upon Gotama,<br>
The sage gone beyond suffering,<br>
Who is endowed with all attributes,<br>
And with a multitude of qualities.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1262"></a>“Just as, when the clouds have vanished,<br>
The moon shines in the sky, stainless as the sun,<br>
So Aṅgīrasa, great sage,<br>
Your renown outshines the entire world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1263"></a>“We used to wander, drunk on poetry,<br>
From village to village, from town to town;<br>
Then we saw the Buddha,<br>
Who has gone beyond all Dhammas.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1264"></a>He, the sage gone beyond suffering,<br>
Taught me the Dhamma;<br>
When we heard the Dhamma, we became confident—<br>
Faith arose in us.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1265"></a>Hearing him speak of<br>
The aggregates, the sense-bases,<br>
And the elements, I understood.<br>
I went forth into homelessness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1266"></a>Truly, Tathāgatas arise<br>
For the benefit of the many<br>
Men and women<br>
Who follow their teachings.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1267"></a>Truly, it is for their benefit<br>
That the sage indeed realised awakening;<br>
The monks and nuns, who see<br>
The natural principles of the Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1268"></a>The seer, the Buddha,<br>
The Kinsman of the Sun,<br>
Has well taught the four noble truths<br>
Out of compassion for living beings.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1269"></a>Suffering, the origin of suffering,<br>
The transcending of suffering ,<br>
And the noble eight-fold path<br>
That leads to the stilling of suffering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1270"></a>As these things were spoken,<br>
So I have seen them.<br>
I’ve realized my own true goal,<br>
The Buddha’s instruction is completed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1271"></a>It was so welcome for me,<br>
As I was in the presence of the Buddha.<br>
Of things which are shared,<br>
I encountered the best.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1272"></a>I’ve realised the perfection of direct knowledge;<br>
I have supernormal hearing;<br>
I have the three knowledges and psychic powers,<br>
I’m skilled at reading the minds of others.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1273"></a>“I ask the teacher unrivalled in understanding,<br>
Who has cut off all doubts in this very life—<br>
Has a monk died at Aggāḷava, who was<br>
Well-known, famous, and attained to <i>nibbāna</i>?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1274"></a>Nigrodhakappa was his name;<br>
It was given to that brahman by you, Blessed One.<br>
Yearning for freedom, energetic, firmly seeing the Dhamma,<br>
He wandered in your honor.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1275"></a>O Sakyan, who sees all around,<br>
All of us wish to know about that disciple.<br>
Our ears are eager to hear,<br>
For you’re truly the most excellent teacher.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1276"></a>Cut off our doubt, declare this to us;<br>
Your understanding is vast, tell us of his <i>nibbāna</i>!<br>
You see all around, so speak among us,<br>
Like the thousand-eyed Sakka in the assembly of the gods!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1277"></a>Whatever ties there are, or paths to delusion,<br>
Or things that are on the side of unknowing,<br>
Or that are bases of doubt:<br>
When it comes to the Tathāgata there are none;<br>
Among people, his eye is the best.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1278"></a>For if no man were ever to disperse defilements,<br>
Like the wind dispersing a mass of clouds,<br>
Darkness would cover the whole world,<br>
And even a lamp would not shine.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1279"></a>The wise are makers of light;<br>
My hero, that is what I think of you.<br>
We’ve come to you for your insight and knowledge:<br>
Here in this assembly, declare to us about Kappāyana.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1280"></a>Swiftly send forth your sweet voice,<br>
Like a goose stretching its neck, gently honking,<br>
The sound is smooth, with a lovely tone:<br>
Alert, we are all listening to you.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1281"></a>You have entirely abandoned birth and death;<br>
Restrained and pure, speak the Dhamma!<br>
Unenlightened people can’t fulfil all their wishes,<br>
But Tathāgatas can achieve what they intend.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1282"></a>Your answer is definitive, and we will accept it,<br>
For you have perfect understanding.<br>
We raise our hands in <i>añjalī</i> one last time,<br>
Your understanding is unrivalled,<br>
So do not knowingly confuse us.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1283"></a>Knowing the noble Dhamma from top to bottom,<br>
Your energy is unrivalled, so do not knowingly confuse us.<br>
Like a man in the baking summer sun would long for water,<br>
I long for the rain of your voice to fall on my ears.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1284"></a>Surely Kappāyana<br>
Did not live the spiritual life in vain?<br>
Did he realise <i>nibbāna</i>,<br>
Or did he still have a remnant of defilement?<br>
Let us hear what kind of liberation he had!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1285"></a>“He cut off craving for conception and corporeality in this very life,<br>
The river of darkness that had long lain within him.<br>
He has entirely crossed over birth and death.”<br>
So declared the Blessed One, the leader of the five.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1286"></a>“Now that I have heard your words,<br>
Best of sages, I am confident.<br>
My question, it seems, was not in vain,<br>
The brahman did not deceive me.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1287"></a>As he spoke, so he acted;<br>
He was a disciple of the Buddha.<br>
He cut the net of death the illusionist,<br>
So extended and strong.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1288"></a>Blessed One, Kappāyana saw<br>
The starting point of grasping.<br>
He has gone beyond the realm of death,<br>
So very hard to cross.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1289"></a>God of gods, best of men, I bow to you;<br>
And to your son,<br>
Who follows your example, a great hero<br>
An elephant, true son of an elephant.”</p>
