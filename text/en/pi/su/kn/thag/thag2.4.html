<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc127"></a>My hut on the bank of the Ganges<br>
Is made from three palm leaves.<br>
My alms-bowl is a funeral pot,<br>
My robe is castoff rags.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc128"></a>In my first two rainy seasons<br>
I spoke only one word.<br>
In my third rainy season,<br>
The mass of darkness was torn apart.</p>
