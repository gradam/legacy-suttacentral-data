<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc393"></a>I, Kulla, went to a charnel ground<br>
And saw a woman left there,<br>
Discarded in a cemetery,<br>
Full of worms that devoured her.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc394"></a>See this body, Kulla—<br>
Diseased, filthy, rotten,<br>
Oozing and trickling,<br>
A fools’ delight.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc395"></a>Taking Dhamma as a mirror<br>
For realizing knowledge and vision,<br>
I reviewed this body,<br>
Vacant, inside and out.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc396"></a>As this is, so is that;<br>
As that is, so is this.<br>
As below, so above;<br>
As above, so below.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc397"></a>As by day, so by night;<br>
As by night, so by day.<br>
As before, so after;<br>
As after, so before.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc398"></a>Not even music played by a five-piece band,<br>
Can give such pleasure<br>
As there is for one with unified mind,<br>
Discerning the Dhamma rightly.</p>
