<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc557"></a>My progress was slow,<br>
I was despised in the past;<br>
My brother turned me away,<br>
Saying, “Go home now”.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc558"></a>Turned away at the gate<br>
Of the Saṅgha’s monastery,<br>
I stood there sadly,<br>
Longing for the teaching.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc559"></a>Then Blessed One came<br>
And touched my head.<br>
Taking me by the arm,<br>
He brought me into the Saṅgha’s monastery.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc560"></a>The teacher, out of compassion,<br>
Gave me a foot-wiping cloth, saying:<br>
“Focus your awareness <br>
Exclusively on this clean cloth.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc561"></a>After I had listened to his words,<br>
I dwelt delighting in his teaching,<br>
Practising <i>samādhi</i><br>
For the attainment of the highest goal.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc562"></a>I know my past life;<br>
My divine eye is clarified;<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc563"></a>I, Panthaka, created a thousand<br>
Images of myself,<br>
And sat in the delightful mango grove<br>
Until the time for the meal offering was announced.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc564"></a>Then the teacher sent to me<br>
A messenger to announce the time.<br>
When the time was announced,<br>
I flew to him through the air.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc565"></a>I paid homage to the teacher’s feet,<br>
And sat to one side.<br>
When he knew I was seated,<br>
The teacher received the offering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc566"></a>Recipient of gifts from the whole world,<br>
Receiver of sacrifices,<br>
Field of merit for humanity,<br>
He received the offering.</p>
