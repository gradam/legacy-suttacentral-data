<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc340"></a>It was truly for my benefit<br>
That the Buddha went to the river Nerañjara;<br>
When I heard his teaching,<br>
I rejected wrong view.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc341"></a>Previously, I performed the higher and lower sacrifices;<br>
I worshipped the sacred flame,<br>
Thinking, “This is purity.”<br>
I was a blind, unenlightened person.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc342"></a>Caught in the thicket of wrong view,<br>
Deluded by misapprehension;<br>
Thinking impurity was purity,<br>
I was blind and ignorant.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc343"></a>I’ve abandoned wrong view,<br>
Rebirth into any state of existence is torn apart,<br>
I worship what is truly worthy of offerings:<br>
I bow to the Tathāgata.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc344"></a>I’ve abandoned all delusion <br>
Rebirth into any state of existence is torn apart,<br>
Transmigration through births is finished,<br>
Now there is no more rebirth into any state of existence.</p>
