<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc537"></a>If no-one else is found<br>
In front or behind,<br>
It’s extremely pleasant,<br>
Dwelling alone in a forest grove.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc538"></a>Come now, I’ll go alone<br>
To the wilderness praised by the Buddha.<br>
It’s pleasant for a monk<br>
Dwelling alone and resolute.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc539"></a>Alone and self-disciplined,<br>
I’ll quickly enter the delightful forest,<br>
Which gives joy to meditators,<br>
And is frequented by rutting elephants.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc540"></a>In Sītavana, so full of flowers,<br>
In a cool mountain cave,<br>
I’ll bathe my limbs<br>
And walk meditation alone.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc541"></a>When will I dwell alone,<br>
Without a companion,<br>
In the great wood, so delightful,<br>
My task complete, free of defilements?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc542"></a>This is what I want to do:<br>
May my wish succeed!<br>
I’ll make it happen myself:<br>
No-one can do someone else’s duty.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc543"></a>Fastening my armour,<br>
I’ll enter the forest.<br>
I won’t leave here<br>
Until I have attained the end of defilements.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc544"></a>As the cool breeze blows<br>
With fragrant scent,<br>
I’ll split ignorance apart,<br>
Sitting on the mountain-peak.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc545"></a>In a forest grove covered with blossoms,<br>
In a cave so very cool,<br>
I take pleasure in Giribbaja,<br>
Happy with the happiness of freedom.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc546"></a>My intentions are fulfilled<br>
Like the moon on the fifteenth day.<br>
With the utter ending of all defilements,<br>
Now there is no more rebirth into any state of existence.</p>
