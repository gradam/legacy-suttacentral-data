<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc303"></a>“Dhamma really protects you if you practice Dhamma;<br>
Dhamma well-practiced brings happiness.<br>
If you practice Dhamma, this is the benefit—<br>
You won’t go to a bad destination.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc304"></a>Dhamma and what is not Dhamma<br>
Don’t both lead to the same results.<br>
What is not Dhamma leads to hell,<br>
While Dhamma takes you to a good destination.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc305"></a>So you should be enthusiastic to perform acts of Dhamma,<br>
Rejoicing in the Fortunate One, the poised.<br>
Disciples of the best of Fortunate Ones are firm in Dhamma;<br>
Those wise ones are led on, going to the very best of refuges.”</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc306"></a>“The boil has been burst from its root,<br>
The net of craving is undone.<br>
He has ended transmigration, he has nothing,<br>
Just like the full moon in a clear night sky.”</p>
