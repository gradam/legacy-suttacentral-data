<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc429"></a>I had just gone forth,<br>
I was seven years old,<br>
When I overcome the dragon king, so mighty,<br>
With my psychic powers.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc430"></a>And I brought water for my mentor<br>
From the great lake Anotatta.<br>
When he saw me,<br>
My teacher said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc431"></a>“Sāriputta, see this<br>
Young boy coming,<br>
Carrying a water pot,<br>
Serene inside himself.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc432"></a>His conduct inspires confidence,<br>
He is of lovely deportment:<br>
He is Anuruddha’s novice,<br>
Excelling in psychic powers.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc433"></a>Made a thoroughbred by a thoroughbred,<br>
Made good by the good,<br>
Educated and trained by Anuruddha,<br>
Who has completed his work.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc434"></a>Having attained the highest peace<br>
And witnessed the unshakable,<br>
That novice Sumana<br>
Wants no-one to know about him.”</p>
