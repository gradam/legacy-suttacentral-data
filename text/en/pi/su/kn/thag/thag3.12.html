<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc252"></a>Sadly, I was intelligent and peaceful,<br>
But only enough to critically analyse the meaning.<br>
The five kinds of sensual pleasure in  the world,<br>
So delusory, were my downfall.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc253"></a>Entering into Māra’s domain,<br>
I was struck by a powerful dart;<br>
But I was able to free myself<br>
From the trap laid by the king of death.<br>

</p><p><a class="sc" id="sc254"></a>All sensual pleasures have been abandoned,<br>
Rebirth in all states of existence is torn apart,<br>
Transmigration through births is finished,<br>
Now there is no more rebirth into any state of existence.</p>
