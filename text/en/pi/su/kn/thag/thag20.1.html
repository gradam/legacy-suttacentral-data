<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

Woven together with flesh and tendons—<br>
Damn this stinking body!<br>
Which cherishes other bodies.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1155"></a>You sack of dung wrapped in skin!<br>
You demon with horns on your chest!<br>
Your body has nine streams,<br>
Which are flowing all the time.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1156"></a>With its nine streams,<br>
Your body stinks, full of dung.<br>
A monk seeking purity would avoid it altogether,<br>
Like excrement.</p>

Like I do,<br>
They’d keep far away,<br>
Like a cesspit in the rainy-season.”</p>

As you say, ascetic!<br>
But some sink here<br>
Like an old bull in mud.”</p>

Of making the sky yellow,<br>
Or any other colour,<br>
Would only be causing trouble for themselves.</p>

Serene inwardly.<br>
Evil-minded one, don’t attack me<br>
Like a moth to a bonfire.”</p>

With its gems and earrings;<br>
It is bones wrapped with skin,<br>
Made pretty by its clothes.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1163"></a>Rouged feet<br>
And powdered face<br>
Is enough to delude a fool,<br>
But not a seeker of the far shore.</p>

And eyeliner applied,<br>
Is enough to delude a fool,<br>

The disgusting body all adorned<br>
 Is enough to delude a fool,<br>

But the deer didn’t get caught in the snare;<br>
Having eaten the bait we go,<br>
Leaving the deer-trapper to lament.</p>

They arise, then they cease—<br>
