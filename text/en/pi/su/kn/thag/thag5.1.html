<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc315"></a>I, a monk, went to a charnel ground<br>
And saw a woman left there,<br>
Discarded in a cemetery,<br>
Full of worms that devoured her.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc316"></a>Some men were disgusted,<br>
Seeing her dead and rotten;<br>
But sexual desire arose in me,<br>
I was as if blind to her oozing body.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc317"></a>Quicker than the boiling of rice<br>
I left that place,<br>
Mindful and aware,<br>
I sat down to one side.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc318"></a>Then the realization<br>
Came upon me—<br>
The danger became clear,<br>
And I was firmly repulsed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc319"></a>Then my mind was liberated—<br>
See the excellence of the Dhamma!<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>
