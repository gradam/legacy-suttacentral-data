<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc567"></a>Filled with different kinds of dirt,<br>
A great producer of dung,<br>
Like a stagnant cesspool,<br>
A great boil, a great wound,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc568"></a>Full of pus and blood,<br>
Sunk in a toilet-pit,<br>
Trickling with fluids<br>
This putrid body always oozes.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc569"></a>Bound by sixty tendons,<br>
Coated with a fleshy coating,<br>
Clothed in a jacket of skin,<br>
This putrid body is worthless.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc570"></a>Held together by a skeleton of bones,<br>
And bound by sinews;<br>
It assumes postures<br>
Due to a complex of many things.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc571"></a>We set out in the certainty of death,<br>
In the presence of the king of death;<br>
And having discarded the body right here,<br>
A person goes where he likes.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc572"></a>Enveloped by ignorance,<br>
Tied by the four ties,<br>
This body is sinking in the flood,<br>
Caught in the net of underlying tendencies.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc573"></a>Yoked with the five hindrances,<br>
Afflicted by thought,<br>
Accompanied by the root of craving,<br>
Hidden by delusion.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc574"></a>So the body goes on,<br>
Propelled by the mechanism of deeds.<br>
But existence ends in perishing;<br>
Separated, the body perishes.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc575"></a>Those blind, unawakened people<br>
Who think of this body as theirs,<br>
Swell the horrors of the charnel-ground,<br>
And take up rebirth again in some state of existence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc576"></a>Those who avoid this body,<br>
Like a snake smeared with dung,<br>
They expel the root of rebirth,<br>
And realise <i>nibbāna</i>, without defilements.</p>
