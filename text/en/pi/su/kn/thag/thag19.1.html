<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<h1>19.1. Tāḷapuṭa</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1095"></a>Oh, when will I stay in a mountain cave,<br>
Alone, with no companion,<br>
Discerning all states of existence as impermanent?<br>
This hope of mine, when will it be?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1096"></a>Oh, when will I stay happily in the forest,<br>
A sage wearing a torn robe, dressed in ochre,<br>
Unselfish, without desire,<br>
With greed, hatred, and delusion destroyed?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1097"></a>Oh, when will I stay alone in the wood,<br>
Fearless, discerning this body as impermanent,<br>
A nest of death and disease,<br>
Oppressed by death and old age;<br>
When will it be?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1098"></a>Oh, when will I live, having grasped the sharp sword of wisdom<br>
And cut the creeper of craving that tangles around everything,<br>
The mother of fear, the bringer of suffering,<br>
When will it be?<br>

</p><p><a class="sc" id="sc1099"></a>Oh, when will I, seated on the lion’s throne,<br>
Swiftly grasp the sword of the sages,<br>
Forged by wisdom, of fiery might,<br>
And swiftly break Māra and his army? When will it be?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1100"></a>Oh, when will I be seen striving in the assemblies<br>
By those who are virtuous, poised, respecting the Dhamma,<br>
Seeing things as they are, with faculties subdued?<br>
When will it be?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1101"></a>Oh, when will I focus on my own goal on Giribbaja mountain,<br>
Free of oppression by laziness, hunger, thirst,<br>
Wind, heat, insects, and reptiles?<br>
When will it be?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1102"></a>Oh, when will I have <i>samādhi</i> and mindfulness,<br>
And with understanding attain the four truths,<br>
That were realized by the great sage,<br>
And are so very hard to see? When will it be?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1103"></a>Oh, when will I, devoted to tranquillity,<br>
See with understanding the infinite sights,<br>
Sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and mental phenomena<br>
As burning? When will it be?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1104"></a>Oh, when will I not be downcast<br>
Because of criticism,<br>
Nor elated because of praise?<br>
When will it be?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1105"></a>Oh when will I discern the aggregates<br>
And the infinite varieties of phenomena,<br>
Both internal and external, as no more than<br>
Wood, grass, and creepers? When will it be?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1106"></a>Oh, when will the winter clouds rain freshly<br>
As I wear my robe in the forest,<br>
Walking the path trodden by the sages?<br>
When will it be?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1107"></a>Oh, when will I rise up, intent on attaining the deathless,<br>
Hearing in the mountain cave<br>
The cry of the crested peacock in the forest?<br>
When will it be?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1108"></a>Oh, when will I cross the Ganges, Yamunā,<br>
And Sarasvatī rivers, the Pātāla country,<br>
And the dangerous Baḷavāmukha sea,<br>
By psychic power, without hindrance? When will it be?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1109"></a>Oh, when will I be devoted to <i>jhāna</i>,<br>
Rejecting entirely the signs of beauty,<br>
Splitting apart desire for sensual pleasures,<br>
Like an elephant that wanders without ties;<br>
When will it be?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1110"></a>Oh, when will I realise the teaching of the great sage<br>
And be content, like a poor person in debt,<br>
Harassed by creditors, who finds a hidden treasure?<br>
When will it be?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1111"></a>For many years you begged me,<br>
“Enough of living in a house for you!”<br>
Why do you not urge me on, mind,<br>
Now I’ve gone forth as an ascetic?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1112"></a>Didn’t you beg me, mind,<br>
“On Giribbaja, the birds with colourful wings,<br>
Greeting the thunder, Mahinda’s voice,<br>
Will delight you as you practice <i>jhāna</i> in the forest”?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1113"></a>In my family circle, friends, loved ones, and relatives;<br>
And in the world, sports and play, and sensual pleasures;<br>
All these I have abandoned for the sake of this:<br>
And even then you’re not content with me, mind!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1114"></a>This is mine alone, it doesn’t belong to others;<br>
When it is time to don your armour, why lament?<br>
Reflecting that all this is unstable,<br>
I went forth, longing for the deathless state.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1115"></a>The methodical teacher, supreme among people,<br>
Great physician, charioteer of tractable people, said,<br>
“The mind sways like a monkey,<br>
So it’s very hard to control if you are not free of lust.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1116"></a>Sensual pleasures are diverse, sweet, delightful;<br>
Ignorant unenlightened people are attached to them.<br>
Seeking to be reborn in another state of existence, they wish for suffering;<br>
Led on by their mind, they’re relegated to hell.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1117"></a>“Staying in the grove resounding with cries<br>
Of peacocks and herons, and liked by leopards and tigers,<br>
Abandon concern for the body, without fail!”<br>
So you used to urge me, mind.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1118"></a>“Develop the <i>jhāna</i>s and spiritual faculties,<br>
The powers, factors of awakening, and <i>samādhi</i> meditation;<br>
Realise the three knowledges in the teaching of the Buddha!”<br>
So you used to urge me, mind.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1119"></a>“Develop the eight-fold path for realizing the deathless,<br>
Emancipating, plunging into the end of  all suffering,<br>
And cleansing all defilements!”<br>
So you used to urge me, mind.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1120"></a>“Properly reflect on the aggregates as suffering,<br>
And abandon that from which suffering arises;<br>
Make an end of suffering in this very life!”<br>
So you used to urge me, mind.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1121"></a>“Properly discern that impermanence is suffering,<br>
That emptiness is non-self, and that misery is death.<br>
Uproot the wandering mind!”<br>
So you used to urge me, mind.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1122"></a>“Bald, unsightly, accursed,<br>
Seek alms amongst families, bowl in hand.<br>
Devote yourself to the word of the teacher, the great sage!”<br>
So you used to urge me, mind.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1123"></a>“Wander the streets well-restrained,<br>
With your mind unattached to families and sensual pleasures,<br>
Like the full moon when the night is clear!”<br>
So you used to urge me, mind.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1124"></a>“Be a wilderness-dweller and an alms-eater,<br>
One who lives in charnel grounds, a rag-robe wearer,<br>
One who never lies down, always delighting in ascetic practices.”<br>
So you used to urge me, mind.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1125"></a>Mind, when you urge me towards the impermanent and unstable,<br>
You are acting just like a person who plants trees,<br>
Then, when they are about to fruit,<br>
Wishes to cut down the very same trees.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1126"></a>You, incorporeal mind, far-traveller, lone-wanderer:<br>
I won’t do your bidding any more.<br>
Sensual pleasures are suffering, painful, and very dangerous;<br>
I’ll wander with my mind focussed only on <i>nibbāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1127"></a>I didn’t renounce due to bad luck or shamelessness,<br>
Nor because of a whim, nor banishment,<br>
Nor for the sake of a livelihood;<br>
It was because I agreed to the promise you made, mind.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1128"></a>“Having few wishes, abandoning disparagement,<br>
Stilling suffering: these are praised by good people.”<br>
So you used to urge me, mind,<br>
But now you continue with your old habits!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1129"></a>Craving, ignorance, the loved and unloved,<br>
Pretty sights, pleasant feelings,<br>
And the delightful kinds of sensual pleasure: I’ve vomited them all;<br>
And I can’t swallow back what I’ve vomited up.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1130"></a>I’ve done your bidding everywhere, mind!<br>
For many births, I haven’t done anything to upset you,<br>
Yet you show your gratitude by producing craving inside yourself!<br>
For a long time I’ve transmigrated in the suffering you’ve created.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1131"></a>Only you, mind, make us holy men;<br>
You make us lords or royal sages;<br>
Sometimes we become traders or workers;<br>
Life as a god is also on account of you.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1132"></a>You alone make us titans;<br>
Because of you we are born in hell;<br>
Then sometimes we become animals,<br>
Life as an ghost is also on account of you.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1133"></a>Come what may, you won’t betray me again,<br>
Dazzling me with your ever-changing display;<br>
You play with me like I’m mad—<br>
But how have I ever failed you, mind?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1134"></a>In the past my mind wandered<br>
How it wished, where it liked, as it pleased.<br>
Now I’ll carefully guide it,<br>
As a rutting elephant is guided by a trainer with a hook.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1135"></a>The teacher willed that this world appear to me<br>
As impermanent, unstable, insubstantial.<br>
Mind, let me leap into the conqueror’s teaching,<br>
Carry me over the great flood, so very hard to cross.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1136"></a>Things have changed, mind!<br>
Nothing could make me return to your control!<br>
I’ve gone forth in the teaching of the great sage,<br>
Those like me don’t come to ruin.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1137"></a>Mountains, oceans, rivers, the earth;<br>
The four directions, the intermediate directions, below and in the sky;<br>
The three states of existence are all impermanent and troubled—<br>
Where can you go to find happiness, mind?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1138"></a>Mind, what will you do to someone<br>
Who has made the ultimate commitment?<br>
Nothing could make me a follower<br>
Under your control, mind;<br>
There’s no way you’d touch a bellows<br>
With a mouth open at each end;<br>
Let alone the body flowing with its nine streams!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1139"></a>You’ve ascended the mountain peak, full of nature’s beauty,<br>
Frequented by boars and antelopes,<br>
A grove sprinkled with fresh water in the rainy-season;<br>
And there you’ll be happy in your cave-home.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1140"></a>Peacocks with beautiful necks and crests,<br>
Colourful tail-feathers and wings,<br>
Crying out at the sweet-sounding thunder:<br>
They’ll delight you as you practice <i>jhāna</i> in the forest.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1141"></a>When the sky has rained down,<br>
And the grass is four inches high,<br>
And the grove is full of flowers, like a cloud,<br>
In the mountain cleft, like the fork of a tree, I’ll lie;<br>
It will be as soft as cotton-buds.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1142"></a>I’ll act as a master does:<br>
Let whatever I get be enough for me.<br>
I’ll make you as supple,<br>
As a good worker makes a cat-skin bag.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1143"></a>I’ll act as a master does:<br>
Let whatever I get be enough for me.<br>
I’ll control you with my energy,<br>
As the trainer controls a rutting elephant with a hook.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1144"></a>Now that you’re well-tamed and reliable,<br>
I can use you, like a trainer uses a straight-running horse,<br>
To practice the safe path,<br>
Cultivated by those who take care of their minds.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1145"></a>I shall strongly fasten you to a meditation subject,<br>
As an elephant is tied to a post with firm rope.<br>
You’ll be well-guarded by me, well-developed by mindfulness,<br>
And unattached to rebirth in all states of existence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1146"></a>You’ll use understanding to cut the follower of the wrong path,<br>
Restrain them by practice, and settle them on the right path;<br>
And when you have seen the cause of suffering arise and pass away,<br>
You’ll be an heir to the greatest teacher.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1147"></a>Under the sway of the four distortions, mind,<br>
You led me as if all around the world;<br>
And now you won’t associate with the great sage of compassion,<br>
The cutter of fetters and bonds?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1148"></a>Like a deer roaming free in the colourful forest,<br>
I’ll ascend the lovely mountain wreathed in cloud,<br>
And rejoice to be on that hill, free of folk—<br>
There is no doubt you’ll perish, mind.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1149"></a>The men and women who live under your will and command,<br>
Whatever pleasure they experience,<br>
They are ignorant and fall under Māra’s control;<br>
Loving life, they’re your disciples, mind.</p>
