<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<p>Chapter of the Thirteens</p>
<h1>13.1 Soṇa­koḷi­visa</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc632"></a>He who was special in the kingdom,<br>
The attendant to the king of Aṅga,<br>
Today is special in the Dhamma—<br>
Soṇa has gone beyond suffering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc633"></a>Five should be cut off, five should be abandoned,<br>
Five should be developed further.<br>
A monk who has gone beyond five attachments is called<br>
“One who has crossed the flood.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc634"></a>If a monk is insolent and negligent,<br>
Concerned only with externals,<br>
Their virtue, <i>samādhi</i>, and understanding<br>
Do not become fulfilled.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc635"></a>They disregard what should be done,<br>
And do what shouldn’t be done.<br>
For the insolent and the negligent,<br>
Their defilements only grow.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc636"></a>Those that have properly undertaken<br>
Constant mindfulness of the body,<br>
Don’t practise what shouldn’t be done,<br>
But consistently do what should be done.<br>
Mindful and clearly aware,<br>
Their defilements come to an end.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc637"></a>Go on the straight path that has been taught—<br>
Don’t turn back.<br>
Urge yourself on,<br>
And realise <i>nibbāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc638"></a>When my energy was over-exerted,<br>
The unsurpassed teacher in the world,<br>
Made the simile of the lute for me;<br>
The Seer taught the Dhamma,
</p><p><a class="sc" id="sc639"></a>And when I heard what he said,<br>
I stayed joyfully in his teaching.<br>
Practising serenity of mind,<br>
I attained the supreme goal.<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc640"></a>Committed to renunciation,<br>
And seclusion of the heart,<br>
Committed to non-harming,<br>
And the end of grasping;
</p><p><a class="sc" id="sc641"></a>Committed to the end of craving,<br>
And an unconfused heart;<br>
When seeing the senses arise,<br>
The mind is perfectly liberated.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc642"></a>For the monk who is perfectly liberated,<br>
His mind at peace,<br>
There’s nothing to add to what has been done;<br>
And nothing further to be done.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc643"></a>Just as a solid rock<br>
Is not moved by the wind,<br>
So sights, tastes, sounds<br>
Smells, touches, all of these,
</p><p><a class="sc" id="sc644"></a>As well as pleasant and unpleasant phenomena,<br>
Don’t shake one who is poised,<br>
Whose mind is firm and unfettered,<br>
Contemplating vanishing.</p>
