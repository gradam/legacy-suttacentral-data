<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc258"></a>Transmigrating, I went to hell;<br>
Again and again, I went to the ghost realm;<br>
Many times I dwelt long<br>
In the suffering of the animal realm.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc259"></a>I was also reborn as a human;<br>
From time to time I went to heaven;<br>
I’ve stayed in the corporeal realms and the incorporeal,<br>
Among the percipient-nor-non-percipient, and the non-percipient.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc260"></a>I understood these states of existence to be worthless:<br>
Conditioned, unstable, always in motion.<br>
When I understood the origin of rebirth within myself,<br>
Mindful, I found peace.</p>
