<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc350"></a>“Struck by a wind ailment,<br>
While staying in a forest grove;<br>
You’ve gone into a tough place for gathering alms:<br>
How will you get by, monk?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc351"></a>“Pervading my body<br>
With lots of rapture and happiness,<br>
Putting up with what’s tough,<br>
I’ll dwell in the forest.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc352"></a>Developing the establishments of mindfulness,<br>
The faculties and the powers,<br>
Developing the factors of awakening,<br>
I’ll dwell in the forest.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc353"></a>Having seen those who are energetic, resolute,<br>
Always of strong effort,<br>
Harmonious and serene,<br>
I’ll dwell in the forest.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc354"></a>Recollecting the Buddha<br>
The highest, the tamed, who has <i>samādhi</i><br>
Not lazy by day or by night<br>
I’ll dwell in the forest.”</p>
