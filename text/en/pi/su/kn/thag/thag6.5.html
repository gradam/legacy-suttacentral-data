<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc399"></a>For a person who lives heedlessly,<br>
Craving grows like a parasitic creeper.<br>
They jump from here to there, like a monkey<br>
That wants fruit in a forest grove.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc400"></a>Whoever is overcome by this wretched craving,<br>
This attachment to the world,<br>
Their sorrow grows,<br>
Like grass in the rain.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc401"></a>But whoever overcomes this wretched craving,<br>
This attachment to the world,<br>
Their sorrows fall from them,<br>
Like a water-drop from a lotus.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc402"></a>I say this to you, venerables,<br>
All those who have gathered here:<br>
Dig up the root of craving,<br>
Like someone who is looking for roots will dig up the grass.<br>
Don’t let Māra break you again and again,<br>
Like a stream breaking a reed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc403"></a>Act on the Buddha’s words,<br>
Don’t let the moment pass you by.<br>
Those who pass up the moment<br>
Grieve when they end up in hell.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc404"></a>Heedlessness is always an impurity,<br>
Impurity comes from heedlessness.<br>
With heedfulness and knowledge,<br>
Pluck out your own dart.</p>
