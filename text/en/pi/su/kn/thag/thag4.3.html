<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc275"></a>Others don’t understand<br>
That here we come to our end.<br>
Those that do understand this<br>
Settle their quarrels because of that.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc276"></a>And when those who don’t understand<br>
Behave as though they were immortal;<br>
Those who understand the Dhamma<br>
Are like the healthy among the sick.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc277"></a>Any lax act,<br>
Or corrupt religious observance,<br>
Or a spiritual life arousing suspicion,<br>
Does not yield great fruit.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc278"></a>Whoever has no respect<br>
For their companions in the spiritual life<br>
Is as far from true Dhamma<br>
As the sky is from the earth.</p>
