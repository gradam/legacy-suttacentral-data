<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<h1>16.2 Pārā­pariya</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc726"></a>While he was sitting alone<br>
In seclusion, practicing <i>jhāna</i>,<br>
An ascetic, the monk Pārāpariya<br>
Had this thought:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc727"></a>“Following what system<br>
What vow, what conduct,<br>
May I do what I need to do for myself,<br>
Without harming anyone else?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc728"></a>The faculties of human beings<br>
Can lead to both welfare and harm.<br>
Unguarded they lead to harm;<br>
Guarded they lead to welfare.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc729"></a>By protecting the faculties,<br>
Taking care of the faculties,<br>
I can do what I need to do for myself<br>
Without harming anyone else.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc730"></a>If your eye wanders<br>
Among sights without check,<br>
Not seeing the danger,<br>
You’re not freed from suffering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc731"></a>If your ear wanders<br>
Among sounds without check,<br>
Not seeing the danger,<br>
You’re not freed from suffering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc732"></a>If, not seeing the escape,<br>
You indulge in smell,<br>
You’re not freed from suffering,<br>
Being infatuated by smells.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc733"></a>Recollecting the sour,<br>
And the sweet and the bitter,<br>
Captivated by craving for taste,<br>
You don’t understand the heart.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc734"></a>Recollecting lovely<br>
And pleasurable touches,<br>
Full of desire, you experience<br>
Many kinds of suffering because of lust.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc735"></a>Unable to protect<br>
The mind from such mental phenomena,<br>
Suffering follows them,<br>
Because of all five.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc736"></a>This body is full of pus and blood,<br>
As well as many carcasses;<br>
But cunning people decorate it<br>
Like a lovely painted casket.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc737"></a>You don’t understand that<br>
The gratification of sweetness turns out bitter,<br>
And attachments to those we love are suffering,<br>
Like a razor smeared all over with honey.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc738"></a>Full of lust for the sight of a woman,<br>
For the voice and the smells of a woman,<br>
For a woman’s touch,<br>
You experience many kinds of suffering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc739"></a>All of a woman’s streams<br>
Flow from five to five.<br>
Whoever, being energetic,<br>
Is able to curb these,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc740"></a>Purposeful and firm in Dhamma,<br>
Would be clever and discerning;<br>
Even while enjoying himself,<br>
What he does is connected with Dhamma and its purpose.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc741"></a>You should avoid a meaningless task<br>
That is leading to decline.<br>
Thinking, “This is not to be done”,<br>
Is being diligent and discerning.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc742"></a>Whatever is meaningful,<br>
A principled happiness,<br>
Let one undertake and practice that:<br>
This is the best happiness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc743"></a>Coveting the possessions of others<br>
By whatever means, whether high or low,<br>
One kills, injures, and torments,<br>
Violently plundering the possessions of others.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc744"></a>Just as a strong person when building<br>
Knocks out a peg with a peg,<br>
So the skilful person<br>
Knocks out the faculties with the faculties.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc745"></a>Developing faith, energy, <i>samādhi</i><br>
Mindfulness, and wisdom;<br>
Destroying the five with the five,<br>
The perfected one lives without worry.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc746"></a>Purposeful and firm in Dhamma,<br>
Having fulfilled in every respect<br>
The instructions spoken by the Buddha,<br>
That person prospers in happiness.</p>
