<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc169"></a>The barber approached<br>
To shave my head.<br>
I picked up a mirror<br>
And looked at my body.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc170"></a>My body looked vacant;<br>
I was blind, but the darkness left me.<br>
My fancy hairdo has been cut off:<br>
Now there is no more rebirth into any state of existence.</p>
