<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc370"></a>Whatever wise person, understanding their teacher’s words,<br>
Stays with them, their affection growing;<br>
That wise person is indeed devoted—<br>
Knowing about Dhammas, they’re distinguished.</p>

Whoever does not tremble, but reflects instead,<br>
That wise person is indeed strong—<br>
Knowing about Dhammas, they’re distinguished.</p>

Their wisdom is deep, and they see the subtle goal;<br>
That wise person is indeed immovable—<br>
Knowing about Dhammas, they’re distinguished.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc373"></a>They’re very learned, and have memorized the Dhamma,<br>
practising Dhamma in accordance with Dhamma;<br>
That wise person is indeed such—<br>
Knowing about Dhammas, they’re distinguished.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc374"></a>They know the meaning of what is said,<br>
And having known, they act appropriately;<br>
That wise person is indeed one who has mastered the meaning—<br>
Knowing about Dhammas, they’re distinguished.</p>
