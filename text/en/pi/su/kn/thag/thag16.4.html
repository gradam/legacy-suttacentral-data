<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc769"></a>See this fancy puppet,<br>
A heap of sores, a composite body,<br>
Diseased, obsessed over,<br>
Having no lasting stability.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc770"></a>See this fancy shape,<br>
With its gems and earrings;<br>
It is bones wrapped with skin,<br>
Made pretty by its clothes.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc771"></a>Rouged feet<br>
And powdered face<br>
Is enough to delude a fool,<br>
But not a seeker of the far shore.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc772"></a>Hair in eight braids<br>
And eyeliner,<br>
Is enough to delude a fool,<br>
But not a seeker of the far shore.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc773"></a>Like a newly decorated makeup box,<br>
The disgusting body all adorned<br>
 Is enough to delude a fool,<br>
But not a seeker of the far shore.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc774"></a>The hunter laid his trap,<br>
But the deer didn’t get caught in the snare;<br>
Having eaten the bait we go,<br>
Leaving the deer-trapper to lament.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc775"></a>The hunter’s trap is broken,<br>
And the deer didn’t get caught in the snare;<br>
Having eaten the bait we go,<br>
Leaving the deer-trapper to lament.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc776"></a>I see rich people in the world,<br>
Who, because of delusion, don’t give away the wealth they have gained.<br>
Greedily, they hoard their riches,<br>
Yearning for ever more sensual pleasures.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc777"></a>A king who conquered the earth by force,<br>
Ruling the land from sea to sea,<br>
Unsatisfied with the near shore of the ocean,<br>
Would still yearn for the further shore.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc778"></a>The king and most other people<br>
Reach death while not free from craving.<br>
As if lacking, they abandon the body;<br>
For sensual pleasures offer no satisfaction in this world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc779"></a>Relatives lament, their hair let loose,<br>
Saying “Ah! Alas! They’re not immortal!”<br>
They take out the body wrapped in a shroud,<br>
Heap up a pyre, and burn it.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc780"></a>It is poked with stakes while being burnt,<br>
Wearing a single cloth, all wealth abandoned.<br>
Neither kinsman nor friends nor companions<br>
Can help you when you are dying.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc781"></a>Heirs take the riches,<br>
But beings fare on in accord with their deeds.<br>
Riches don’t follow you when you die;<br>
Nor do children, wife, wealth, nor kingdom.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc782"></a>Longevity isn’t gained by riches,<br>
Nor does wealth banish old age;<br>
For the wise have said that this life is short,<br>
It is not eternal, its nature is decay.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc783"></a>The rich and the poor feel its touch;<br>
The fool and the wise feel it too;<br>
But the fool lies as if struck down by their own folly,<br>
While the wise don’t tremble at the touch.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc784"></a>Therefore wisdom is definitely better than wealth,<br>
Since by wisdom you can attain perfection in this life;<br>
But if you stay unperfected, then because of delusion,<br>
You’ll do evil deeds in life after life.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc785"></a>One person enters a womb and the world beyond,<br>
Transmigrating from one life to the next;<br>
While someone of little wisdom, placing faith in them,<br>
Also enters a womb and the world beyond.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc786"></a>Just as a bandit caught at the entrance to a house<br>
Is punished due to their own bad deeds;<br>
So after passing away, in the world beyond<br>
People are punished due to their own bad deeds.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc787"></a>Sensual pleasures are diverse, sweet, delightful,<br>
But their variety of forms stress the mind;<br>
Seeing danger in the kinds of sensual pleasure,<br>
I went forth, O King.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc788"></a>As fruit falls from a tree, so people fall,<br>
Young and old, when the body breaks up.<br>
Seeing this, too, I went forth, O King;<br>
Without doubt, the ascetic life is better.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc789"></a>Endowed with faith, I went forth,<br>
Entering the conqueror’s teaching.<br>
My going forth wasn’t wasted;<br>
I eat food free of debt.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc790"></a>I saw sensual pleasures as burning,<br>
Gold as a cutting blade,<br>
Conception in a womb as suffering,<br>
And the hells as very fearful.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc791"></a>Knowing this danger,<br>
I was struck with awe.<br>
I was stabbed, and then I became peaceful;<br>
I’ve attained the end of defilements.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc792"></a>I’ve attended on the teacher<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.<br>
The heavy burden is laid down,<br>
I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn in any state of existence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc793"></a>I’ve attained the goal<br>
For the sake of which I went forth<br>
From home life into homelessness—<br>
The ending of all fetters.</p>
