<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc279"></a>Damn these stinking bodies!<br>
They’re on Māra’s side, they ooze;<br>
And bodies have nine streams<br>
That are always flowing.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc280"></a>Don’t think much of bodies;<br>
Don’t disparage the Tathāgathas.<br>
They’re not even aroused by heaven,<br>
Let alone by humans.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc281"></a>But those dumb fools,<br>
With bad advisors, shrouded in delusion,<br>
That kind of person is aroused by bodies,<br>
When Māra has thrown the snare.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc282"></a>Those who have discarded<br>
Lust, hatred, and ignorance:<br>
They’ve cut the strings, they’re no longer bound—<br>
Such people are not aroused by bodies.</p>
