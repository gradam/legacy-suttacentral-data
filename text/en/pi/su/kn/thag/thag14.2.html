<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc659"></a>Just as a fine thoroughbred,<br>
Yoked to a carriage, endures the load,<br>
Oppressed by the heavy burden,<br>
And yet doesn’t try to escape the yoke;</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc660"></a>So too, those who are as filled with understanding<br>
As the ocean is with water,<br>
Don’t look down on others;<br>
This is the noble Dhamma regarding living beings.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc661"></a>People who fall under the dominion of time,<br>
Under the dominion of being reborn in one state of existence after another,<br>
Undergo suffering,<br>
And those young men grieve in this life.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc662"></a>Elated by anything happy,<br>
Downcast by anything suffering:<br>
These both destroy the fool,<br>
Who doesn’t see in accordance with reality.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc663"></a>But those who in suffering and in happiness,<br>
And in the middle have overcome the weaver;<br>
They stand like a royal pillar,<br>
Neither elated nor downcast.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc664"></a>Not to gain or loss,<br>
Not to fame or reputation,<br>
Not to criticism or praise,<br>
Not to suffering or happiness—</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc665"></a>The wise cling to nothing,<br>
Like a droplet on a lotus-leaf.<br>
They are happy everywhere,<br>
And unconquered everywhere.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc666"></a>There’s principled loss,<br>
And there’s unprincipled gain.<br>
Principled loss is better<br>
Than unprincipled gain.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc667"></a>There’s the fame of the unintelligent,<br>
And there’s the disrepute of the discerning.<br>
Disrepute of the discerning is better<br>
Than the fame of the unintelligent.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc668"></a>There’s praise by fools,<br>
And there’s criticism by the discerning.<br>
Criticism by the discerning is better<br>
Than praise by fools.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc669"></a>There’s the happiness of sensual pleasures,<br>
And there’s the suffering of seclusion.<br>
The suffering of seclusion is better<br>
Than the happiness of sensual pleasures.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc670"></a>There’s life without principles,<br>
And there’s death with principles.<br>
Death with principles is better<br>
Than life without principles.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc671"></a>Those who have abandoned sensual pleasures and anger,<br>
Their minds at peace regarding being reborn in one state of existence or another,<br>
They wander in the world unattached,<br>
For them nothing is beloved or unloved.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc672"></a>Having developed the factors of awakening,<br>
The spiritual faculties, and the powers,<br>
I’ve attained ultimate peace:<br>
<i>Nibbāna</i> without defilements.</p>
