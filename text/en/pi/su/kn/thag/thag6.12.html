<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc441"></a>For one without anger, tamed, living calmly,<br>
Liberated by right knowledge,<br>
At peace, poised:<br>
Where would anger come from?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc442"></a>One who gets angry at an angry person<br>
Just makes things worse.<br>
One who doesn’t get angry at an angry person<br>
Wins a battle hard to win.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc443"></a>When you know that the other is angry,<br>
You act for the good of both<br>
Yourself and the other,<br>
If you are mindful, and stay calm.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc444"></a>Those who are unskilled in Dhamma<br>
Consider one who heals both<br>
Oneself and the other<br>
To be a fool.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc445"></a>If anger arises in you,<br>
Reflect on the simile of the saw;<br>
If craving for flavours arises in you,<br>
Remember the simile of the son’s flesh.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc446"></a>If your mind runs<br>
Among sensual pleasures and rebirth in various states of existence,<br>
Quickly curb it with mindfulness,<br>
As one would curb a greedy cow eating corn.</p>
