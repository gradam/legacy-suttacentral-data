<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc417"></a>It was well-taught by the one who sees,<br>
The Buddha, Kinsman of the Sun,<br>
Who has gone beyond all fetters,<br>
And destroyed all rolling-on.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc418"></a>Leading to liberation, crossing over,<br>
Drying up the root of craving,<br>
Cutting off the root of poison, the slaughter-house,<br>
And leading to <i>nibbāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc419"></a>By breaking the root of unknowing,<br>
It smashes the mechanism of deeds,<br>
And looses the thunderbolt of knowledge<br>
On the taking up of consciousnesses.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc420"></a>Informing us about our feelings,<br>
Freeing us from grasping,<br>
Wisely contemplating all states of existence<br>
As a pit of burning coals.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc421"></a>Very sweet, very deep,<br>
Preventing birth and death,<br>
Leading to the stilling of suffering, bliss—<br>
It is the noble eightfold path.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc422"></a>Knowing deed as deed,<br>
And result as result;<br>
Seeing dependently originated phenomena<br>
As if they were in a clear light;<br>
Leading to great security, peace,<br>
It’s excellent at the end.</p>
