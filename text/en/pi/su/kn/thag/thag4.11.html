<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc307"></a>When the crane with its beautiful white wings,<br>
Startled by fear of the dark thundercloud,<br>
Flees, seeking shelter—<br>
Then the River Ajakaraṇī delights me.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc308"></a>When the crane, so pure and white,<br>
Startled by fear of the dark thundercloud,<br>
Seeks for a cave to shelter in, but can’t see one—<br>
Then the River Ajakaraṇī delights me.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc309"></a>Who wouldn’t be delighted<br>
By the rose-apple trees<br>
That adorn both banks of the river there,<br>
Behind my cave?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc310"></a>Rid of snakes, that death-mad swarm,<br>
 The lazy frogs croak:<br>
“Today isn’t the time to stray from mountain streams;<br>
Ajakaraṇī is safe, pleasant, and delightful.”</p>
