<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc480"></a>I saw the most excellent person,<br>
Walking meditation in the shade of the terrace,<br>
So I approached,<br>
And bowed to the most excellent man.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc481"></a>Arranging my robe over one shoulder,<br>
And clasping my hands together,<br>
I walked meditation alongside that stainless one,<br>
Most excellent of all beings.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc482"></a>The wise one, skilled in questions,<br>
Questioned me.<br>
Brave and fearless,<br>
I answered the teacher.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc483"></a>When all his questions were answered,<br>
The Tathāgata congratulated me.<br>
Looking around the monastic Saṅgha,<br>
He said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc484"></a>“It is a blessing for the people of Aṅga and Magadha<br>
That this person enjoys their<br>
Robe and almsfood,<br>
Requisites and lodgings,<br>
Their respect and service—<br>
It’s a blessing for them,” he declared.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc485"></a>“Sopāka, from this day on<br>
You are invited to come and see me.<br>
And Sopāka, let this<br>
Be your full ordination.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc486"></a>At seven years old<br>
I received full ordination.<br>
I bear my final body—<br>
Oh, the excellence of the Dhamma!</p>
