<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1055"></a>You shouldn’t live for the adulation of a following;<br>
It turns your mind, and makes <i>samādhi</i> hard to find.<br>
Seeing that popularity is suffering,<br>
You shouldn’t accept a following.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1056"></a>A sage should not visit respectable families<br>
It turns your mind, and makes <i>samādhi</i> hard to find.<br>
One who’s eager and greedy for flavours,<br>
Misses the goal that brings such happiness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1057"></a>They know that this really is a bog,<br>
This homage and veneration among respectable families.<br>
Honor is a subtle dart, hard to extract,<br>
And hard for a bad man to give up.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1058"></a>I came down from my lodging<br>
And entered the city for alms.<br>
I courteously stood by<br>
While a leper ate.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1059"></a>With his putrid hand<br>
He offered me a morsel.<br>
Putting the morsel in my bowl,<br>
His finger broke off right there.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1060"></a>Leaning against the foot of a wall,<br>
I ate that morsel.<br>
While eating, and afterwards,<br>
I did not feel any disgust.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1061"></a>Anyone who makes use of<br>
Leftovers for food,<br>
Putrid urine as medicine,<br>
The root of a tree as lodging,<br>
And rags from the rubbish-heap as robes,<br>
Is at home in any direction.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1062"></a>Where some have perished<br>
While climbing the mountain,<br>
There Kassapa ascends;<br>
An heir of the Buddha,<br>
Aware and mindful,<br>
Relying on his psychic powers.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1063"></a>Returning from alms-round,<br>
Kassapa ascends the mountain,<br>
And practices <i>jhāna</i> without grasping,<br>
With fear and dread abandoned.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1064"></a>Returning from alms-round,<br>
Kassapa ascends the mountain,<br>
And practices <i>jhāna</i> without grasping,<br>
Quenched amongst those who burn.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1065"></a>Returning from alms-round,<br>
Kassapa ascends the mountain,<br>
And practices <i>jhāna</i> without grasping,<br>
His duty done, without defilements.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1066"></a>Strewn with garlands of the musk-rose tree,<br>
These regions are delightful.<br>
Lovely, resounding with the trumpeting of elephants:<br>
These rocky crags delight me!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1067"></a>They look like blue-black storm clouds, glistening, <br>
Cooled with the waters of clear-flowing streams,<br>
And covered with ladybird beetles:<br>
These rocky crags delight me!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1068"></a>Like the peak of a blue-black storm cloud,<br>
Or like a fine peaked house,<br>
Lovely, resounding with the trumpeting of elephants:<br>
These rocky crags delight me!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1069"></a>The rain comes down on the lovely flats,<br>
In the mountains frequented by sages.<br>
Echoing with the cries of peacocks,<br>
These rocky crags delight me!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1070"></a>It’s enough for me,<br>
Desiring to practice <i>jhāna</i>, resolute and mindful.<br>
It’s enough for me,<br>
A resolute monk, desiring the goal.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1071"></a>It’s enough for me,<br>
A resolute monk, desiring ease,<br>
It’s enough for me,<br>
Desiring to practice, resolute and poised.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1072"></a>Covered with flowers of flax,<br>
Like the sky covered with clouds,<br>
Full of flocks of many different birds,<br>
These rocky crags delight me!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1073"></a>Empty of householders,<br>
Frequented by herds of deer,<br>
Full of flocks of many different birds,<br>
These rocky crags delight me!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1074"></a>The water is clear and the gorges are wide,<br>
Monkeys and deer are all around;<br>
Festooned with dewy moss,<br>
These rocky crags delight me!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1075"></a>Music played by a five-piece band<br>
Can never make you as happy,<br>
As when, with unified mind,<br>
You rightly discern the Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1076"></a>Don’t get involved in lots of work,<br>
Avoid people, and don’t try to get more requisites.<br>
If you’re eager and greedy for flavours,<br>
You’ll miss the goal that brings such happiness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1077"></a>Don’t get involved in lots of work,<br>
Avoid what doesn’t lead to the goal.<br>
The body gets worn out and fatigued,<br>
And when you suffer, you won’t find tranquillity.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1078"></a>You won’t see yourself<br>
By merely reciting words,<br>
Wandering stiff-necked<br>
And thinking, “I’m better.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1079"></a>The fool is no better,<br>
But they think they are.<br>
The wise don’t praise<br>
Stiff-minded people.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1080"></a>Whoever is not affected<br>
By the modes of conceit—<br>
“I am better”, “I am not better”,<br>
“I am worse”, or “I am the same”—</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1081"></a>Poised, with such understanding,<br>
Endowed with virtues,<br>
And devoted to tranquillity of mind:<br>
That is who the wise praise.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1082"></a>Whoever has no respect<br>
For their companions in spiritual life<br>
Is as far from true Dhamma<br>
As the sky is from the earth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1083"></a>Those whose conscience and shame<br>
Are always rightly established,<br>
Thrive in the spiritual life,<br>
For them, there is no rebirth in any state of existence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1084"></a>If a monk who is haughty and fickle,<br>
Wears rags from the rubbish-heap,<br>
Like a monkey in a lion skin,<br>
That doesn’t make him impressive.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1085"></a>But if they are humble and stable,<br>
Controlled, with faculties restrained,<br>
Then wearing rags from the rubbish-heap is impressive,<br>
Like a lion in a mountain cave.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1086"></a>These famous gods<br>
Endowed with psychic powers,<br>
All 10,000 of them,<br>
Belong to the retinue of Brahmā.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1087"></a>They stand with hands in <i>añjalī</i>,<br>
Honouring Sāriputta,<br>
The general of the Dhamma, the hero,<br>
The great meditator who is endowed with <i>samādhi</i>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1088"></a>“Homage to you, thoroughbred among men!<br>
Homage to you, best among men!<br>
We do not even understand<br>
The basis of your <i>jhāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1089"></a>The profound domain of the Buddhas<br>
Is truly amazing.<br>
We do not understand them,<br>
Though we’ve gathered here to split hairs.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1090"></a>When he saw the company of gods<br>
Paying homage to Sāriputta—<br>
Who is truly worthy of homage—<br>
Kappina smiled.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1091"></a>As far as this Buddha-field extends<br>
I am outstanding in ascetic practices.<br>
I have no equal,<br>
Apart from the great sage himself.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1092"></a>I’ve attended on the teacher<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.<br>
The heavy burden is laid down,<br>
I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn in any state of existence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1093"></a>Like a lotus flower unstained by water,<br>
Gotama the immeasurable is unstained<br>
By robes, lodgings, or food.<br>
He inclines to renunciation,<br>
And has escaped being reborn in the three states of existence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1094"></a>The great sage’s neck is the establishment of mindfulness;<br>
Faith is his hands, and wisdom his head.<br>
Having great knowledge,<br>
He always wanders, quenched.</p>
