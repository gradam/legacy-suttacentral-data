<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc447"></a>The rain saturates things that are covered up;<br>
It doesn’t saturate things that are open.<br>
Therefore you should open up a covered thing,<br>
So the rain will not saturate it.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc448"></a>The world is crushed by death,<br>
Surrounded by old age,<br>
Struck by the dart of craving,<br>
And ever obscured by desire.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc449"></a>The world is crushed by death,<br>
Caged by old age,<br>
Beaten constantly, without respite,<br>
Like a thief being flogged.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc450"></a>Three things are coming, like a wall of flame:<br>
Death, disease, and old age.<br>
No power can stand before them,<br>
And there is no speed to flee.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc451"></a>Don’t waste your day,<br>
A little or a lot.<br>
Every night that passes<br>
Shortens your life by that much.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc452"></a>Walking or standing,<br>
Sitting or lying down:<br>
Your final night draws near.<br>
You have no time to be heedless.</p>
