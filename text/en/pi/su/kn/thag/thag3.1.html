<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc219"></a>Seeking purity the wrong way,<br>
I worshipped the sacred fire in a grove.<br>
Not knowing the path to purity,<br>
I mortified my flesh in search of immortality.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc220"></a>I’ve gained <em>this</em> happiness by means of happiness:<br>
See the excellence of the Dhamma!<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc221"></a>In the past I was related to Brahmā,<br>
But now I’m really a brahmin:<br>
I have the three knowledges, I’m cleansed,<br>
I’m an initiate, and I’m accomplished in sacred knowledge.</p>
