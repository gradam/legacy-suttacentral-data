<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<h1>7.1 Sun­dara­samud­da</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc459"></a>She was adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,<br>
With a garland of flowers and perfume of sandalwood,<br>
Her feet brightly rouged:<br>
A courtesan wearing slippers.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc460"></a>She took off her slippers in front of me,<br>
Her hands in <i>añjalī</i>,<br>
And softly and sweetly<br>
She spoke to me, smiling:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc461"></a>“You’re too young to have gone forth;<br>
Come, stay in my teaching!<br>
Enjoy human sensual pleasures,<br>
I’ll give you riches.<br>
I promise this is the truth—<br>
I’ll swear by the Sacred Flame.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc462"></a>And when we’ve grown old together,<br>
Leaning on sticks,<br>
We’ll both go forth,<br>
So we’ll win both ways.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc463"></a>When I saw the courtesan seducing me,<br>
Her hands in añjalī,<br>
Adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,<br>
Like a snare of death laid down.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc464"></a>Then the realization<br>
Came upon me—<br>
The danger became clear,<br>
And I was firmly repulsed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc465"></a>Then my mind was liberated—<br>
See the excellence of the Dhamma!<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>
