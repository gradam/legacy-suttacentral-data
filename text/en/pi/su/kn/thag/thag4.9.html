<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc299"></a>Covered with gold,<br>
Surrounded by all her maids,<br>
With my son upon her hip,<br>
My wife came up to me.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc300"></a>I saw her coming,<br>
The mother of my son,<br>
Adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,<br>
Like a snare of death laid down.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc301"></a>Then the realization<br>
Came upon me—<br>
The danger became clear,<br>
And I was firmly repulsed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc302"></a>Then my mind was liberated—<br>
See the excellence of the Dhamma!<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>
