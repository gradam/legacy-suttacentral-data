<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc211"></a>The peacocks cry out<br>
With their fair crests and tails,<br>
Their lovely blue necks and fair faces,<br>
Their beautiful song and their call.<br>
This broad earth is lush with grass and dew,<br>
And the sky’s full of beautiful clouds.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc212"></a>A person who is practising <i>jhāna</i> is happy in mind,
<br>
And their appearance is uplifting;<br>
Going forth in the teaching of the Buddha 
<br>
Is easy for a good person.<br>
You should realise that supreme, unchanging state,<br>
So very pure, subtle, and hard to see.</p>
