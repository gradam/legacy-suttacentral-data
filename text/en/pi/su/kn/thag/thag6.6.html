<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc405"></a>In the twenty-five years<br>
Since I went forth,<br>
I have not found peace of mind,<br>
Even for as long as a finger-snap.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc406"></a>Since I couldn’t get my mind unified,<br>
I was tormented by sexual desire.<br>
Wailing, with outstretched arms,<br>
I burst out of my dwelling.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc407"></a>Should I … or should I take the knife?<br>
What’s the point of living?<br>
Rejecting the training,<br>
How should one like me come to an end?<br>

</p><p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc408"></a>Then I picked up a razor;<br>
And sat on a bench;<br>
The razor was ready—<br>
To cut my vein.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc409"></a>Then the realization<br>
Came upon me—<br>
The danger became clear,<br>
And I was firmly repulsed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc410"></a>Then my mind was liberated—<br>
See the excellence of the Dhamma!<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>
