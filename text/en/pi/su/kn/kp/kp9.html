<h1>The Discourse on Friendliness Meditation</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>What should be done by one skilful in good, who has comprehended the state of peace:<br>
he ought to be able, straight, and upright, easy to speak to, meek, without conceit,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>satisfied <span class="supplied">with little</span>, easy to support, free from duties, and light in living,<br>
with faculties at peace, prudent, not forward, and greedless among the families,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>he should not do the slightest thing whereby others who are wise might find fault <span class="supplied">with him</span>.<br>
“<span class="supplied">May all beings</span> be happy and secure, may all beings in their hearts be happy!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Whatsoever breathing beings there are—trembling, firm, or any other <span class="supplied">beings</span>,<br>
whether they be long or great, of middle size, short, tiny, or of compact <span class="supplied">body</span>,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>those who are seen, and those who are unseen, those who live far away, those who are near,<br>
those who are born, and those who still seek birth—may all beings in their hearts be happy!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>No one should cheat another, nor should he despise anyone wherever they be,<br>
he should not long for suffering for another because of anger or resentment.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>In the same way as a mother would protect her son, her only son, with her life,<br>
so toward all beings he should develop the measureless thought <span class="supplied">of friendliness</span>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>Towards the whole wide world he should develop the measureless thought of friendliness,<br>
above, below, and across <span class="supplied">the middle</span>, without barriers, hate, or enemy.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>Standing, walking, sitting, lying, for as long as he is without torpor,<br>
he should be resolved on this mindfulness, for this, they say here, is the <span class="supplied">true</span> spiritual life.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>Without going back to <span class="supplied">wrong</span> views, virtuous, and endowed with <span class="supplied">true</span> insight,<br>
having removed <span class="supplied">all</span> greed for sense pleasures, he will never come to lie in a womb again.</p>
