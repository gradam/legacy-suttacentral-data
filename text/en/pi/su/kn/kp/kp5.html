<h1>The Discourse on the Blessings</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">This is what I heard</span>: At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthi, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s grounds in Jeta’s Wood. Then a certain god, at the end of the night, having lit up the whole of Jeta’s Wood with his surpassing beauty, approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he stood on one side. While standing on one side that god recited this verse to the Gracious One:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Many are the gods and the men<br>
who have thought about the blessings<br>
hoping for safety:<br>
now please say what is a supreme blessing.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Not associating with fools,<br>
with the wise associating,<br>
honouring those worthy of honour:<br>
this is a supreme blessing.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Living in a suitable place,<br>
formerly having done good deeds,<br>
having the right aspiration for oneself:<br>
this is a supreme blessing.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Having great learning and craft,<br>
being disciplined and well trained,<br>
and whatever words are well spoken:<br>
this is a supreme blessing.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Attending on one’s mother and father,<br>
looking after one’s wife and sons,<br>
having work that is not confusing:<br>
this is a supreme blessing.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“Giving, and living by the Dhamma,<br>
and looking after one’s relatives, <br><span class="add">performing</span> actions that are blameless:<br>
this is a supreme blessing.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“Abstaining, refraining from bad deeds,<br>
restraint from intoxicating drink,<br>
being heedful regarding <span class="add">all</span> things:<br>
this is a supreme blessing.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“Having respect and being humble,<br>
being satisfied and grateful,<br>
listening to the Dhamma at the right time:<br>
this is a supreme blessing.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>“Being patient and easily spoken to,<br>
having sight of ascetics,<br>
discussing the Dhamma at the right time:<br>
this is a supreme blessing.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>“Austerity, living spiritually,<br>
insight into the noble truths,<br>
and experiencing Emancipation:<br>
this is a supreme blessing.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>“He whose mind does not waver,<br>
when it is touched by things of this world,<br>
being griefless, dustless, and secure:<br>
this is a supreme blessing.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>“Having done as here directed,<br>
being undefeated everywhere,<br>
they go everywhere in safety:<br>
for them this is a supreme blessing.”</p>
