<h1>3.12. Observation of Dualities</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī at the eastern Monastery, the mansion of Migāra’s Mother. Now at that time the Buddha was seating in the open, surrounded by the the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. It was the <i>uposatha</i> day, the night of the fifteenth day full moon. Then the Buddha, having surveyed the Saṅgha of monks sitting silently, addressed the bhikkhus:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Bhikkhus, if they ask you, ‘What is the purpose of learning those skilful principles that are noble, emancipating, leading to full enlightenment?’ You should say to them, ‘Only for the sake of knowing in accordance with reality the duality of principles.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“What duality should you speak of?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“‘This is suffering, this is the origin of suffering’, this is one observation. ‘This is the end of suffering, this is the practice leading to the end of suffering’, this is a second observation. Rightly observing this duality, a monk who meditates diligent, ardent, and resolute may expect one of two results: final knowledge in this very life, or is there is anything left over, non-return.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>This is what the Buddha said. Having said this, the Teacher, the Sublime One, said further:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc730"></a>Those who do not understand suffering,<br>
Or suffering’s origination;<br>
Or where all suffering<br>
Ceases without remainder;<br>
They do not know the path<br>
Leading to the stilling of suffering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc731"></a>They lack the release of the heart,<br>
And the release by understanding;<br>
They are incapable of making an end,<br>
They go again to birth and old age.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc732"></a>Those who do understand suffering,<br>
And suffering’s origination;<br>
And where all suffering<br>
Ceases without remainder;<br>
They know the path<br>
Leading to the stilling of suffering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc733"></a>They possess the release of the heart,<br>
And the release by understanding;<br>
They are capable of making an end,<br>
They do not go again to birth and old age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>“If, bhikkhus, they ask you, ‘Might there be another way of rightly observing duality?’ you should say, ‘There is’. And how is there?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>“‘Whatever suffering arises, all is caused by attachments’, this is one observation. ‘With the complete ending of all attachments there is no arising of suffering’, this is a second observation. Rightly observing this duality, a monk who meditates diligent, ardent, and resolute may expect one of two results: final knowledge in this very life, or is there is anything left over, non-return.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>This is what the Buddha said. Having said this, the Teacher, the Sublime One, said further:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc734"></a>Sufferings come to be because of attachments<br>
Of many kinds in this world.<br>
Whoever, unknowing, makes attachments,<br>
That dull person goes to suffering again and again.<br>
Therefore, understanding,<br>
One should not make attachments,<br>
Observing how suffering comes to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a>“If, bhikkhus, they ask you, ‘Might there be another way of rightly observing duality?’ you should say, ‘There is’. And how is there?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a>“‘Whatever suffering arises, all is caused by ignorance’, this is one observation. ‘With the complete ending of all ignorance there is no arising of suffering’, this is a second observation. Rightly observing this duality, a monk who meditates diligent, ardent, and resolute may expect one of two results: final knowledge in this very life, or is there is anything left over, non-return.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a>This is what the Buddha said. Having said this, the Teacher, the Sublime One, said further:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc735"></a>Those who transmigrate<br>
Through birth and death, again and again;<br>
In this form of existence or some other,<br>
They go under the sway of ignorance alone.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc736"></a>This ignorance really is the great deluder,<br>
Because of which we have transmigrated for a long time,<br>
Those beings who have arrived at understanding,<br>
Do not go to future lives.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a>“‘Whatever suffering arises, all is caused by kammic choices’, this is one observation. ‘With the complete ending of all kammic choices there is no arising of suffering’, this is a second observation. Rightly observing this duality, a monk who meditates diligent, ardent, and resolute may expect one of two results: final knowledge in this very life, or is there is anything left over, non-return.”</p>

All is caused by kammic choices.<br>
With the cessation of such choices,<br>
There is no arising of suffering.</p>

That suffering is caused by kammic choices,<br>
With the settling of all choices,<br>
There is the stopping of perceptions;<br>
Thus suffering comes to an end,<br>
Knowing this as it is.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="25"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc739"></a>Rightly seeing, the ones who know,<br>
Rightly understanding, the clever ones,<br>
Overcoming the fetters of Māra,<br>
Do not go to future lives.</p>

Practising the bad path,<br>
They are far from the ending of fetters.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="35"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc743"></a>But those who fully understand contact,<br>
And with final knowledge have stilled desire,<br>
By comprehending contact,<br>
They are wishless, quenched.</p>

Fully understanding that state,<br>
One is quenched, without corruptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="94"></a>This is what the Buddha said. Pleased, the bhikkhus rejoiced in the Buddha’s words. And while this explanation was being spoken the minds of sixty bhikkhus were freed from the corruptions without grasping.</p>
