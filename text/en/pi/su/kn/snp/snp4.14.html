<p><a class="sc" id="sc922"></a><span class="speaker">Question</span><br>
I ask the Kinsman of the Sun, the great seeker,<br>
About seclusion and the state of peace.<br>
Seeing what is a bhikkhu quenched,<br>
Not grasping at anything in the world?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc923"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
One should completely extract<br>
The root of proliferation and reckoning—<br>
The notion, “I am the thinker”.<br>
One should train to dispel whatever craving<br>
There is inside, ever mindful.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc924"></a>Whatever principle they have known for themselves,<br>
Whether internally or externally,<br>
They would not be stubborn about that,<br>
For good people say that this is not quenching.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc925"></a>You shouldn’t, on that account, think you are better,<br>
Or worse, or even the same;<br>
Though affected by many different things,<br>
You should not keep thinking of yourself.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc926"></a>Totally calm within himself,<br>
A bhikkhu would not seek peace from another;<br>
For one who is at peace with themselves,<br>
There is nothing to hold on to, still less to put down.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc927"></a>As in the middle of the ocean,<br>
There are no waves, but all is still,<br>
So they would be still, unmoving;<br>
A bhikkhu is not haughty at all.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc928"></a><span class="speaker">Question</span><br>
You have taught me, with your eyes open,<br>
Seeing principles for yourself, dispelling dangers;<br>
Venerable sir, tell me the practice,<br>
The rules of conduct and also meditation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc929"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
Not letting their eyes wander,<br>
Turning their ear from crass conversations,<br>
Not greedy for flavors,<br>
And not thinking of anything in the world as “mine”.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc930"></a>When things afflict him,<br>
A bhikkhu would not whinge at all;<br>
He would neither long for rebirth,<br>
Nor tremble at dangers.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc931"></a>He would not store up goods that he gets,<br>
Whether food and drink,<br>
Other edibles or cloth,<br>
And he would not be afraid of not getting anything.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc932"></a>Practising <i>jhāna</i>, not footloose,<br>
Not remorseful, nor negligent;<br>
That bhikkhu would stay in quiet<br>
Places for meditation and sleep.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc933"></a>They would not sleep much,<br>
But be ardent, developing wakefulness;<br>
They would abandon laziness, deceit, jokes, games,<br>
And sex, together with other frivolities.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc934"></a>One of my followers would not cast spells,<br>
Or interpret dreams,<br>
Nor would they practice astrology,<br>
Prognosticate animal sounds,<br>
Practice fertility magic,<br>
Or [earn money] as a healer.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc935"></a>A bhikkhu would not be anxious when criticized,<br>
Nor puffed up when praised;<br>
But would get rid of greed together with<br>
Stinginess, anger, and slander.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc936"></a>They would not continue at a trade,<br>
A bhikkhu would not incur blame at all;<br>
They would not linger in a village,<br>
Nor cajole people hoping to get stuff.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc937"></a>A bhikkhu would not be boastful,<br>
Nor speak with an ulterior motive;<br>
He would not practice impudence,<br>
Nor say things that were argumentative.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc938"></a>He would not be carried away by lies,<br>
Nor deliberately betray anyone;<br>
Nor would he look down on anyone for their<br>
Way of life, intelligence, virtue, or vows.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc939"></a>Even if provoked by different sayings,<br>
Of ascetics or of ordinary people,<br>
He would not answer harshly,<br>
For good people make no enemies.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc940"></a>Fully understanding this principle,<br>
An inquiring bhikkhu would always train mindfully;<br>
Knowing quenching as peace,<br>
He would not be negligent in Gotama’s teaching.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc941"></a>He overcomes, he is not overcome,<br>
Seeing the Dhamma with his own eyes, not by hearsay;<br>
Therefore he would always respectfully train in accord,<br>
Diligent in the teaching of the Buddha.</p>
