<h1>1.10. With the Yakkha Āḷavaka</h1>
</div>
<span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>:
<p>At one time the Lord dwelt at Āḷavī in the haunt of the <i>yakkha</i> Āḷavaka. Then the latter went to the Lord’s dwelling and spoke to him as follows: “Monk, come out!”</p>
<p>“Very well, friend” said the Buddha (and came out).</p>
<p>“Monk, go in!”</p>
<p>“Very well, friend” said the Buddha and entered his dwelling. He repeated these demands twice, but on the fourth demand the Buddha said:</p>
<p>“I shall not come out to you, friend, do what you will.”</p>
<p>“Monk, I shall ask you a question and if you cannot answer it I shall either overthrow your mind, split your heart, or seizing you by the feet, throw you to the other side of the Ganges river.”</p>
<p>“I do not see, friend, anyone in the world with its devas, Māras and Brahmās, in this generation with its monks and brahmins, princes and men who can either overthrow my mind, or split my heart, or seize me by the feet and throw me to the other side of the Ganges river. However, friend, ask what you will.”</p>

For humans here what wealth is best?<br>
What often done brings happiness?<br>
What surely has the sweetest taste?<br>
How living do they say “life’s best”?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc184"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
Faith the wealth for humans best,<br>
Dharma done brings happiness,<br>
Truth surely has the sweetest taste,<br>
“Lived with wisdom” this life’s best.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc185"></a><span class="speaker">Āḷavaka</span><br>
How can the flood be overcrossed?<br>
How overcrossed the sea?<br>
How <i>dukkha</i> can be overcome?<br>
How win to purity?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc186"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
By faith the flood is overcrossed.<br>
By vigilance the sea.<br>
By effort <i>dukkha</i>’s overcome.<br>
By wisdom, purity.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc187"></a><span class="speaker">Āḷavaka</span><br>
How wisdom will be won<br>
with riches also found?<br>
How attain to fame<br>
and bring together friends?<br>
When passing from this world, to next,<br>
how does one not grieve?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc188"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
One with faith in arahats’ Dharma<br>
for attainment of Nirvāṇa<br>
diligent, wishing to listen,<br>
and discerning, wisdom wins.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc189"></a>One who acts appropriately,<br>
who’s steady and industrious,<br>
finds wealth and fame, attained by truth;<br>
by giving, friends are gained.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc190"></a>A faithful household seeker has<br>
attained these four: truthfulness,<br>
virtue, courage, generosity too,<br>
and so grieves not when passing hence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc191"></a>Now if you wish, ask others too,<br>
numerous monks and brahmins—if<br>
truth, generosity, taming self,<br>
patience too—what’s better than these?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc192"></a><span class="speaker">Āḷavaka</span><br>
Why should I consult with these<br>
monks and brahmins numerous,<br>
when now for myself I know<br>
who brings my future’s benefit?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc193"></a>For my benefit truly He came here,<br>
the Buddha visiting Āḷavī.<br>
Now do I know where a gift<br>
bestowed will bear great fruit.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc194"></a>Village to village I shall roam,<br>
town to town revering him—<br>
the Full Awakened One, and<br>
the Dharmaness of perfect Dharma.</p>
