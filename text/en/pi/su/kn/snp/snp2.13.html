<h1>2.13. Perfection in the Wandering Life</h1>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc362"></a><span class="speaker">Question</span><br>
Of the Sage of great wisdom, one gone across,<br>
to the further shore gone, completely Cool, poised<br>
who’s renounced a house,<br>
sense-pleasures dispelled, I ask:<br>
How would a bhikkhu rightly wander in the world?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc363"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
Who has destroyed (belief) in omens, in luck,<br>
the occurrence of dreams and other signs such,<br>
who is rid of the bane of what is auspicious,<br>
such a one rightly would wander in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc364"></a>Who sensuality is able to divert—<br>
both varieties, human and divine—such a bhikkhu<br>
passed beyond being, knowing Dharma well,<br>
such a one rightly would wander in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc365"></a>Anger and avarice by the bhikkhu abandoned,<br>
his back having turned upon slander as well,<br>
compliance, opposition, completely disappeared,<br>
such a one rightly would wander in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc366"></a>Letting go the pleasant, what’s unpleasant too,<br>
ungrasping, unsupported by nothing at all,<br>
from all the causes for the fetters—completely free,<br>
such a one rightly would wander in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc367"></a>Seeing no essence in mental substrata,<br>
dispelled passionate desire for what can be grasped,<br>
not being dependent or led by another,<br>
such a one rightly would wander in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc368"></a>In speech, mind and deed to others unopposed<br>
and knowing very well the Dharma’s full extent,<br>
and one who is aspiring to the state of Nirvāṇa,<br>
such a one rightly would wander in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc369"></a>The bhikkhu not conceited thinking, “Me he reveres”,<br>
nor on being abused does he retaliate,<br>
nor thrilled with others donations of food,<br>
such a one rightly would wander in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc370"></a>For greed and for being, the bhikkhu’s let go,<br>
as for injury and bondage it’s not done by him<br>
crossed over doubts, removed is the dart,<br>
such a one rightly would wander in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc371"></a>A bhikkhu who knows what he himself enjoys<br>
would not be one who harms others in the world;<br>
realizing the Dharma as it really is,<br>
such a one rightly would wander in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc372"></a>in whom are no hidden tendencies at all—<br>
the roots of evil completely removed,<br>
for them no longings left, no yearnings come anew<br>
such a one rightly would wander in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc373"></a>Inﬂows eradicated and conceit let go<br>
and transcended the path of sexual desire,<br>
one tamed, completely Cool and imperturbable,<br>
such a one rightly would wander in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc374"></a>Confident and learned, one who Sees the Way,<br>
one Wise who among sects is no sectarian;<br>
who greed has diverted, hatred, ill-will too,<br>
such a one rightly would wander in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc375"></a>A conqueror—purity perfected, remover of the veil,<br>
with majesty of dharmas, far-shorer, inturbulent,<br>
skilful with knowledge of conditioned things’ cessation,<br>
such a one rightly would wander in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc376"></a>Of wisdom purified surmounting both<br>
past and the future, gone beyond time,<br>
and in every way free from sense-bases,<br>
such a one rightly would wander in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc377"></a>Final Knowledge of the State, having realized the Dharma,<br>
having seen openly the letting-go of inﬂows,<br>
with all the substrata completely dissolved,<br>
such a one rightly would wander in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc378"></a><span class="speaker">Question</span><br>
Indeed, O Blessed One, certainly it is thus,<br>
for that bhikkhu tamed, living like this—<br>
one who beyond all the fetters has passed,<br>
such a one rightly would wander in the world.</p>
