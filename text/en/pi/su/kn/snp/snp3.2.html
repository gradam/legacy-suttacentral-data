<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc428"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
As I strove to subdue myself<br>
beside the broad Nerañjarā,<br>
absorbed unflinchingly to gain<br>
the surcease of bondage here,<br>
Namucī came and spoke to me<br>
with words all garbed in pity thus:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc429"></a><span class="speaker">Māra</span><br>
O you are thin and you are pale,<br>
and you are in death’s presence too:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc430"></a>a thousand parts are pledged to death<br>
but life still holds one part of you.<br>
Live, sir! Life’s the better way;<br>
you may gain merit if you live,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc431"></a>come live the life of purity, pour<br>
libations on the holy fires<br>
and thus a world of merit gain.<br>
What can you do by struggling now?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc432"></a>The path of struggling too is rough,<br>
and difficult and hard to bear.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><span class="speaker">Narrator</span><br>
Now Māra, as he spoke these lines<br>
drew near until he stood close by.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc433"></a>The Blessed One replied to him<br>
as he stood thus:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
O Evil One,<br>
O Cousin of the Negligent,<br>
you have come here for your own ends.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc434"></a>Now, merit I need not at all.<br>
Let Māra talk of merit then,<br>
to those that stand in need of it.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc435"></a>For I have faith and energy,<br>
and I have understanding, too.<br>
So while I thus subdue myself,<br>
why do you speak to me of life?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc436"></a>There is this wind that blows, can dry<br>
even the rivers’ running streams;<br>
so while I thus subdue myself,<br>
why should it not dry up my blood?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc437"></a>And, as the blood dries up, then bile<br>
and phlegm run dry, the wasting flesh<br>
becalms the mind: I shall have more<br>
of mindfulness and wisdom too,<br>
I shall have greater concentration.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc438"></a>For living thus I come to know<br>
the limits to which feeling goes.<br>
My mind looks not to sense-desires:<br>
Now see a being’s purity.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc439"></a>Your squadron’s first is Sense-desires<br>
your second’s Sexual Discontent,<br>
Hunger and Thirst compose the third,<br>
and Craving is the fourth in rank,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc440"></a>the fifth is Sloth and Accidy,<br>
while Fear is called the sixth in line,<br>
Sceptical doubt is seventh, the eighth<br>
is Sliminess, Hardheartedness;</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc441"></a>Gain with Honour, Praise besides,<br>
and ill-won Notoriety,<br>
Self-praise and Denigrating others—</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc442"></a>These are your squadrons, Namucī,<br>
the Black One’s fighting troops.<br>
None but the brave will conquer them<br>
to gain bliss by the victory.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc443"></a>As though I’m weaving <i>muñja</i>-grass,<br>
proclaiming no retreat: shame upon life<br>
defeated here—better to die in battle now<br>
than choose to live on in defeat.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc444"></a>Ascetics and brahmins there are found<br>
that have surrendered here, and they<br>
are seen no more: they do not know<br>
the paths the pilgrim travels by.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc445"></a>So, seeing Māra’s squadrons now<br>
arrayed all round, with elephants,<br>
I sally forth to fight, that I<br>
may not be driven from my post.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc446"></a>Your serried squadrons, which the world<br>
with all its gods cannot defeat,<br>
Now I’ll break with wisdom sharp,<br>
as with a stone a raw clay pot.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="22"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc447"></a>With all mind’s thoughts within the range,<br>
with well-established mindfulness,<br>
I’ll travel on from state to state<br>
many disciples leading out.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="23"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc448"></a>They, both diligent and resolute<br>
carry on my <i>Sāsana</i>,<br>
and though you like it not, they’ll go<br>
to where they do not grieve.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="24"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc449"></a><span class="speaker">Māra</span><br>
Though step by step for seven years<br>
I’ve followed on the Blessed One,<br>
the Fully Enlightened One, possessed<br>
of mindfulness, he gave to me no chance.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="25"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc450"></a>A crow there was who walked around<br>
a stone that seemed a lump of fat;<br>
“Shall I find something soft in this?<br>
And is there something tasty here?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="26"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc451"></a>He finding nothing tasty there,<br>
made off: and we from Gotama<br>
depart in disappointment, too,<br>
like to the crow that tried the stone.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="27"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc452"></a><span class="speaker">Narrator</span><br>
Then full of sorrow he let slip<br>
the lute from underneath his arm,<br>
then that dejected demon<br>
disappeared just there.</p>
