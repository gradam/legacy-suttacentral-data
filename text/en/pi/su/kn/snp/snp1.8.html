<h1>1.8. Loving-kindness</h1>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc143"></a>What should be done by one<br>
who is skilled in wholesomeness,<br>
to gain the State of Peacefulness is this:<br>
One should be able, upright, straight and not proud,<br>
easy to speak to, mild and well content,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc144"></a>easily satisfied and not caught up<br>
in too much bustle, and frugal in one’s ways,<br>
with senses calmed, intelligent, not bold,<br>
not being covetous when with other folk,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc145"></a>not even doing little things that other wise ones blame.<br>
(And this the thought that one should always hold):<br>
“May beings all live happily and safe,<br>
and may their hearts rejoice within themselves.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc146"></a>Whatever there may be with breath of life,<br>
whether they be frail or very strong,<br>
without exception, be they long or short,<br>
or middle-sized, or be big or small,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc147"></a>or dense, or visible or invisible,<br>
or whether they dwell far or they dwell near,<br>
those that are here, those seeking to exist—<br>
may beings all rejoice with themselves.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc148"></a>Let no one bring about another’s ruin<br>
and not despise in any way or place;<br>
let them not wish each other any ill<br>
from provocation or from enmity.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc149"></a>Just as a mother at the risk of life<br>
loves and protects her child, her only child,<br>
so one should cultivate this bondless love<br>
to all that live in the whole universe—</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc150"></a>extending from a consciousness sublime<br>
upwards and downwards and across the world,<br>
untroubled, free from hate and enmity.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc151"></a>And while one stands and while one sits<br>
or when one lies down still free from drowsiness,<br>
one should be intent on this mindfulness—<br>
this is divine abiding here they say.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc152"></a>But when one lives quite free from any view,<br>
is virtuous, with perfect insight won,<br>
and greed for selfish desires let go,<br>
one surely comes no more to be reborn.</p>
