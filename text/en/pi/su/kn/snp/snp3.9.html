<h1>3.9 To Vāseṭṭha on Who is a Brahmin</h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>:</p>
<p>At one time the Radiant One was dwelling at Icchānaṅgala. Now at that time a number of notable and prosperous brahmins were staying at lcchānangala, that is to say the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jāṇussoni and Todeyya, as well as other notable and prosperous brahmins.</p>
<p>Then, as the young brahmins Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvaia were walking and wandering for exercise this subject of discussion arose between them. “How is one a brahmin?” The young brahmin Bhāradvaja said, “When one is well-born on both sides, of pure maternal and paternal descent through seven generations in the past, then one is a brahmin”.</p>
<p>But Vāseṭṭha the young brahmin said, “When one is virtuous and fulfils one’s vows, then one is a brahmin”. Bhāradvaja could not convince Vāseṭṭha while the latter failed to convince the former.</p>
<p>Then Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvaja, “Sir, the samaṇa Gotama son of the Sakyas who left home from the Sakyan clan is living at Icchānaṅgala, in the forest near Icchānaṅgala. Now the good reputation of Master Gotama has spread in this way: ‘That Radiant One is accomplished, completely Awakened, possessed of True Knowledge and conduct, well-gone for himself and others, knower of the worlds, unexcelled trainer of those who can be tamed, teacher of devas and humanity, Awake and Radiant.’ Come, Bhāradvaja, let us go to the samaṇa Gotama and ask him about this. As he replies, so will we bear his words in mind.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir”, Bharadvaja replied.</p>
<p>So the two young brahmins approached the Radiant One and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was concluded, they sat down to one side, and the young brahmin Vāseṭṭha addressed the Radiant One in verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc600"></a><span class="speaker">Vāseṭṭha</span><br>
Of Pokkharasāti the pupil I am,<br>
while student of Tārukkha is he;<br>
both of us have acknowledged mastery<br>
in the threefold Veda lore.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc601"></a>We have attained totality<br>
over all the Vedic masters teach;<br>
as philologists, grammarians,<br>
and we chant as our masters do.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc602"></a>The subject of “birth”, O Gotama,<br>
is contention’s cause with us:<br>
he, a Bhāradvāja, does declare<br>
“birth” is due to brahmin caste,<br>
while I say its by karma caused:<br>
know its thus, O One-with-Eyes.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc603"></a>Sir, to ask about this we have come,<br>
to you acclaimed as Wide Awake,<br>
each of us unable is<br>
the other to convince.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc604"></a>As they raise their lotussed hands<br>
towards the moon waxed full,<br>
so to you, by this world revered,<br>
we pay homage too.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc605"></a>So now of Gotama the Eye<br>
uprisen in the world, we ask:<br>
Is one by “birth” a brahmin,<br>
or a brahmin karma-caused?<br>
Explain to us who do not know<br>
how we should “brahmin” recognize?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc606"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
I shall analyse for you,<br>
in order due and as they are,<br>
the types of “birth” ’mong living things,<br>
for many are the sorts of birth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc607"></a>First, there’s grasses and the trees,<br>
though of themselves they nothing know,<br>
each species possessing its own marks,<br>
for many are the sorts of birth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc608"></a>Next come beetles, butterflies,<br>
and so on to the termites, ants,<br>
each species possessing its own marks,<br>
for many are the sorts of birth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc609"></a>Then, know of those four-footed kinds,<br>
both the tiny and the huge,<br>
each species possessing its own marks<br>
for many are the sorts of birth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc610"></a>Know those whose bellies are their feet,<br>
that is, the long-backed group of snakes,<br>
each species possessing its own marks,<br>
for many are the sorts of birth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc611"></a>Know too the many kinds of fish,<br>
living in their watery world,<br>
each species possessing its own marks,<br>
for many are the sorts of birth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc612"></a>Then know the varied winged ones,<br>
the birds that range the open skies,<br>
each species possessing its own marks,<br>
for many are the sorts of birth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc613"></a>While in those births are differences,<br>
each having their own distinctive marks,<br>
among humanity such differences<br>
of species—no such marks are found.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc614"></a>Neither in hair, nor in the head,<br>
not in the ears or eyes,<br>
neither found in mouth or nose,<br>
not in lips or brows.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc615"></a>Neither in neck, nor shoulders found,<br>
not in belly or the back,<br>
neither in buttocks nor the breast,<br>
not in groin or sexual parts.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc616"></a>Neither in hands nor in the feet,<br>
not in fingers or the nails,<br>
neither in knees nor in the thighs,<br>
not in their “colour”, not in sound,<br>
here is no distinctive mark<br>
as in the many other sorts of birth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc617"></a>In human bodies as they are,<br>
such differences cannot be found:<br>
the only human differences<br>
are those in names alone.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc618"></a>’Mong humankind whoever lives<br>
by raising cattle on a farm,<br>
O Vāseṭṭha you should know<br>
as farmer not as Brahmin then.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc626"></a>Him I call not a brahmin, though<br>
born from brahmin mother’s line,<br>
if with sense of ownership,<br>
he’s just supercilious:<br>
owning nothing and unattached—<br>
one such I say’s a Brahmin then.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc627"></a>Who fetters all has severed,<br>
who trembles not at all,<br>
gone beyond ties, free from bonds—<br>
one such I say’s a Brahmin then.</p>

among the violent, cool,<br>
detached amid the passionate—<br>

conceit, contempt have dropped away,<br>
as mustard seed from needle-point—<br>
one such I say’s a Brahmin then.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc638"></a>Who utters speech instructive,<br>
true and gentle too,<br>
who gives offence to none—<br>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc639"></a>Who in the world will never take<br>
what is not given, long or short,<br>
the great or small, the fair or foul—<br>
one such I say’s a Brahmin then.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc640"></a>In whom there are not longings found<br>
for this world or the next,<br>
longingless and free from bonds—<br>
on such I say’s a Brahmin then.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc641"></a>In whom is no dependence found,<br>
with Final Knowledge, free from doubt,<br>
duly wont to the Deathless deeps—<br>
one such I say’s a Brahmin then.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc642"></a>Here who’s gone beyond both bonds:<br>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc644"></a>Who’s overpassed this difficult path,<br>
delusion’s bond, the wandering-on,<br>

one such I say’s a Brahmin then.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc645"></a>Who has abandoned sense desires,<br>
as homeless one renouncing all,<br>
desire for being all consumed—<br>

become quite cool and assetless<br>
A hero, All-worlds conqueror,<br>
one such I say’s a Brahmin then</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc649"></a>Whoever knows of being’ death,<br>
their being born in every way,<br>
unshackled, faring well, Awake—<br>
one such I say’s a Brahmin then.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc650"></a>Whose destination is unknown<br>
to humans, spirits or to gods,<br>
pollutions faded, Arahat—<br>
one such I say’s a Brahmin then.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc651"></a>For whom there is not ownership<br>
before or after or midway,<br>
owning nothing and unattached—<br>
one such I say’s a Brahmin then.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc652"></a>One noble, most excellent, heroic too,<br>
the great sage and the one who conquers all,<br>
who’s faultless, washes, one Awake—<br>
one such I say’s a Brahmin then.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc653"></a>Who knows their former births<br>
and sees the states of bliss and woe<br>
and then who wins the waste of births—<br>
one such I say’s a Brahmin then.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc654"></a>Whatever’s accepted and “name” and “clan”<br>
is just a worldly designation—<br>
by conventions handed down<br>
accepted everywhere.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc655"></a>But those asleep, unquestioning,<br>
who take up views, who do not Know,<br>
unknowingly they’ve long declared:<br>
one’s a brahmin just by “birth”.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc656"></a>One’s not a brahmin caused by “birth”,<br>
nor caused by “birth” a non-brahmin;<br>
a brahmin’s one by karma caused,<br>
by karma caused a non-brahmin.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc657"></a>By karma caused a farmer is,<br>
one’s a craftsman karma-caused,<br>
by karma caused a merchant is,<br>
one’s a servant karma-caused.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc658"></a>By karma caused a robber is,<br>
one’s a soldier karma-caused,<br>
by karma caused a priest becomes,<br>
one’s a ruler karma-caused.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc659"></a>Thus according as it is<br>
people wise do karma see;<br>
Seers of causal relatedness,<br>
skilled in karma, its results.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc660"></a>Karma makes the world go on,<br>
people by karma, circle round;<br>
sentient beings are bound to karma,<br>
as a cart is pulled by a horse.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc661"></a>By ardour and the Good Life leading,<br>
with restraint and taming too:<br>
by this a Brahmin one becomes,<br>
one’s by this a Brahmin best.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc662"></a>Possessed of Triple Knowledges,<br>
at Peace, rebirth come to an end—<br>
know Vāseṭṭha, such a one<br>
is Brahmā and Sakra for those who Know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When this was said the young brahmins Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja exclaimed to the Radiant One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! The Dharma has been clarified by Master Gotama in many ways, as though he was lighting what was overthrown revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes can see forms. We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dharma and to the Saṅgha. May Master Gotama remember us as <i>upāsakas</i> who from today have Gone for Refuge for life.</p>
