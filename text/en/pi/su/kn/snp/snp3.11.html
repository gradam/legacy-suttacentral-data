<h3>Prologue—Telling the story</h3>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc685"></a><span class="speaker">Narrator</span><br>
In midday meditation the sage Asita saw<br>
brilliantly arrayed the thrice-ten deva troop,<br>
happy and joyful waving flags the while,<br>
with Sakka their superior all highly elated.<br>
<a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc686"></a>Then when he had seen the devas so delighted<br>
respectfully he greeted them and questioned them like this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Why is this deva-Saṅgha so exceedingly joyful<br>
they’ve brought along banners for brandishing about?<br>
<a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc687"></a>Even when the devas battled anti-gods<br>
with a win for deva-hosts, and loss for demon-hordes,<br>
then was no such celebration— so what have devas seen?<br>
What wonder have they heard? Why devas are delighted?<br>
<a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc688"></a>They whistle and they sing, clap hands and strum sitars;<br>
with dancing and with music, so they celebrate.<br>
O you deva-dwellers on Meru’s airy peaks,<br>
I beg you, good sirs, soon dispel my doubts.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc689"></a><span class="speaker">Devas</span><br>
A Bodhisattva has been born in the Sakyans’ city,<br>
in lands along Lumbini. Precious gem beyond compare,<br>
for the weal and welfare of those in the human realm.<br>
That’s why we’re delighted and completely overjoyed.<br>
<a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc690"></a>He, best being of all, foremost among mankind,<br>
mighty bull among men, of creatures all supreme,<br>
will revolve the wheel in ancient seers’ woods,<br>
likened to a roaring lion, mightiest of beasts.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc691"></a><span class="speaker">Narrator</span><br>
Having known this news, then the sage in haste<br>
in mind descended to Suddhodana’s abode,<br>
sat he down and said:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><span class="speaker">Asita</span> Where then is this prince? I wish to see him now!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc692"></a><span class="speaker">Narrator</span><br>
So Sakyans he beseeched.<br>
Then to him Asita named did Sakyans show their son,<br>
the prince in colour clear as rays from shining gold,<br>
burnished and illustrious both of supernal hue.<br>
<a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc693"></a>Joy with rapture great filled Asita’s heart<br>
on perceiving this young prince, bright as crested flame,<br>
pure like the lunar lord stars herding through the sky,<br>
dazzling as the sun on cloudless autumn days.<br>
<a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc694"></a>Sky beings all above carried canopy of state<br>
of many-tiered parasols as well as gold-handled whisks—<br>
but no one saw the bearers of the whisks and parasols.<br>
<a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc695"></a>The sage with dreadlocked hair, also Kaṇhasiri called,<br>
seeing then the prince— golden jewel upon brocade,<br>
white parasols of state held above his head—<br>
received him in his arms with gladdened mind and joy.<br>
<a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc696"></a>As soon as he received the foremost Sakyan man,<br>
he, skilled in lore of signs and mastery of mantras,<br>
exclaimed:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><span class="speaker">Asita</span><br>
Highest, unexcelled among the race of men!<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc697"></a><span class="speaker">Narrator</span><br>
But recollected then that soon, so soon, he’d die.<br>
Seeing the sobbing prince, the Sakyans asked of him:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><span class="speaker">Sakyans</span><br>
Surely for this prince no peril will befall?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc698"></a><span class="speaker">Narrator</span><br>
The sage in answer said to anxious Sakyan’s throng:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><span class="speaker">Asita</span><br>
“No fears do I foresee to come upon the prince,<br>
nor any harm at all in future will befall,<br>
nor he’s unfortunate, so do not be depressed,<br>
<a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc699"></a>for he will touch upon Enlightenment divine<br>
and turn the Dharma wheel. Seer of perfect purity,<br>
with compassion for the many, he will set forth the goodly life.<br>
<a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc700"></a>But I’ve only brief time left within my life,<br>
while in this time I’ll die, having no chance to hear<br>
the Dharma of that one of power incomparable;<br>
this saddens me so, such loss distresses me.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc701"></a><span class="speaker">Narrator</span><br>
Having roused in Sakyans this joy profound, the sage,<br>
keeper of pure precepts, left inner palace suites.<br>
Then of his compassion to his sister’s son set out,<br>
arousing in him interest in the Dharma deep:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc702"></a><span class="speaker">Asita</span><br>
From persons having heard the sound of “Buddha” word<br>
who Sambodhi attained, practising the Dharma-path,<br>
go there, then question him, as his disciples live with him.<br>
Practice with that radiant lord precepts of purity.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc703"></a><span class="speaker">Narrator</span><br>
So, instructed by him, whose mind set on benefit,<br>
who foresaw in future time perfect purity complete,<br>
that Nālaka, his nephew much merit stored away,<br>
with guarded senses waited in expectation of the victor.<br>
<a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc704"></a>Having heard of the victor’s revolution of the noble wheel,<br>
he went to him and saw him, that prime among the saviours,<br>
and trust arose in him in the greatest sage.<br>
Then he enquired upon the Silentness supreme,<br>
thus coming to fulfil the sages wish.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc705"></a><span class="speaker">Nālaka</span><br>
Having understood Asita’s speech—<br>
that it accords with truthfulness,<br>
Gotama, we question you<br>
on dharmas gone to the further shore.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc706"></a>I came to homelessness but now I wish<br>
as a bhikkhu to behave,<br>
speak to me, Sage, as I request<br>
on the highest state of Silentness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc707"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
Knowledge of Silence I’ll convey,<br>
hard to do, to master difficult,<br>
so be both firm and resolute<br>
and I’ll speak upon this thing.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc708"></a>In town there’s always praise and blame,<br>
so practise even-mindedness,<br>
guard against faults of mind—<br>
fare calm and free from arrogance.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc709"></a>As crown-fire crests<br>
and forest-fuel flies up,<br>
so do women tempt the sage—<br>
but be not by them tempted.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc710"></a>Refrain from sexual dharmas,<br>
whether pleasures fine or coarse,<br>
be not attached, repelled,<br>
for beings weak or strong.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc711"></a>Comparing others with oneself—<br>
“As I am so are they” and<br>
“As they are so am I”—<br>
kill not nor cause to kill.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="22"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc712"></a>Wishes and greed give up to which<br>
ordinary persons are attached,<br>
be one-with-vision and set out<br>
to go across this hellish state.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="23"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc713"></a>Empty-bellied, with little food,<br>
few in wishes, greedless too,<br>
the wishless he, and hungerless,<br>
the wishless come quite Cool.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="24"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc714"></a>The sage on almsround having walked,<br>
going then to lonely woods<br>
and drawing near the roots of a tree,<br>
takes a seat just there.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="25"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc715"></a>Firmly intent on <i>jhāna</i><br>
and delighting in the woods;<br>
who at the tree-roots meditates,<br>
satisfies himself.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="26"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc716"></a>Until the end of night,<br>
when to a village he goes,<br>
there, by gifts not pleased<br>
nor by invitations.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="27"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc717"></a>The sage to village come,<br>
hastens not among the houses,<br>
but cuts off talk while seeking food,<br>
and refrains from hints.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="28"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc718"></a>“Good it is that I have gained”,<br>
“good that I have not as well”.<br>
One such thinks both alike<br>
returning to his tree.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="29"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc719"></a>Going about with bowl in hand<br>
not dumb but others think him so;<br>
he does not scorn a trifling gift,<br>
nor despise its donor.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="30"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc720"></a>Refined and basic practices<br>
the Samaṇa’s made clear;<br>
but Beyond with both they not go,<br>
nor through one only experience.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="31"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc721"></a>In whom no craving’s left—<br>
that bhikkhu cut across the stream,<br>
“should do, should not do”, given up,<br>
in him no fever’s found.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="32"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc722"></a>Further than this, wisdom still I teach:<br>
Be like a razor’s edge,<br>
tongue-tip upon the palate,<br>
thus be restrained in belly.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="33"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc723"></a>Be not indolent in mind,<br>
but neither think too much,<br>
and be free from all carrion-stench:<br>
aim at life of purity.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="34"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc724"></a>Train yourself in solitary life,<br>
the way of life of <i>samaṇas</i>,<br>
take high delight in being one<br>
its called the Singleness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="35"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc725"></a>With this you will shine forth<br>
in all directions ten,<br>
then the praises of the wise, those skilled<br>
in meditation—sensuality let go,<br>
as one loving me, you’ll all the more<br>
grow in faith and modesty.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="36"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc726"></a>Know this from waters’ flow—<br>
those by rocks and pools—<br>
such rills and becks gush noisily,<br>
great waterways flow quiet.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="37"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc727"></a>What is unfilled makes noise<br>
but silent is what’s full,<br>
the fool is like the pot half-filled,<br>
the wise one’s like a lake that’s full.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="38"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc728"></a>When a <i>samaṇa</i> speaks much<br>
full of goodness and meaning:<br>
Knowing Dharma he speaks,<br>
Knowing he speaks so much.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="39"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc729"></a>But who, Knowing, is self-restrained,<br>
Knowing, he speaks not much:<br>
That Sage is worth to Silence,<br>
a Sage to Silence reached.</p>
