<h1>4.7 To Tissametteyya on the Disadvantages of Sex</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc821"></a><span class="speaker">Tissa</span><br>
Attached to sexual intercourse:<br>
Sir, tell its disadvantages,<br>
having heard your Teaching then,<br>
secluded we will train ourselves.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc822"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
Attached to sexual intercourse,<br>
forgetful of the Teaching then,<br>
wrong things that person practices,<br>
and does what is not Noble.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc823"></a>Who formerly fared on alone<br>
but now in sex indulges,<br>
“Low” they say’s that common worldly one,<br>
like vehicle swerving off the track.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc824"></a>That one who had renown and fame—<br>
that, for sure, diminishes,<br>
having seen this, train yourself,<br>
renouncing sexual intercourse.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc825"></a>Overcome by (lustful) thoughts,<br>
that one broods as a beggar does,<br>
and hearing reproach of others, then<br>
such a person is depressed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc826"></a>For yourself creating “arms”<br>
of others reprimanding words,<br>
so with great entanglement<br>
sinks down into untruthfulness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc827"></a>Well-known as “one who’s wise”<br>
when vowing to the single life,<br>
but later then engaged in sex<br>
will be “a fool defiled”.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc828"></a>The disadvantage having known,<br>
the sage, at start and afterwards,<br>
should stablish fast the single life,<br>
having no recourse to sex.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc829"></a>So train yourself in solitude,<br>
for that’s the life of Noble Ones,<br>
but not conceive oneself as “best”—<br>
them near indeed to Nirvāṇa.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc830"></a>The sage who’s rid of sense-desires,<br>
who to them’s indifferent,<br>
who’s crossed the flood, is envied then,<br>
by those enmeshed with pleasures of sense.</p>
