<h1>4.6. Ageing and Decay</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc811"></a>Short indeed is this life—<br>
within a hundred years one dies,<br>
and, if any live longer<br>
then they die of decay.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc812"></a>People grieve for what is “mine”:<br>
though possessions are not permanent<br>
and subject to destruction—<br>
see this and homeless dwell.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc813"></a>In death it’s all abandoned,<br>
yet still some think “it’s mine”;<br>
knowing this, the wise to me devoted<br>
should stoop not making it “owned”.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc814"></a>As one who’s waking then sees not<br>
the things that happened in sleep;<br>
so the beloved are not seen—<br>
departed and done their time.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc815"></a>People now are seen and heard<br>
and this are called by name,<br>
but alone will the name remain<br>
in speaking of those gone.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc816"></a>In “mine-making” greedy, they do not let go<br>
of sorrow, lamenting and avarice,<br>
therefore sages leaving possessions<br>
freely wander, seers of security.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc817"></a>For a bhikkhu practicing in solitude,<br>
keeping company with secluded mind,<br>
of such a one are all agreed:<br>
“In being he’ll not be seen again”.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc818"></a>In all matters the sage is unsupported,<br>
nothing that makes dear, nor undear,<br>
sorrow and avarice do not stain that one,<br>
As water does not stay upon a leaf.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc819"></a>As a water-drop on lotus plant,<br>
as water does not stain a lotus flower,<br>
even so the sage is never stained<br>
by seen, heard, or whatever’s cognized.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc820"></a>Certainly the wise do not conceive<br>
upon the seen, the heard, and cognized,<br>
nor wish for purity through another,<br>
for they are not attached nor yet displeased.</p>
