<h1>2.7 How Brahmins Lived by the Dharma</h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>:</p>
<p>At one time the Radiant One dwelt at Sāvatthī, in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Then many decrepit old Kosalan brahmins, aged, elderly, advanced in years, attained to old age, those indeed of palatial abodes, went to the Radiant One and exchanged greeting with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished they sat down to one side. Sitting there these brahmins of palatial abodes said, “Master Gotama, are there now to be seen any brahmins who practise the Brahmin Dharma of the brahmins of old?”</p>
<p>“No, brahmins, there are no brahmins now to be seen who practise the Brahmin Dharma of the brahmins of old.”</p>
<p>“It would be excellent if the good Gotama would speak to us upon the Dharma of the brahmins of old if it would not be too much trouble.”</p>
<p>“Then brahmins, listen well and bear in mind what I shall say”.</p>
<p>“Indeed, venerable” said those brahmins of palatial abodes to the Radiant One. He spoke as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc287"></a>In ancient times the sages then<br>
austerely lived, were self-restrained,<br>
let go five bases of desire<br>
to fare for their own benefit.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc288"></a>Brahmins then no cattle had,<br>
no gold, no grain they hoarded up,<br>
their grain, their wealth was Vedic lore—<br>
this the treasure they guarded well.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc289"></a>For them, whatever food prepared<br>
was by the doorway placed<br>
from faith prepared for those who sought,<br>
for (donors) thought it should be given.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc290"></a>Then in various states and provinces<br>
rich in colourful cloths well-dyed<br>
with furniture and dwellings too<br>
with these to brahmins they paid respect.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc291"></a>Unbeaten were brahmins and inviolate—<br>
guarded by Dharma-goodness then,<br>
none hindered or obstructed them<br>
when they arrived at household doors.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc292"></a>Until the age of eight-and-forty<br>
they practised celibate student life—<br>
the brahmins of those ancient times<br>
fared seeking knowledge and conduct good.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc293"></a>Those brahmins went not to others’ wives<br>
nor bought a wife from other clans;<br>
by mutual consent together they came,<br>
being happy with each other.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc294"></a>Brahmins then did not indulge<br>
in sexual intercourse out of time,<br>
during menstruation,<br>
but only when wives were free from this.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc295"></a>The celibate life was praised by them<br>
with virtue and uprightness,<br>
friendliness, penance and gentleness,<br>
harming none and patient too.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc296"></a>Whoso ’mong them strong efforts made<br>
resembling Brahma, best,<br>
he never did engage in sex<br>
not even in a dream.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc297"></a>Then some of them with wisdom blest<br>
followed his practice path<br>
praising the celibate life, as well<br>
as virtue and as patience too.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc298"></a>Having begged rice, butter and oil,<br>
with cloths and bedding too,<br>
they sought and stored these righteously,<br>
and from them made a sacrifice:<br>
during that sacrificial rite<br>
cattle they never killed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc299"></a>Like mother (they thought), father, brother<br>
or any other kind of kin,<br>
cows are our kin most excellent<br>
from whom come many remedies.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc300"></a>Givers of good and strength, of good<br>
complexion and the happiness of health,<br>
having seen the truth of this<br>
cattle they never killed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc301"></a>Those brahmins then by Dharma did<br>
what should be done, not what should not,<br>
and so aware they graceful were,<br>
well-built, fair-skinned, of high renown.<br>
While in the world this lore was found<br>
these people happily prospered.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc302"></a>But then in them corruption came<br>
for little by little they observed<br>
how rajahs had to splendours won<br>
with women adorned and elegant,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc303"></a>and chariot, yoked to thoroughbreds,<br>
caparisoned, embroideries finely sewn,<br>
and houses well-designed with walls—<br>
insides divided into rooms,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc304"></a>filled with crowds of women fair<br>
and ringed by herds of increasing cows—<br>
all this the eminent wealth of men<br>
the brahmins coveted in their hearts.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc305"></a>Then they composed some Vedic hymns<br>
and went chanting to Okkāka king:<br>
“Great your wealth and great your grain,<br>
make sacrifice to us with grain and wealth”.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc306"></a>That rajah, Lord of chariots,<br>
by brahmins was persuaded so<br>
he offered all these sacrifices:<br>
of horses, men, the peg well-thrown,<br>
the sacrifice of soma drink<br>
the one of rich results—<br>
while to the brahmins wealth he gave:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc307"></a>of cattle, bedding and of cloth<br>
with women adorned and elegant<br>
and chariots yoked to thoroughbreds<br>
caparisoned, embroideries finely sewn,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc308"></a>dwelling in which one would delight,<br>
these well-divided into rooms<br>
and many different kinds of grain,<br>
this wealth he to the brahmins gave.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc309"></a>When they had all this wealth received<br>
to hoard it up was their desire<br>
for they were overwhelmed by greed—<br>
their craving thus increased—<br>
so they composed more Vedic hymns<br>
and chanting went to Okkāka king.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc310"></a>“As water is, and earth, as well<br>
as gold, as grain as well as wealth,<br>
in the same way for human beings,<br>
and cattle are necessities;<br>
Great your wealth and great your grain,<br>
make sacrifice to us with grain and wealth”.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc311"></a>That rajah, lord of chariots,<br>
by brahmins was persuaded—so<br>
in sacrifice, he caused to kill<br>
cattle in hundreds, thousands too.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc312"></a>But neither with hooves nor horns<br>
do cows cause harm to anyone,<br>
gentle they are as sheep<br>
yielding us pails of milk;<br>
in spite of this the rajah seized<br>
their horns, slew them by the sword.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc313"></a>Then devas, antigods, demons, led<br>
by Indra, even the ancestors,<br>
cried out “Against the Dharma is all this!”<br>
while fell the sword upon the cows.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc314"></a>In former times three ills were found:<br>
desire and hunger and decay;<br>
but due to the killing of cattle,<br>
ninety-eight diseases came.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc315"></a>This adharmic wielding of weapons,<br>
descended from times of old:<br>
in this are the innocents slain,<br>
while ritual priests from Dharma fell.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc316"></a>So this ancient practice, base,<br>
is censured by the wise;<br>
where similar things are seen,<br>
people blame the ritual priests.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc317"></a>When Dharma was perverted thus,<br>
merchants and workers split apart,<br>
and warrior-nobles split as well,<br>
while wife her husband did despise.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc318"></a>Then nobles and those of Brahmā “kin”<br>
and others restrained by love of caste,<br>
neglected then their laws on “birth”<br>
and under the sway of pleasures came.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When this was said the brahmins of palatial abodes exclaimed to the Radiant One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! The Dharma has been clarified by Master Gotama in many ways, as though he was fighting what had been overturned, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms. We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dharma and to the Saṅgha. May Master Gotama remember us as <i>upāsakas</i> who from today have Gone for Refuge for life.”</p>
