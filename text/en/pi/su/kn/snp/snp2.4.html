<h1>The Greatest Good Fortune</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">This is what I have heard</span>. At one time the Blessed One was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. On that occasion, as the night was coming to an end, a certain god of great beauty approached the Blessed One while illuminating the whole Jeta Grove. After bowing to the Blessed One, they stood to one side and spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Many gods and humans,<br>
Desiring well-being,<br>
Are seekers of good fortune:<br>
Please tell me the greatest good fortune.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Not to associate with fools,<br>
But to associate with the wise,<br>
And to honour those worthy of honour:<br>
This is the greatest good fortune.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“To live in a suitable place,<br>
Having previously done good karma,<br>
And to apply oneself in the right way:<br>
This is the greatest good fortune.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“To be educated and to have a vocation,<br>
To be well-trained in one’s chosen field,<br>
And to speak words that are well-spoken:<br>
This is the greatest good fortune.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“To support one’s mother and father,<br>
To cherish one’s partner and children,<br>
And to have a job without stress:<br>
This is the greatest good fortune.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“Generosity and an upright life,<br>
Kindness towards one’s relatives,<br>
And the doing of blameless deeds:<br>
This is the greatest good fortune.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“To refrain from what is unwholesome,<br>
To abstain from all intoxicants,<br>
And to be steadfast in good qualities,<br>
This is the greatest good fortune.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“Respect and humility,<br>
Contentment and gratitude,<br>
And the timely hearing of Dharma:<br>
This is the greatest good fortune.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>“Being patient and easy to correct,<br>
The seeing of monks and nuns,<br>
And timely discussion on Dharma:<br>
This is the greatest good fortune.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>“Asceticism and the spiritual life,<br>
Insight into the noble truths,<br>
And the seeing for oneself of Nirvana:<br>
This is the greatest good fortune.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>“A mind that remains unshaken<br>
By the ups and the downs of the world,<br>
Sorrowless, stainless and safe:<br>
This is the greatest good fortune.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>“Having performed these things,<br>
Nowhere can they be conquered—<br>
They are secure wherever they go.<br>
This is their greatest good fortune.”</p>
