<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At one time the Radiant one was dwelling at Jeta’s Grove in the park of Anāthapiṇḍika near Sāvatthī. Then as the night was ending a deva of surpassing radiance, illuminating the whole of Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Radiant One and stood to one side after saluting him. Standing there that deva addressed the Radiant One with a verse:</p>
