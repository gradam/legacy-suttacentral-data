<h1>2.9. What is Good Conduct?</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc327"></a><span class="speaker">Sāriputta</span><br>
With what kinds of conduct and morality,<br>
growing in what sorts of karmas,<br>
will a person well-established be<br>
for attainment of the highest goal?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc328"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
Let that one be an honourer of elders, never envious,<br>
a knower of the right time for the teacher seeing,<br>
and when Dharma’s being taught, a knower of that time<br>
to listen precisely to those well-spoken words.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc329"></a>And at the right time go to the teacher’s presence<br>
in an unassuming way, discarding obstinacy,<br>
with restraint and recollection of the way to practise,<br>
remembering the Dharma for the life of purity.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc330"></a>Dwelling in the Dharma, delighted in Dharma,<br>
in Dharma established, and skilled in deciding Dharma,<br>
never uttering words to the Dharma’s detriment,<br>
Let such a one be guided by well-spoken truths.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc331"></a>Disputatiousness, gossip, complaints and ill-will,<br>
deception, hypocrisy, longing and pride,<br>
aggressiveness, harshness, defilements-attached,<br>
fare abandoning these, pride-free, of steady mind.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc332"></a>Understanding’s the essence of well-spoken words,<br>
while that and the learnt is the essence of calmness;<br>
but wisdom and learning in one do not grow—<br>
that person who’s hasty and negligent both.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc333"></a>Delighting in Dharma by Noble Ones taught,<br>
their mind, speech and body all unsurpassed—<br>
in gentleness, peace, meditative-states firm,<br>
attained to the essence of wisdom and learning.</p>
