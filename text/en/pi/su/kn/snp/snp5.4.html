“I have come in need with a question:<br>
On account of what did the seers and men,<br>
nobles, and brahmins, here in the world<br>
offer many sacrifices to the gods?<br>
I ask you, Gracious One, please tell this to me.”</p>

“nobles, and brahmins, here in the world,<br>
offered many sacrifices to the gods,<br>
they did so yearning, Puṇṇaka, for mundane existence,<br>
on account of old age, they offered sacrifices.”</p>

“nobles, and brahmins, here in the world,<br>
offered many sacrifices to the gods,<br>
O Gracious One, perhaps those heedful of the path of sacrifice<br>
have crossed over birth and old age, dear Sir?<br>
I ask you, Gracious One, please tell this to me.”</p>

“They hunger for sense pleasures, because of gain<br>
they engage in sacrifice, excited by the passion for existence.<br>
They have not crossed over birth and old age, I say.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1054"></a><a class="snp-vagga-verse" id="snp-vagga-verse5.72"></a><a class="verse-num-pts" id="verse-num-pts1047"></a><a class="snp-vagga-section-verse" id="snp-vagga-section-verse5.4.5"></a>“If those engaged in sacrifice have not crossed over,” said venerable Puṇṇaka,<br>
“birth and old age by their sacrifices, dear Sir,<br>
then just who in the world of the Gods and men<br>
has crossed over birth and old age, dear Sir?<br>
I ask you, Gracious One, please tell this to me.”</p>

“who has no turmoil anywhere in the world,<br>
who is peaceful, not incensed, not troubled, not yearning,<br>
he has crossed over birth and old age, I say.”</p>
