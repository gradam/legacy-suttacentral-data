<p>This was said by the Gracious One while living among the Magadhans at the Pāsāṇaka shrine. The sixteen attendent brahmins requested, asked, and asked, and he answered the questions. If, knowing the meaning of each question, knowing the Teaching, he would practice in conformity with the Teaching, he would surely go beyond old age and death. It is said “These teachings go to the beyond,” therefore this presentation of the Teaching is indeed called “The Way to the Beyond”.</p><blockquote class="gatha">
