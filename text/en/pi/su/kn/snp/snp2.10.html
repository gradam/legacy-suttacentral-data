<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc334"></a>Get up and sit!<br>
What need of sleep!<br>
For the sick what rest is there,<br>
pierced by the dart of pain?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc335"></a>Get up and sit!<br>
Train hard for peace.<br>
Let not Māra know<br>
that you are negligent,<br>
deluded and under his control.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc336"></a>Cross beyond this craving—<br>
tied to, desiring which<br>
gods and men remain.<br>
Don’t let this chance pass by:<br>
those who do so grieve,<br>
sending themselves to hell!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc337"></a>From “dust” arises negligence,<br>
from negligence to more:<br>
by diligence and knowledge,<br>
pluck out the dart oneself.</p>
