<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1"></a>Who removes arisen anger<br>
as herbs a serpent’s venom spread;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc2"></a>Who lust pulls up remainderless<br>

as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc3"></a>Who craving dams remainderless<br>
as drying of a river’s fierce and rapid flow;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc4"></a>Who destroys conceit entire<br>
as a great flood a bridge of reeds so frail;<br>

as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc5"></a>Who in rebirths no essence finds<br>
as a seeker of flowers on Udumbara trees;<br>

as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc6"></a>Who keeps no grudges inwardly<br>
but this “being-not being” has gone beyond;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc7"></a>In who do thoughts no longer smoulder,<br>
internally curtailed, remainderless;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc8"></a>Who neither goes too far nor lags behind,<br>
all mind-proliferation gone beyond;<br>

as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc9"></a>Who neither goes too far nor lags behind,<br>
who of the world has Known, “All is not thus”;<br>

<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc14"></a>In whom are no latent tendencies at all—<br>
whose roots of evil completely are expunged;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc15"></a>In whom is no anxiety at all<br>
to cause return to this existence here;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc16"></a>In whom no attachment formed at all<br>
to cause return to all existences;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc17"></a>Who’s left behind five hindrances,<br>
serene then, crossed doubt, lacking inner barbs;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
