<h1>3.8. Dart of Death</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc580"></a>Here’s the life of mortals,<br>
wretched and brief,<br>
its end unknown,<br>
to <i>dukkha</i> joined.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc581"></a>There’s no means that those<br>
who’re born will never die.<br>
Reached decay, then death:<br>
the law for beings all.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc582"></a>As with what’s ripe<br>
there’s always fear of falling,<br>
so for mortals born<br>
there’s always fear of death.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc583"></a>Just as a potter’s vessels<br>
made of clay all end<br>
by being broken, so<br>
death’s the end of life.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc584"></a>The young, those great in age,<br>
the fools, as well the wise<br>
all go under the sway<br>
of death, for death’s their goal.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc585"></a>Those overcome by death,<br>
to another world bound:<br>
father can’t protect his son,<br>
nor relatives their kin.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc586"></a>While relatives are watching,<br>
they weep and they lament;<br>
See mortals one by one,<br>
led as an ox to slaughter.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc587"></a>As the world’s afflicted<br>
by death and by decay,<br>
so the wise grieve not,<br>
knowing world’s nature well.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc588"></a>Their path you do not know<br>
whereby they come, they go,<br>
neither end you see,<br>
useless your lament.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc589"></a>While lamenting,<br>
The confused harm themselves;<br>
If any benefit could be found,<br>
Would not the wise do it to?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc590"></a>Not by weeping and wailing,<br>
Can peace of mind be reached.<br>
It just creates more suffering,<br>
And distresses the body.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc591"></a>You become thin and discolored,<br>
Harming yourself with your self;<br>
And the departed are not protected by this,<br>
Lamentation is pointless!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc592"></a>When grief is not abandoned,<br>
A person falls into even more suffering;<br>
Wailing over the dead,<br>
They are overpowered by grief.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc593"></a>See how others fare,<br>
People passing on according to their deeds;<br>
Creatures tremble,<br>
As they fall under the sway of Death.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc594"></a>Whatever you think it is,<br>
It becomes something else.<br>
Such is separation,<br>
See the way of the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc595"></a>Even if a person were to live<br>
A hundred years or more,<br>
They would still be divided from their family,<br>
Abandoning this life.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc596"></a>That is why having heard the arahant,<br>
And dispelled lamentation;<br>
When you see the dead and departed,<br>
You don’t think you can get them back.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc597"></a>Just as one would extinguish<br>
A burning building with water;<br>
So too a steadfast, wise one, a skilful, clever person,<br>
Would quickly blow away<br>
Grief when it arises,<br>
As wind, a tuft of cotton.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc598"></a>One who is seeking happiness<br>
should draw out the painful dart—<br>
lamentations and longings—<br>
the grief that is within.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc599"></a>Dart withdrawn and unattached,<br>
the mind attains to peace,<br>
passed beyond all grief,<br>
griefless, fires put out.</p>
