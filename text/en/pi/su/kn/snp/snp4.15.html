<h1>4.15. “Assuming Forcefulness” and so on</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc942"></a>Fear’s born assuming forcefulness—<br>
see how the people fight!<br>
I’ll tell you how I’m deeply moved,<br>
how I have felt so stirred.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc943"></a>Seeing how people flounder<br>
as fish in little water<br>
attacking one the other<br>
its fearfulness appeared.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc944"></a>Once I wished a place to stay,<br>
but all the world is essenceless,<br>
turmoil in every quarter,<br>
I saw no place secure.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc945"></a>Folks’ never-ending enmity<br>
I saw, took no delight,<br>
but then I saw the hard-to-see,<br>
the dart within the heart.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc946"></a>Affected by this dart<br>
one runs in all directions<br>
but with the dart pulled out<br>
one neither runs nor sinks.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc947"></a>On this, the training’s chanted thus:<br>
Whatever bonds within the world<br>
they should not be pursued<br>
knowing in depth all sense-desires<br>
for Nirvāṇa train.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc948"></a>Truthful and not arrogant,<br>
deceit none, slander, hate,<br>
rid of greed’s evil, avarice<br>
beyond them all’s the sage.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc949"></a>Not sleepy, drowsy, slothful not,<br>
living not with negligence,<br>
taking no stand on arrogance:<br>
that mind inclines to Nibbana.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc950"></a>Be not into lying led,<br>
for forms have no affection,<br>
know thoroughly conceit,<br>
violence avoid fare thus.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc951"></a>Delight not in the past,<br>
nor be content with newness,<br>
sad not with disappearance,<br>
nor crave for the attractive.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc952"></a>Greed I say’s “the great flood”,<br>
its torrent the rush of lust,<br>
lust’s objects an imagining,<br>
the swamp of lust is hard to cross.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc953"></a>The sage on firm ground stands,<br>
not swayed from truth, a paragon,<br>
having relinquished All,<br>
“peaceful” that one’s called.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc954"></a>The wise indeed, all wisdom won,<br>
on dharma not dependant,<br>
wanders perfected in this world,<br>
and envies none herein.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc955"></a>Who sense-desires has crossed beyond,<br>
undone worldly ties<br>
and bondless, cut across the stream,<br>
no longer grieves or broods.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc956"></a>Let what’s “before” just wither up,<br>
“after” for you be not a thing,<br>
if then “between” you will not grasp,<br>
You will fare at peace.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc957"></a>For whom with mind-and-bodily forms<br>
there is no “making-mine” at all,<br>
grieves not when they are not,<br>
and suffers here no loss.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc958"></a>For whom there is no “this is mine”<br>
nor no “To others it belongs”,<br>
in whom “myself” cannot be found,<br>
Grieves not that “I have none”.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc959"></a>Asked upon one unshakeable,<br>
I tell of this one’s goodness:<br>
Not harsh, not covetous at all,<br>
Steadfast, impartial everywhere.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc960"></a>For one who’s steadfast, Knows,<br>
That one does not accumulate,<br>
Unattached to making effort,<br>
Sees security everywhere.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc961"></a>A sage speaks not as though<br>
’Mong equal, low or high,<br>
Serene, devoid of avarice,<br>
Does not accept or reject.</p>
