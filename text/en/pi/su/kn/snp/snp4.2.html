<h1>4.2 The Eight on the Body as a Cave</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc779"></a>The person who’s to their body-cave<br>
Clouded by many moods, and in delusion sunk,<br>
Hard it is for that one, far from detachment,<br>
To abandon sensual pleasures in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc780"></a>Bound the worldly pleasures of the past,<br>
And hard to liberate are they in future time,<br>
From others they’re not free, not liberated—<br>
They’re attached to past and the future too.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc781"></a>Those who are niggardly, who hank after pleasures,<br>
infatuated they are, all their things—losses all!<br>
But subjected to pain they lament their losses—<br>
For how can all this be taken away, they wail?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc782"></a>Therefore should a person train,<br>
Seeing the roughness of the world,<br>
To take not to a wicked way,<br>
For the wise say, life is short!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc783"></a>I see here trembling, fearful in the world,<br>
These people gone under the sway of craving for births—<br>
Base people floundering in the jaws of death,<br>
Not free from craving for repeated birth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc784"></a>Look at them trembling with their egotistic selfishness,<br>
Like fish in a stream fast drying-up,<br>
Seeing it so, fare unselfish in this life,<br>
And cease worrying on different states of being.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc785"></a>No longer longing towards either extreme<br>
Having understood touch, together with letting go,<br>
One should do what others will praise and not blame,<br>
A wise one is not stained by what is seen and heard.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc786"></a>The sage has known perception and crossed the flood,<br>
So with nothing tainted, nothing wrapped around,<br>
They fare on in diligence with the arrow drawn,<br>
Neither longing for this world nor for another.</p>
