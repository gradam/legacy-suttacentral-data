<h1>4.1. Objects, Desires and Pleasures</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc773"></a>If one with a desiring mind<br>
Succeeds in gaining sensual pleasure,<br>
A mortal such is pleased in mind<br>
With wishes all fulfilled.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc774"></a>But if from this person passionate<br>
all of these pleasures disappear,<br>
then does this pleasure-addict feel,<br>
as though by arrows pierced.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc775"></a>The one who shuns these pleasures of sense,<br>
like treading not on a serpent’s head,<br>
such a one with mindfulness<br>
this tangled world transcends.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc776"></a>Obsessed with fields and property,<br>
with money, estates and those employed,<br>
with many pleasures, women and kin,<br>
such a person greedily—</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc777"></a>Do weaknesses bring down indeed,<br>
by dangers is that person crushed,<br>
and then by <i>dukkhas</i> stuck against—<br>
as water into broken boat.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc778"></a>So let a mindful one avoid<br>
at every turn these sense-desires,<br>
with them abandoned, cross the flood,<br>
as boat is baled for the Further Shore.</p>
