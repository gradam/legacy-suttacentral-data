“I think you have true understanding, and a developed self—<br>
how have these countless kinds of suffering<br>
arisen for whoever is in the world?”</p>

“as I know it I will declare it to you:<br>
Because of clinging to a basis countless kinds<br>
of suffering originate for whoever is in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="snp1058"></a><a class="snp-vagga-verse">5.76</a><a class="verse-num-pts">1051</a><a class="snp-vagga-section-verse">5.5.3</a>“The foolish one, without wisdom, clings to a basis,<br>
and comes to suffering again and again, the fool.<br>
Therefore knowing this, do not cling to a basis,<br>
seeing the birth and origin of suffering.”<br>

“another thing we ask, come on, please answer it:<br>
How do the wise ones cross over the flood<br>
of birth, old age, grief, and lamentation?<br>
Please explain this to me, O sage,<br>
for this Teaching has been understood by you.”</p>

“which is not hearsay in this world,<br>
which, having understood, and living mindfully, one can cross over clinging to the world.”</p>

dispel the enjoyment of, and settling on, these things,<br>
and consciousness, and one will not remain in existence.</p>

the monk who lives on after giving up loved things,<br>
can, being wise, give up birth, old age,<br>
grief, lamentation, and suffering right here.”</p>

“O Gotama, well proclaimed is freedom from clinging.<br>
Surely the Gracious One gave up suffering,<br>
for this Teaching has been understood by you.</p>

whomever you would continually advise, O Sage,<br>
therefore having met the Strong One, I revere him,<br>
perhaps the Gracious One could continuously advise me!”</p>

“who has nothing, and is not clinging to sense existence,<br>
for he has surely crossed over the flood,<br>
without hindrance or doubt, he has crossed beyond.</p>

who has released the shackle of repeated existence,<br>
he is craving-free, not troubled, not yearning—<br>
he has crossed over birth and old age, I say.”</p>
