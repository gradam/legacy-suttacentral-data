<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc338"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
From living together constantly,<br>
the Teacher you don’t scorn?<br>
Torch-bearer to humanity,<br>
is he by you revered?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc339"></a><span class="speaker">Rāhula</span><br>
From living together constantly,<br>
the Teacher I scorn not.<br>
Torch-bearer to humanity<br>
is by me revered.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc340"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
Having let go five sense-desires,<br>
and forms that are dear, delighting mind,<br>
with faith renounce the household life,<br>
be one who <i>dukkha</i> ends.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc341"></a>Keep company with noble friends,<br>
dwell in a lonely practice-place,<br>
secluded, having little noise,<br>
with food be moderate.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc342"></a>Robes as well as food from alms,<br>
with shelter, also remedies—<br>
for these things no craving form,<br>
so turn not to the world again.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc343"></a>By Pāṭimokkha stay restrained<br>
and by the five sense faculties,<br>
practise bodily mindfulness<br>
to be dispassionate.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc344"></a>Avoid those objects beautiful,<br>
which may be linked with lust,<br>
on the unlovely, one-pointed,<br>
well-concentrated, grow the mind.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc345"></a>Develop then the signless state,<br>
with tendency to pride let go—<br>
by fully understanding it,<br>
truly as peaceful you will fare.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>In this way the Radiant One with these verses frequently exhorted the venerable Rāhula.</p>
