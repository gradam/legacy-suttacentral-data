<h1>1.12 The Sage Inwardly Silent</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc209"></a>From familiarity fear is born,<br>
from household life arises dust;<br>
no household, no familiar life—<br>
such is the vision for the sage.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc210"></a>Who, cutting down what has grown up,<br>
plants not again, supplies no means for growth,<br>
they call that Sage who fares alone;<br>
great-seeker-seen-the-place-of-peace.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc211"></a>Who has surveyed the grounds and lost the seeds,<br>
and supplied no means for further growth,<br>
is Sage seen to the end of birth and death,<br>
logic abandoned and beyond reckoning.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc212"></a>Truly have been known all resting-places<br>
with no desires at all for any there—<br>
that sage indeed, free from crowing, greed,<br>
struggles not, gone to the further shore.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc213"></a>Who is intelligent, knowing All, All overcome<br>
among all the dharmas, one who cannot be sullied,<br>
who All has abandoned, freed by craving’s end—<br>
that one do the wise proclaim as a sage.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc214"></a>In wisdom strong, in virtuous conduct established,<br>
in concentration and enjoying <i>jhāna</i>,<br>
free from all ties, aridity and the inﬂows—<br>
that one do the wise proclaim as a sage.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc215"></a>The vigilant sage who practises alone,<br>
who unshaken is by blame or praise,<br>
is as a lion that trembles not at sounds,<br>
or as wind within a net cannot be caught,<br>
or like a lotus flower by water not defiled,<br>
leading other people but not by others led—<br>
that one do the wise proclaim as a sage.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc216"></a>Who though oppressed, is unmoving as a pile-post,<br>
when others about oneself use speech extreme;<br>
that one free from lust, sense-faculties restrained—<br>
that one do the wise proclaim as a sage.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc217"></a>Who is straight-minded as shuttle straightly moves,<br>
and who conduct examines both the rough and the smooth,<br>
and so who turns away from evil karma-making—<br>
that one do the wise proclaim as a sage.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc218"></a>Who with a mind restrained, evil does not do,<br>
whether young, middle-aged or sage self-controlled,<br>
who cannot be provoked nor others does provoke—<br>
that one do the wise proclaim as a sage.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc219"></a>Who lives upon almsfood by others donated,<br>
receiving the first, the middle, or remainders at the end,<br>
who then sings not owned praises, or hurtfully speak—<br>
that one do the wise proclaim as a sage.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc220"></a>The sage not practising indulgence in sex,<br>
who even when youthful was not tied to anyone,<br>
not indulgence in madness of wanton ways but free—<br>
that one do the wise proclaim as a sage.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc221"></a>True Knower of the universe, Seer of highest truth,<br>
crossed the ocean’s flood, One Thus and unattached,<br>
One who’s knots are cut, with no inﬂows left—<br>
that one do the wise proclaim as a sage.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc222"></a>The householder with wife, and the “not-mine-maker”<br>
of strict practices—their living-ways not the same:<br>
house-livers not restrained from taking others’ lives,<br>
but the sage always guards other beings’ lives.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc223"></a>In flight the crested peacock, turquoise-necked,<br>
never the swiftness of the swan attains,<br>
so a house-liver cannot match a bhikkhu,<br>
a sage meditating in the woods.</p>
