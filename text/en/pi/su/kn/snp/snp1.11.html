<h1>1.11. Victory Over Fascination with Bodies</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc195"></a>Whether walking or standing still,<br>
down one sits or lays it down,<br>
bends it in or stretches it—<br>
it’s just the body’s movement.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc196"></a>This body by bones and sinews bound,<br>
bedaubed by membranes, flesh<br>
and covered all over by skin—<br>
not seen as it really is:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc197"></a>Filled with guts, with stomach filled,<br>
with bladder, liver-lump<br>
with heart and lungs it’s filled,<br>
with kidneys too and spleen.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc198"></a>Liquids like spittle and snot<br>
together with sweat and fat,<br>
with blood and oil for the joints,<br>
with bile and grease for the skin.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc199"></a>Then by the streaming nine<br>
impurity oozes out:<br>
from the eye there’s dirt of eyes,<br>
from ears, wax—dirt of ears,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc200"></a>Whether walking or standing still,<br>
down one sits or lays it down,<br>
bends it in or stretches it—<br>
it’s just the body’s movement.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc201"></a>Snot-mucuses from nose,<br>
vomit at times from the mouth,<br>
sometimes phlegm’s spewed forth,<br>
and from the body sweat and dirt.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc202"></a>And then within its hollow head<br>
bundled brains are stuffed—<br>
the fool thinks all is beautiful,<br>
by ignorance led on.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc203"></a>But when it’s lying dead,<br>
bloated and livid blue,<br>
cast away in the charnel-ground<br>
kin care for it not.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc204"></a>Then dogs devour, jackals too,<br>
wolves and worms dismember it,<br>
crows and vultures tear at it,<br>
and other creatures too.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc205"></a>Contemplate: this living body,<br>
that corpse was once like this<br>
and as that corpse is now<br>
so will this body be—<br>
for body then discard desire,<br>
whether within or without.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc206"></a>Such a monk who’s wise, desire<br>
and lust discarded utterly,<br>
attains to Deathlessness, to peace,<br>
Nirvāṇa, the unchanging state.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc207"></a>But this foetid, foul, two-footed thing,<br>
is pampered, though filled<br>
with varied sorts of stench, as well<br>
with oozing here and there.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc208"></a>Whoever such a body has,<br>
but thinks to exalt themselves,<br>
or to despise another—<br>
what’s this but wisdom’s lack?</p>
