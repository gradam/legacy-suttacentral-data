<h1>7.6.5 The Owl</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, those two qualities of the owl you say he ought to take, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the owl, being at enmity with the crows, goes at night where the flocks of crows are, and kills numbers of them; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en345"></a> at enmity with ignorance; seated alone and in secret, he should crush it out of existence, cut it off at the root. This, O king, is the first quality of the owl he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15"></a>‘And again, O king, as the owl is a solitary bird; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be devoted to solitude, take delight in solitude. This, O king, is the second quality of the owl he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the most excellent Saṃyutta Nikāya:</p>
<p>“Let the Bhikshu, my brethren, be devoted to solitude, take delight in solitude, to the end that he may realise what sorrow really is, and what the origin of sorrow really is, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi404"></a> and what the cessation of sorrow really is, and what the path that leads to the cessation of sorrow really is.”’</p>
