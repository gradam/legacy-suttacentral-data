<h1>3.1.10 Faith</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10"></a>The king said, ‘Venerable Nāgasena, what is the characteristic mark of faith?’</p>
<p>‘Tranquillisation, O king, and aspiration.’</p>
<p>‘And how is tranquillisation the mark of faith?’</p>
<p>As faith, O king, springs up in the heart it breaks through the five hindrances—lust, malice, mental sloth, spiritual pride, and doubt—and the heart, free from these hindrances, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi35"></a> becomes clear, serene, untroubled.’</p>
<p>‘Give me an illustration.’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as a suzerain king, when on the march with his fourfold army, might cross over a small stream, and the water, disturbed by the elephants and cavalry, the chariots and the bowmen, might become fouled, turbid, and muddy. And <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en55"></a> when he was on the other side the monarch might give command to his attendants, saying: “Bring some water, my good men. I would fain drink.” Now suppose the monarch had a water-clearing gem, and those men, in obedience to the order, were to throw the jewel into the water; then at once all the mud would precipitate itself, and the sandy atoms of shell and bits of water-plants would disappear, and the water would become clear, transparent, and serene, and they would then bring some of it to the monarch to drink. The water is the heart; the royal servants are the recluse; the mud, the sandy atoms, and the bits of water-plants are evil dispositions; and the water-cleansing gem is faith.’</p>
