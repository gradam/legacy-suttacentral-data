<h1>3.5.5.  Rebirth and transmigration</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5"></a>The king said: ‘Where there is no transmigration, Nāgasena, can there be rebirth?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, there can.’</p>
<p>‘But how can that be? Give me an illustration.’</p>
<p>‘Suppose a man, O king, were to light a lamp from another lamp, can it be said that the one transmigrates from, or to, the other?’</p>
<p>‘Certainly not.’</p>
<p>‘Just so, great king, is rebirth without transmigration.’</p>
<p>‘Give me a further illustration.’</p>
<p>‘Do you recollect, great king, having learnt, when you were a boy, some verse or other from your teacher?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, I recollect that.’</p>
<p>‘Well then, did that verse transmigrate from your teacher?’</p>
<p>‘Certainly not.’</p>
<p>‘Just so, great king, is rebirth without transmigration.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
