<h1>3.1.3 (Interlude) How kings and scholars respectively discuss</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs3"></a>The king said: ‘Reverend Sir, will you discuss with me again?’</p>
<p>‘If your Majesty will discuss as a scholar (paṇḍit), well; but if you will discuss as a king, no.’</p>
<p>‘How is it then that scholars discuss?’</p>
<p>‘When scholars talk a matter over one with another then is there a winding up, an unravelling; one or other is convicted of error, and he then acknowledges his mistake; <a class="pts-vp-pi29"></a> distinctions are drawn, and contra-distinctions ; and yet thereby they are not angered. Thus do scholars, O king, discuss.’</p>
<p>‘And how do kings discuss?’</p>
<p>‘When a king, your Majesty, discusses a matter, and he advances a point, if any one differ from him on that point, he is apt to fine him, saying: “Inflict such and such a punishment upon that fellow!” Thus, your Majesty, do kings discuss.’</p>
<p>‘Very well. It is as a scholar, not as a king, that I will discuss. Let your reverence talk unrestrainedly, as you would with a brother, or a novice, or a lay disciple, or even with a servant. Be not afraid!’ <a class="pts-vp-en47"></a></p>
<p>‘Very good, your Majesty,’ said Nāgasena, with thankfulness.</p>
<p>‘Nāgasena, I have a question to ask you;’ said the king.</p>
<p>‘Pray ask it, Sire.’</p>
<p>‘I have asked it, your Reverence.’</p>
<p>‘That is answered already.’</p>
<p>‘What have you answered?’</p>
<p>‘To what, then, does your Majesty refer?’</p>
<p>But Milinda the king thought: ‘This Bhikkhu is a great scholar. He is quite capable of discussing things with me. And I shall have a number of points on which to question him, and before I can ask them all, the sun will set. It would be better to carry on the discussion at home to-morrow.’ And he said to Devamantiya: ‘You may let his reverence know that the discussion with the king shall be resumed to-morrow at the palace.’ And so saying, he took leave of Nāgasena, and mounted his horse, and went away, muttering as he went, ‘Nāgasena, Nāgasena!’</p>
<p>And Devamantiya delivered his message to Nāgasena, who accepted the proposal with gladness. And early the next morning Devamantiya and Anantakāya and Mankura and Sabbadinna. went to the king, and said: ‘Is his reverence, Nāgasena, to come, <a class="pts-vp-pi30"></a> Sire, to-day?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, he is to come.’</p>
<p>‘With how many of the brethren is he to come?’</p>
<p>‘With as many as he likes.’</p>
<p>And Sabbadinna said: ‘Let him come with ten.’ But the king repeated what he had said.. And on Sabbadinna reiterating his suggestion, the ‘king rejoined: ‘All this preparation has been made, and I say: <a class="pts-vp-en48"></a> “Let him come with as many as he likes,” yet Sabbadinna says: “Let him come with ten.” Does he suppose we are not capable of feeding so many?’</p>
<p>Then Sabbadinna was ashamed.</p>
