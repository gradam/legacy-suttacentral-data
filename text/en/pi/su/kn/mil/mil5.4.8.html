<h1>5.4.8 Women’s Wiles</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en294"></a><a class="pts-cs42"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, it has been said by the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“With opportunity, and secrecy,<br>
And the right woo’r, all women will go wrong—<br>
Aye, failing others, with a cripple even.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But on the other hand it is said: “Mahosadha’s wife, Amarā, when left behind in the village while her husband was away on a journey, remained alone and in privacy, and regarding her husband as a man would regard his sovran lord, she refused to do wrong, even when tempted with a thousand pieces.” Now if the first of these passages be correct, the second must be wrong; and if the second be right, <a class="pts-vp-pi206"></a>The first must be wrong. This too is a double-edged problem now put to you, and you have to solve it.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs43"></a>‘It is so said, O king, as you have quoted, touching the conduct of Amarā, Mahosadha’s wife. But the question is would she have done wrong, on receipt of those thousand pieces, with the right man: or would she not have done so, if she had had the opportunity, and the certainty of secrecy, and a suitable wooer? Now, on considering the matter, that lady Amarā was not certain of any of these <a class="pts-vp-en295"></a> things. Through her fear of censure in this world the opportunity seemed to her not fit, and through her fear of the sufferings of purgatory in the next world. And because she knew how bitter is the fruit of wrong-doing, and because she did not wish to lose her loved one, and because of the high esteem in which she held her husband, and because she honoured goodness, and despised ignobleness of life, and because she did not want to break with her customary mode of life—for all these reasons the opportunity seemed to her not fit.</p>
<p>‘And, further, she refused to do wrong because, on consideration, she was not sure of keeping the thing secret from the world. <a class="pts-vp-pi207"></a> For even could she have kept it secret from men, yet she could not have concealed it from spirits —even could she have kept it secret from spirits, yet she could not have concealed it from those recluses who have the power of knowing the thoughts of others-even could she have kept it secret from them, yet she could not have concealed it from those of the gods who can read the hearts of men—even could she have kept it secret from the gods, yet she could not have escaped, herself, from the knowledge of her sin—even could she have remained ignorant of it herself, yet she could not have kept it secret from (the law of the result which follows on) unrighteousness. Such were the <a class="pts-vp-en296"></a> various reasons which led her to abstain from doing wrong because she could not be sure of secrecy.</p>
<p>‘And, further, she refused to do wrong because, on consideration, she found no right wooer. Mahosadha the wise, O king, was endowed with the eight and twenty qualities. And which are those twenty-eight? He was brave, O king, and full of modesty, and ashamed to do wrong, he had many adherents, and many friends, he was forgiving, he was upright in life, he was truthful, he was pure in word, and deed and heart, he was free from malice, he was not puffed up, he felt no jealousy, he was full of energy, he strove after all good things, he was popular with all men, he was generous, he was friendly, he was humble in disposition, he was free from guile, he was free from deceit, he was full of insight, he was of high reputation, he had much knowledge, he sought after the good of those dependent on him, his praise was in all men’s mouths, great was his wealth, and great his fame. Such were the twenty-eight qualities, O king, with which ‘Mahosadha, the wise, was endowed. And it was because she found no wooer like unto him that she did no wrong.’ <a class="pts-vp-en297"></a></p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.’</p>
<p class="endsection">Here ends the dilemma as to the wickedness of women.</p>
