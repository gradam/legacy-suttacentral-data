<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs43"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, the three qualities of Sakka (the king of the gods) which you say he ought to take, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as Sakka enjoys perfect bliss; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, rejoice in the perfect bliss of retirement. This, O king, is the first quality of Sakka he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs44"></a>‘And again, O king, as when Sakka when he sees his gods around him keeps them in his favour, fills them with joy; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, keep his mind detached, alert, and tranquil, should make joy spring up within him, should rouse himself, exert himself, be full of zeal. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi391"></a> This, O king is the second quality of Sakka he ought to have. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en323"></a></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs45"></a>‘And again, O king, as Sakka feels no discontent; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never allow himself to become discontented with solitude. This, O king, is the third quality of Sakka he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Subhūti, the Elder:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Since I, great hero, have renounced the world,<br>
According to the doctrine that you teach,<br>
I will not grant that any thought of lust<br>
Or craving care has risen in my breast.”’</p>
