<h1>3.1.2 The riddle of seniority</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs2"></a>‘How many years seniority have you, Nāgasena?’</p>
<p>‘Seven, your Majesty.’</p>
<p>‘But how can you say it is your “seven?” Is it you who are “seven,” or the number that is “seven?”’</p>
<p>Now that moment the figure of the king, decked in all the finery of his royal ornaments, cast its shadow on the ground, and was reflected in a vessel of water. And Nāgasena asked him: ‘Your figure, O king, is now shadowed upon the ground, and reflected in the water, how now, are you the king, or is the reflection the king?’</p>
<p>‘I am the king, Nāgasena, but the shadow comes into existence because of me.’</p>
<p>‘Just even so, O king, the number of the years is seven, I am not seven. But it is because of me, O king, that the number seven has come into existence; and it is mine in the same sense as the shadow is yours.’ <a class="pts-vp-en46"></a></p>
<p>‘Most wonderful again, and strange, Nāgasena. Well has the question put to you, most difficult though it was, been solved!’</p>
