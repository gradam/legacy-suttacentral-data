<h1>3.6.4 Pure conduct</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs4"></a>The king said: ‘Was the Buddha, Nāgasena, pure in conduct (was he a Brahma-cārin)?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, the Blessed One was pure.’</p>
<p>‘Then, Nāgasena, it follows that he was a follower of Brahmā.’ <a class="pts-vp-en118"></a></p>
<p>‘Have you a state elephant, O king?’</p>
<p>‘Certainly.’ <a class="pts-vp-pi76"></a></p>
<p>‘Well now, does that elephant ever trumpet (literally “cry the heron’s cry “)?’</p>
<p>‘Oh, yes.’</p>
<p>‘But is he, then, on that account a follower of the herons?’</p>
<p>‘Of course not.’</p>
<p>‘Now tell me, great king, has Brahma wisdom (Buddhi), or has he not?’</p>
<p>‘He is a being with wisdom.’</p>
<p>‘Then (on your argument) he is surely a follower of Buddha.’</p>
<p>‘Well answered, Nāgasena!’</p>
