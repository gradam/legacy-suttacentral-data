<h1>5.4.2 On Secret Doctrine</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en264"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi190"></a> ‘Venerable Nāgasena, it was said by the Blessed One: “The Dhamma and the Vinaya (Doctrine and Canon Law) proclaimed by the Tathāgata shine forth when they are displayed, and not when they are concealed.” But on the other hand the recitation of the Pātimokkha and the whole of the Vinaya Piṭaka are closed and kept secret. So that if, Nāgasena, you (members of the Order) carried out what is just, and right, and held of faith in the teaching of the Conqueror then would the Vinaya shine forth as an open thing. And why would that be so? Because all the instruction therein, the discipline, the self-control, the regulations as to moral and virtuous conduct, are in their essence full of truth and righteousness, and redounding to emancipation of heart. But if the Blessed One really said that the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata shine forth when displayed and not when kept secret, then the saying that the recitation of the Pātimokkha and the whole of the Vinaya must be kept secret must be wrong. And if that be right, then the saying of the Blessed One must be wrong. This too is a double-edged problem now put to you, and you have to solve it.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5"></a>‘It was said, O king, by the Blessed One that the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en265"></a> shine forth when displayed, and not when kept secret. And on the other hand the recitation of the Pātimokkha and the whole of the Vinaya Piṭaka are kept close and secret. But this last is not the case as regards all men. They are only kept secret up to a certain limit. And the recitation of the Pātimokkha is kept secret up to that certain limit on three grounds—firstly because that is the traditional custom of previous Tathāgatas, secondly out of respect for the Truth (Dhamma), and thirdly out of respect for the position of a member of the Order.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6"></a>‘And as to the first it was the universal custom, O king, of previous Tathāgatas for the recitation of the Pātimokkha to take place in the midst of the members of the Order only, to the exclusion of all others. Just, O king, as the Kshatriya secret formulas (of the nobles) are handed down among the nobles alone, and that this or that is so is common tradition among the nobles of the world and kept secret from all others—<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi191"></a> so was this the universal custom of previous Tathāgatas, that the recitation of the Pātimokkha should take place among the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en266"></a> members of the Order only, and be kept secret from all others. And again, just as there are several classes of people, O king, known as distinct in the world—-such as wrestlers, tumblers, jugglers, actors, ballet-dancers, and followers of the mystic cult of the sun and moon, of the goddess of fortune and other gods. And the secrets of each of these sects are handed on in the sect itself, and kept hidden from all others. just so with the universal custom of all the Tathāgatas that the recitation of the Pātimokkha should take place before the members of the Order only, and be kept secret from all others. This is why the recitation of the Pātimokkha is, up to that extent, kept secret in accordance with the habit of previous Tathāgatas.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7"></a>‘And how is it that the Pātimokkha is kept secret, up to that extent, out of reverence for the Dhamma? the Dhamma, great king, is venerable and weighty. He who has attained to proficiency in it may exhort another in this wise: “Let not this Dhamma so full of truth, so excellent, fall into the hands of those unversed in it, where it would be despised and contemned, treated shamefully, made a game of, and found fault with. Nor let it fall into the hands of the wicked who would deal with it in all respects as badly as they.” It is thus, O king, that the recitation of the Pātimokkha is, up to that <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en267"></a> extent, kept secret out of reverence for the Dhamma. For if not, then it would be like the best, most costly, and most rare red sandal wood of the finest kind, which when brought to Savara (that city of the outcast Kaṇḍālas) is despised and contemned, treated shamefully, made game of, and found fault with.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi192"></a> ‘And how is it that the Pātimokkha is kept secret, up to that extent, out of reverence for the position of a member of the Order? the condition of a Bhikkhu, great king, is in glory beyond the reach of calculation by weight, or measure, or price. None can value it, weigh it, measure it. And the recitation of the Pātimokkha, is carried on before the Bhikkhus alone, lest any one who has occupied that position should be brought down to a level with the men of the world. just, O king, as if there be any priceless thing, in vesture or floor covering, in elephants, chargers, or chariots, in gold or silver or jewels or pearls or women, or in unsurpassable strong drink, all such things are the appanage of kings—just so, O king, whatever is most priceless in the way of training, of the traditions of the Blessed One, of learning, of conduct, and of the virtues of righteousness and self-control—all these are the appanages of the Order of Bhikkhus. This is why the recitation of the Pātimokkha is, to that extent, kept secret.’ <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en268"></a></p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.)</p>
