<h1>3.1.7.  Wisdom and reasoning distinguished</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7"></a>The king said: ‘Nāgasena, he who escapes reindividualisation is it by reasoning that he escapes it?’</p>
<p>‘Both by reasoning, your Majesty, and by wisdom, and by other good qualities.’</p>
<p>‘But are not reasoning and wisdom surely much the same?’</p>
<p>‘Certainly not. Reasoning is one thing, wisdom <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en51"></a> another. Sheep and goats, oxen and buffaloes, camels and asses have reasoning, but wisdom they have not.’</p>
<p>‘Well put, Nāgasena!’</p>
