<h1>7.7.9 The Fisherman</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs24"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, those two qualities of the fisherman you say he ought to take, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the fisherman draws up the fish on his hook; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, draw up by his knowledge, and that to the uttermost, the fruits of Samanaship. This, O king, is the first quality of the fisherman he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs25"></a>‘And again, O king, just as the fisherman by the sacrifice of a very little comes to great gain ; just so, O king, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi413"></a> should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, renounce the mean baits of worldly things; then by that renunciation will he gain the mighty fruits of Samanaship. This, O king, is the second quality of the fisherman he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Rāhula, the Elder:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Renouncing the baits of the world he shall gain<br>
The state that is void of lust, anger, and sin—<br>
Those conditions of sentient life—and be free,<br>
Free from the cravings that mortals feel,<br>
And the fruits of the stages of th’ Excellent Way<br>
And the six modes of Insight shall all be his.”’</p>
