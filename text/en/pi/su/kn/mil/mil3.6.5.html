<h1>3.6.5 Ordination</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5"></a>The king said: ‘Is ordination a good thing?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, a good thing and a beautiful.’</p>
<p>‘But did the Buddha obtain it, or not?’</p>
<p>‘Great king, when the Blessed One attained omniscience at the foot of the tree of Knowledge, that was to him an ordination. There was no conferring of ordination upon him at the hands of others—in the way that the Blessed One laid down regulations for his disciples, never to be transgressed by them their lives long!’</p>
<p>‘Very true, Nāgasena!’ <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en119"></a></p>
