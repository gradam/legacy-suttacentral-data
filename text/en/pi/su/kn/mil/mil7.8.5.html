<p>‘Just, O king, as vermin are not produced in medicine; just so, O king, should no evil dispositions be allowed to arise in the mind of the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort. This, O king, is the first of the qualities of medicine he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11"></a>‘And again, O king, just as medicine is an antidote to whatever poison may have been imparted by bites or contact, by eating or by drinking in any way; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, counteract in himself the poison of lusts, and malice, and dullness, and pride, and wrong belief, This, O king, is the second of the qualities of medicine he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all the gods:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“The strenuous recluse who longs to see<br>
Into the nature, and the meaning true,<br>
Of the constituent elements of things,<br>
Must as it were an antidote become,<br>
To the destruction of all evil thoughts.”’</p>
