<h1>3.4.7 The world rests on water</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5"></a>The king said: ‘Venerable Nāgasena, your people say that the world rests on water, the water on air, the air on space. This saying also I cannot believe.’</p>
<p>Then the Elder brought water in a regulation water-pot, and convinced king Milinda, saying: ‘As this water is supported by the atmosphere, so is that water supported by air.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
