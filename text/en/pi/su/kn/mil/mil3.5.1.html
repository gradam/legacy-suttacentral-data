<h1>3.5.1.  Seeing the Buddha</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1"></a>The king said: ‘Have you, Nāgasena, seen the Buddha?’</p>
<p>‘No, Sire.’</p>
<p>‘Then have your teachers seen the Buddha?’</p>
<p>‘No, Sire.’</p>
<p>‘Then, venerable Nāgasena, there is no Buddha!’</p>
<p>‘But, great king, have you seen the river ūhā in the Himālaya mountains?’</p>
<p>‘No, Sir.’</p>
<p>‘Or has your father seen it?’</p>
<p>‘No, Sir.’</p>
<p>‘Then, your Majesty, is there therefore no such river?’</p>
<p>‘It is there. Though neither I nor my father has seen it, it is nevertheless there.’</p>
<p>‘Just so, great king, though neither I nor my teachers have seen the Blessed One, nevertheless there was such a person.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
