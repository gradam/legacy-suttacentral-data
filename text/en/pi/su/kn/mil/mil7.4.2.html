<h1>7.4.2 Water</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs6"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, the five qualities of water which you say he ought to take, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as water is firmly fixed (in pools, wells, &amp;c.), shakes not, and (in its ordinary state) is not disturbed, and is pure by nature; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, putting away hypocrisy, and whining, and intimating their wants, and improper influences of all sorts, be fixed, unshaken, undisturbed, and pure in nature. This, O king, is the first quality of water he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs7"></a>‘And again, O king, as water is always of a refreshing nature; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be full of pity, and love, and kindness to all beings, seeking the good of all, in mercy to all. This, O king, is the second quality of water he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs8"></a>‘And again, O king, as water makes the dirty clean; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, <a class="pts-vp-en310"></a> earnest in effort, be in all places, whether in the village or in the forest, free from disputes with, free from offence against his teachers, his masters, or those standing towards him like a teacher. This, O king, is the third quality of water he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs9"></a>‘And again, O king, as water is desired of all men; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, wishing for little, content, given to solitude and retirement, be always an object of desire to all the world. This, O king, is the fourth quality of water he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs10"></a>‘And again, O king, as water works no harm to any man; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never do any wrong, whether in deed or word or thought, which would produce in others either strife, or quarrel, or contention, or dispute, or a feeling of emptiness, or anger, or discontent. <a class="pts-vp-pi384"></a> This, O king, is the fifth quality of water he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the Kaṇha Jātaka:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“If you would grant a boon to me,<br>
O Sakka, lord of every creature—<br>
Let none, Sakka, on my account,<br>
Be harmed, whether in mind or body,<br>
At any time or place. This, Sakka,<br>
This would I choose as boon of boons.”’</p>
