<h1>5.3.10.  The Buddha’s Exultation</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en253"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs33"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, the Blessed One said: “If, O Bhikkhus, any one should speak in praise of me, or of our religion (Dhamma), or of the Order, you should not thereupon indulge in joy, or delight, or exultation of mind “. And on the other hand the Tathāgata was so delighted, and pleased, and exultant at the deserved praise bestowed on him by Sela the Brahman, that he still further magnified his own goodness in that he said:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“A king am I, Sela, the king supreme<br>
Of righteousness. The royal chariot wheel<br>
In righteousness do I set rolling on—<br>
That wheel that no one can turn back again!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now if the passage first quoted be right then must the second be wrong, but if that be right then must the first be wrong. This too is a double-edged problem now put to you, and you have to solve it.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs34"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi184"></a> ‘Both your quotations, O king, are correct. But the first passage was spoken by the Blessed One with the intention of setting forth truthfully, exactly, in accordance with reality, and fact, and <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en254"></a> sense, the real nature, and essence, and characteristic marks of the Dhamma. And the second passage was not spoken for the sake of gain or fame, nor out of party spirit, nor in the lust of winning over men to become his followers. But it was in mercy and love, and with the welfare of others in view, conscious that thereby three hundred young Brahmans would attain to the knowledge of the truth, that he said: “A king am I, Sela, the king supreme of righteousness.”’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.’</p>
<p class="endsection">Here ends the problem as to exultation of mind.</p>
