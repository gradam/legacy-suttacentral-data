<h1>7.4.4 Wind</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, those five qualities of wind which you say he ought to take, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as wind pervades the spaces in the woods and groves in flowering time; so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, rejoice in the groves of meditation that are all in blossom with the sweet flowers of emancipation. This, O king, is the first quality of wind he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17"></a>‘And again, O king, as wind sets all the trees that grow upon the earth in agitation, bends them <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en313"></a> down; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, retiring into the midst of the woods, there examining into the true nature of all existing things (all phenomena, Saṃkhāras), beat down all evil dispositions. This, O king, is the second quality of wind he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18"></a>‘And again, O king, as the wind wanders through the sky; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, accustom his mind to wander among transcendental things. This is the third quality of wind he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19"></a>‘And again, O king, as wind carries perfume along; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, carry along with him alway the fragrant perfume of his own righteousness of life. This, O king, is the fourth quality of wind he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20"></a>‘And again, O king, as wind has no house, no home to dwell in; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, remain alway without a house, without a home to dwell in, not addicted to society, set free in mind. This, O king, is the fifth quality of wind he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the Sutta Nipāta:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“In friendship of the world anxiety is born,<br>
In household life distraction’s dust lies thick;<br>
The state set free from home and friendship’s ties—<br>
That, and that only, is the recluse’s aim.”’</p>
