<h1>3.6.10 Memory</h1>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10"></a>The king said: ‘By what, Nāgasena, does one recollect what is past and done long ago?’</p>
<p>‘By memory.’</p>
<p>‘But is it not by the mind, not by the memory, that we recollect?’</p>
<p>‘Do you recollect any business, O king, that you have done and then forgotten?’</p>
<p>‘Yes.’</p>
<p>‘What then? Were you then without a mind?’ <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en121"></a></p>
<p>‘No. But my memory failed me.’</p>
<p>‘Then why do you say that it is by the mind, not by the memory, that we recollect?’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena ’</p>
