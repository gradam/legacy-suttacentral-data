<h1>3.5.10 Is the Buddha real?</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs10"></a>The king said: ‘Is there such a person as the Buddha, Nāgasena?’</p>
<p>‘Yes.’</p>
<p>‘Can he then, Nāgasena, be pointed out as being here or there?’</p>
<p>‘The Blessed One, O king, has passed away by that kind of passing away in which nothing remains which could tend to the formation of another <a class="pts-vp-en114"></a> individual. It is not possible to point out the Blessed One as being here or there.’</p>
<p>‘Give me an illustration.’</p>
<p>‘Now what do you think, O king? When there is a great body of fire blazing, is it possible to point out any one flame that has gone out, that it is here or there?’</p>
<p>‘No, Sir. That flame has ceased, it has vanished.’</p>
<p>‘Just so, great king, has the Blessed One passed away by that kind of passing away in which no root remains for the formation of another individual. The Blessed One has come to an end, and it cannot be pointed out of him, that he is here or there. But in the body of his doctrine he can, O king, be pointed out. For the doctrine was preached by the Blessed One?’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
