<h1>7.6.10.  The Rock-Snake</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs23"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, that one quality of the rock-snake that you say he ought to take, which is it?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the rock-snake, immense as is its length of body, will go many days with empty belly, and, wretched get no food to fill its stomach, yet in spite of that it will just manage to keep itself alive; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, though he be addicted to obtaining his food by alms, dependent on the gifts that others may give, awaiting offers, abstaining from taking anything himself, and find it difficult to get his belly’s-full, yet should he, if he seek after the highest good, even though he receive not so much as four or five mouthfuls to eat, fill up the void by water. This, O king, is the quality of the rock-snake he ought to have. For it was said, O king, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi407"></a> by Sāriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith: <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en350"></a></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Whether it be dry food or wet he eats,<br>
Let him to full repletion never eat.<br>
The good recluse goes forth in emptiness,<br>
And keeps to moderation in his food.<br>
If but four mouthfuls or but five he get,<br>
Let him drink water. For what cares the man<br>
With mind on Arahatship fixed for ease!”’</p>
