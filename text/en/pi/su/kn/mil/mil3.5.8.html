<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8"></a>The king said: ‘When deeds are committed, Nāgasena, by one name-and-form, what becomes of those deeds?’</p>
<p>‘The deeds would follow it, O king, like a shadow that never leaves it.’</p>
<p>‘Can any one point out those deeds, saying: “Here are those deeds, or there”?’</p>
<p>‘No.’ <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en113"></a></p>
<p>‘Give me an illustration.’</p>
<p>‘Now what do you think, O king? Can any one point out the fruits which a tree has not yet produced, saying: “Here they are, or there”?’</p>
<p>‘Certainly not, Sir.’</p>
<p>‘Just so, great king, so long as the continuity of life is not cut off, it is impossible to point out the deeds that are done.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
