<h1>7.4.10 The Sovran Overlord</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs46"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, the four qualities of the sovran overlord which you say he ought to take, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the sovran overlord gains the favour of the people by the four elements of popularity (liberality, affability, justice, and impartiality); just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, find favour with, please, and gladden the hearts of the brethren and rulers of the Order and the laity of either sex. This, O king, is the quality of the sovran overlord he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs47"></a>‘And again, O king, as the sovran overlord allows no robber bands to form in his realm; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never allow lustful or angry or cruel ideas to arise within him. This, O king, is the second quality of the sovran overlord he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods: <a class="pts-vp-en324"></a></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“The man who takes delight in the suppression<br>
Of evil thoughts, and alway self-possessed,<br>
Reflects on the impurity of things<br>
The world thinks beautiful, he will remove—<br>
Nay, cleave in twain, the bonds of the Evil One.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-cs48"></a>‘And again, O king, as the sovran overlord travels through the whole world even to its ocean boundary, examining into the evil and the good; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, examine himself day by day as to his acts and words and thoughts, saying to himself: “How may I pass the day blameless in these three directions?” This, O king, <a class="pts-vp-pi392"></a> is the third quality of the sovran overlord he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the most excellent Ekuttara Nikāya:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“With constant care should the recluse<br>
Himself examine day by day—<br>
’As days and nights pass quickly by<br>
How have they found me? and how left ?’” <a class="pts-vp-en325"></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-cs49"></a>‘And again, O king, as the sovran overlord is completely provided with protection, both within and without; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, keep self-possession as his door-keeper for a protection against all evil, subjective and objective. This, O king, is the fourth quality of the sovran overlord he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods:</p>
<p>“With self-possession as his door-keeper, O brethren, the disciple of the noble ones puts away evil and devotes himself to goodness, puts away what is matter of offence and devotes himself to blamelessness, preserves himself in purity of life.”’</p>
