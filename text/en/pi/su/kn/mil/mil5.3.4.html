<h1>5.3.4.  The Foolish Fellow</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi170"></a> ‘Venerable Nāgasena, it was said by the Elder Sāriputta, the commander of the faith: “The <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en238"></a> Tathāgata, brethren, is perfect in courtesy of speech. There is no fault of speech in the Tathāgata concerning which he should have to take care that no one else should know it.” And on the other hand the Tathāgata, when promulgating the first Pārājika on the occasion of the offence of Sudinna the Kalanda, addressed him with harsh words, calling him a useless fellow. And that Elder, on being so called, terrified with the fear of his teacher, and overcome with remorse, was unable to comprehend the Excellent Way. Now if the first statement be correct, the allegation that the Tathāgata called Sudinna the Kalanda a useless fellow must be false. But if that be true, then the first statement must be false. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi171"></a> This too is a double-pointed problem now put to you, and you have to solve it.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16"></a>‘What Sāriputta the Elder said is true, O king. And the Blessed One called Sudinna a useless fellow on that occasion. But that was not out of rudeness of disposition, it was merely pointing out the real nature (of his conduct) in a way that would do him no harm. And what herein is meant by <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en239"></a> “pointing out the real nature.” If any man, O king, in this birth does not attain to the perception of the Four Truths, then is his manhood (his being born as a man) in vain, but if he acts differently he will become different. Therefore is it that he is called a useless fellow. And so the Blessed One addressed Sudinna the Kalanda with words of truth, and not with words apart from the facts.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17"></a>‘But, Nāgasena, though a man in abusing another speaks the truth, still we should inflict a small fine upon him. For he is guilty of an offence, inasmuch as he, although for something real, abused him by the use of words that might lead to a breach (of the peace).’</p>
<p>‘Have you ever heard, O king, of a people bowing down before, or rising up from their seats in respect for, or showing honour to, or bringing the complimentary presents (usually given to officials) to a criminal?’</p>
<p>‘No, if a man have committed a crime of whatever sort or kind, if he be really worthy of reproof and punishment, they would rather behead him, or torture <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en240"></a> him, or bind him with bonds, or put him to death, or deprive him of his goods.’</p>
<p>‘Did then the Blessed One, O king, act with justice or not?’</p>
<p>‘With justice, Sir, and in a most fit and proper way. And when, Nāgasena, they hear of it the world of men and gods will be made tender of conscience, and afraid of falling into sin, struck with awe at the sight of it, and still more so when they themselves associate with wrong-doers, or do wrong.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi172"></a> ‘Now would a physician, O king, administer pleasant things as a medicine in a case where all the humours of the body were affected, and the whole frame was disorganised and full of disease?’</p>
<p>‘No. Wishing to put an end to the disease he would give sharp and scarifying drugs.’</p>
<p>‘In the same way, O king, the Tathāgata bestows admonition for the sake of suppressing all the diseases of sin. And the words of the Tathāgata, even when stern, soften men and make them tender. Just as hot water, O king, softens and makes tender anything capable of being softened, so are the words of the Tathāgata, even when stern, yet as full of benefit, and as full of pity as the words of a father would be to his children. Just, O king, as the drinking of evil-smelling decoctions, the swallowing of nasty drugs, destroys the weaknesses of men’s bodies, so are the words of the Tathāgata even when stern, bringers of advantage and laden with pity. And <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en241"></a> just, O king, as a ball of cotton falling on a man raises no bruise, so do the words of the Tathāgata, even when stern, do no harm.’</p>
<p>‘Well have you made this problem clear by many a simile, Very good, Nāgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.’</p>
<p>[End of the dilemma as to the Buddha’s harsh words to Sudinna.]</p>
