<h1>7.3.4 The Sal-Tree</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs7"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, that one quality of the Sal-tree which you say he ought to take, which is it?’ <a class="pts-vp-en297"></a></p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the Sal-tree grows within the ground to the depth of a hundred cubits or more; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, perfect in solitude the four Fruits of Samanaship, the four Discriminations, the six forms of transcendental Insight, and all the qualities befitting a recluse. This, O king, is the one quality of the Sal-tree he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Rāhula, the Elder:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“The tree that’s called the Sal-tree grows above the earth,<br>
And shoots beneath, a hundred cubits deep.<br>
As in the fullness of time, and at its highest growth<br>
That tree shoots in one day a hundred cubits high,<br>
Just so do I, O Buddha, like the Sal,<br>
Increase, in solitude, in inward good.”’</p>
