<h1>6.2.7 Dilemma the Sixty-Seventh. Dead Demons</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs19"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, are there such things as demons (Yakkhā) in the world?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, O king.’</p>
<p>‘Do they ever leave that condition’ (fall out of that phase of existence)?</p>
<p>‘Yes, they do.’</p>
<p>‘But, if so, why is it that the remains of those dead Yakkhas are never found, nor any odour of their corpses smelt? ’</p>
<p>‘<a class="pts-vp-pi272"></a>Their remains are found, O king, and an odour does arise from their dead bodies. The remains of bad Yakkhas can be seen in the form of <a class="pts-vp-en109"></a> worms and beetles and ants and moths and snakes and scorpions and centipedes, and birds and wild beasts.’</p>
<p>‘Who else, O Nāgasena, could have solved this puzzle except one as wise as you!’</p>
<p class="endsection">Here ends the dilemma as to dead demons.</p>
