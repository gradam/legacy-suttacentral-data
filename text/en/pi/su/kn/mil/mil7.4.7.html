<h1>7.4.7 The Moon</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en318"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs31"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, those five qualities of the moon which you say he ought to have, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the moon, rising in the bright fortnight, waxes more and more; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, grow more and more in good conduct and righteousness and virtue and the constant performance of duty, and in knowledge of the scriptures and study, and in the habit of retirement, and in self-possession, and in keeping the doors of his senses guarded, and in moderation in food, and in the practice of vigils. This, O king, is the first quality of the moon he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs32"></a>‘And again, O king, as the moon is a mighty lord ; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be a mighty lord over his own will.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en320"></a> well, or a mountain precipice, or a river in flood, would be abashed alike in body and in mind; so be ye, O brethren, as the moon in your visits to the laity. Holding alike in your outward demeanour and your inward spirit, be ye alway, as strangers on their first visit, retiring in the presence of the laity].”’</p>
