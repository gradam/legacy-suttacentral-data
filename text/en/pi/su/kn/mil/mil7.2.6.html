<h1>7.2.6 The Tortoise</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs12"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, those five qualities of the tortoise which you say he ought to take, what are they? ’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the tortoise, which is a water animal, keeps to the water; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, let his heart go out over the whole wide world with pity and with love—mighty, abounding, beyond measure, free from every feeling of hatred or of malice—towards all creatures that have life. This, O king, is the first of the qualities of the tortoise he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs13"></a>‘And again, O king, just as the tortoise, when, as he swims on the water and raises his head, he catches sight of any one, that moment sinks, and dives into the depths, lest they should see him again; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when evil inclinations fall upon him, sink into the waters of meditation, dive down into the deeps thereof, lest those evil inclinations should catch sight of him again. This, O king, is the <a class="pts-vp-en289"></a> second of the qualities of the tortoise he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs14"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi371"></a> ‘And again, O king, just as the tortoise gets up out of the water, and suns himself; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when he rouses himself (withdraws his mind) out of meditation—whether taken sitting, or lying down, or standing, or walking up and down—sun his mind in the Great Struggle against evil dispositions. This, O king, is the third of the qualities of the tortoise he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs15"></a>‘And again, O king, just as the tortoise, digging a hole in the ground, dwells alone; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, giving up worldly gain and honour and praise, take up his abode alone, plunging into the solitudes of empty lonely places in the groves and woods and hills, in caves and grottoes, noiseless and quiet. This, O king, is the fourth of the qualities of the tortoise he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Upasena, the Elder, of the sons of the Vaṅgantas:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Lonely and quiet places, haunts<br>
Of the deer, and of wild beasts,<br>
Should the Bhikshu seek as his abode,<br>
For solitude’s sweet sake.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-cs16"></a>‘And again, O king, as the tortoise, when on his rounds he sees any one, draws in at once all his head and limbs into his shell, and hiding them there, keeps still in silence to save himself; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, wheresoever forms, or sounds, or odours, or tastes, <a class="pts-vp-en290"></a> or feelings strike upon him, shut to the gate of self-restraint at the six doors of his senses, cover up his mind in self-control, and continue constant in mindfulness and thoughtfulness to save his Samanaship. This, O king, is the fifth of the qualities of the tortoise he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the most excellent Saṃyutta Nikāya, in the Sutta of the parable of the tortoise:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“As the tortoise withdraws his limbs in his shell,<br>
Let the Bhikshu bury the thoughts of his mind,<br>
Himself Independent, injuring none,<br>
Set free himself, speaking evil of none.”’</p>
</blockquote>
