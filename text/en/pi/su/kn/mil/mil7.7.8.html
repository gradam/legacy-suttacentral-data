<h1>7.7.8 The Hunter</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi412"></a> ‘Venerable Nāgasena, those four qualities of the hunter you say he ought to have, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the hunter is indefatigable, so also, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be indefatigable. This, O king, is the first quality of the hunter he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs21"></a>‘And again, O king, just as the hunter keeps his attention fixed on the deer; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, keep his <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en359"></a> attention fixed on the particular object which is the subject of his thought. This, O king, is the second quality of the hunter he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs22"></a>‘And again, O king, just as the hunter knows the right time for his work; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, know the right time for retirement, saying to himself: “Now is the right time to retire. Now is the right time to come out of retirement.” This, O king, is the third quality of the hunter he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs23"></a>‘And again, O king, just as the hunter on catching sight of a deer experiences joy at the thought: “Him shall I get!” just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, rejoice at the sight of an object for contemplation, and experience joy at the thought: “Thereby shall I grasp the specific idea of which I am in search.” This, O king, is the fourth quality of the hunter he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Mogharāja, the Elder: <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en360"></a></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“The recluse who, with mind on Nirvāṇa bent,<br>
Has acquired an object his thoughts to guide,<br>
Should be filled with exceeding joy at the hope:<br>
’By this my uttermost aim shall I gain.’”’</p>
