<h1>7.3.7 The Mast</h1>

<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en300"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, that one quality of the mast which you say he ought to take, which is it?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the mast carries ropes and braces and sails ; just so should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, always have mindfulness and self-possession—when going out or coming back, when looking ahead or looking round, when stretching forth his arm or bending it back, when wearing clothes or carrying his bowl, when eating or drinking or swallowing or tasting, when easing himself or walking or standing or sitting, when asleep or awake, when talking and when silent, never should he lose his mindfulness and self-possession. This, O king, is the one quality of the mast he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods:</p>
<p>“Mindful, my brethren, should the Bhikshu remain, and self-possessed. This is my instruction to you.”’</p>
