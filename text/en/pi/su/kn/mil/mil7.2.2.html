<h1>7.2.2 The Cock</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, those five qualities of the cock which you say he ought to take, what are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as a cock goes early and betimes to roost; so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, early and betimes sweep out the open space around the Dāgaba, and having got ready the drinking-water for the day’s use, and dressed himself, and taken his bath, he should bow <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en281"></a> down in reverence before the Dāgaba, and then pay visits to the senior Bhikshus, and, on his return, enter in due time into the chamber of solitude. This, O king, is the first of the qualities of the cock he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4"></a>‘And again, O king, as a cock rises early and betimes; so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, rise early and betimes to sweep out the open space around the Dāgaba, and get ready the drinking-water for the day’s use, and dress himself, and pay his daily reverence to the Dāgaba, and enter into the chamber of solitude. This, O king, is the second of the qualities of the cock he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5"></a>‘And again, O king, as the cock is unremitting in scratching the earth to pick up what he can find to eat; so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, practise continual self-examination and circumspection in taking any nourishment he may find to eat, reminding himself: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi367"></a> “I eat this, seeking not after pleasure, nor after excitement, nor after beauty of body, nor after elegance of form, but merely for the preservation of my body, to keep myself alive, as a means of appeasing the pain of hunger, and of assisting me in the practice of the higher life. Thus shall I put an end to all former sorrow, and give no cause for future sorrow to arise; therein shall I be free from blame, and dwell at ease.” This, O king, is the third of the qualities of the cock he ought to have. For it has been said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Like child’s flesh in the desert wild,<br>
Or smearing grease upon the wheel, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en282"></a><br>
Solely to keep himself alive,<br>
Does he, when feeling faint, take food.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6"></a>‘And again, O king, as the cock, though it has eyes, is blind by night; so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, though he is not blind, be as one blind. Whether in the woods, or on his daily walk for alms in search of food, blind should he be and deaf and dumb to all delights of form, or sound, or taste, or smell, or touch, should not make them the objects of his thought, should pay no special, detailed, attention to them. This, O king, is the fourth of the qualities of the cock he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Mahā Kaccāyana, the Elder:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Let him with eyes be as one blind,<br>
And he who hears be as the deaf, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en283"></a><br>
He who can speak be as the dumb,<br>
The man of strength as were he weak.<br>
As each new object rises to his ken,<br>
On the sweet couch of blest Nirvāṇa’s peace<br>
Let him lie down and rest.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7"></a>‘And again, O king, as the cock, even though persecuted with clods and sticks and clubs and cudgels, will not desert his home; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort—whether he be engaged in robemaking or in building-work, or in any of his daily duties, or in teaching, or in receiving instruction —never give up his presence of mind. For that, O king—his presence of mind—is the home in which he dwells. This, O king, is the fifth of the qualities of the cock he ought to have. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi368"></a> And this, O king, has been said by the Blessed One, the god over all gods:</p>
<p>“And which, O Bhikshus, is the Bhikshu’s resort, the realm which is his own by right?—it is this, the four modes of being mindful and thoughtful.” <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en284"></a></p>
<p>‘And this too, O king, has been said by Sāriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“The elephant distinguishes good food<br>
From bad, he knows what gives him sustenance,<br>
And even when asleep he guards his trunk —<br>
So let each Buddha’s son, earnest in zeal,<br>
Never do violence to the Conqueror’s word,<br>
Nor injury to his self-possession, best of gifts.”’</p>
