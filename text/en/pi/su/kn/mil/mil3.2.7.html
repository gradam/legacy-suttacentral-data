<h1>3.2.7 Will you be reborn?</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7"></a>The king said: ‘Will you, Nāgasena, be reborn?’ <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en76"></a> Nay, great king, what is the use of asking that question again? Have I not already told you that if, when I die, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi49"></a> I die with craving in my heart, I shall; but if not, not ?’</p>
<p>‘Give me an illustration.’</p>
<p>‘Suppose, O king, a man were to render service to the king: and the king, pleased with him, were to bestow an office upon him. And then that he, while living through that appointment, in the full possession and enjoyment of all the pleasures of sense, should publicly declare that the king had repaid him naught. Now would that man, O king, be acting rightly?’</p>
<p>‘Most certainly not.’</p>
<p>‘Just so, great king, what is the use of asking that question again? Have I not already told you that if, when I die, I die with craving in my heart, I shall; and if not, not?’</p>
<p>‘You are ready, Nāgasena, in reply.’</p>
