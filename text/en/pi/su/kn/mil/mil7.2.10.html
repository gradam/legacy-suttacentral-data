<h1>7.2.10.  The Monkey</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs21"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, those two qualities of the monkey which you say he ought to have, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the monkey, when about to take up his abode does so in some such place as a mighty tree, in a lonely place covered all over with branches, a sure place of refuge; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, choose as the teacher under whom to live a man modest, amiable, righteous, of beauty of character, learned in tradition and in the scriptures, lovable, venerable, worthy of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en293"></a> reverence, a speaker of profitable things, meek, clever in admonition, in instruction, and in education, able to arouse, to incite, to gladden —such a friend should he choose as teacher. This, O king, is the first of the qualities of the monkey he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs22"></a>‘And again, O king, as the monkey wanders about, and stands and sits, always on trees, and, if he goes to sleep, spends the night on them; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, stand and walk up and down thinking, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi374"></a> and lie down, and sleep, in the forest, and there enjoy the sense of self-possession. This, O king, is the second of the qualities of the monkey he ought to have. For it has been said, O king, by Sāriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Walking, or standing, sitting, lying down,<br>
’Tis in the forest that the Bhikshu shines.<br>
To dwell in wildernesses far remote<br>
Has been exalted by the Buddhas all.”’</p>
