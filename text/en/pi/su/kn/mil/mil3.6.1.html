<h1>3.6.1 Is the body dear?</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en115"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1"></a>The king said: ‘Is the body, Nāgasena, dear to you recluses?’</p>
<p>‘No, they love not the body.’</p>
<p>‘Then why do you nourish it and lavish attention upon it?’</p>
<p>‘In all the times and places, O king, that you have gone down to battle, did you never get wounded by an arrow?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, that has happened to me.’</p>
<p>‘In such cases, O king, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi74"></a> is not the wound anointed with salve, and smeared with oil, and bound up in a bandage.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, such things are done to it.’</p>
<p>‘What then? Is the wound dear to you that you treat it so tenderly, and lavish such attention upon it?’</p>
<p>‘No, it is not dear to me in spite of all that, which is only done that the flesh may grow again.’</p>
<p>‘Just so, great king, with the recluses and the body. Without cleaving to it do they bear about the body for the sake of righteousness of life. The body, O king, has been declared by the Blessed One to be like a wound. And therefore merely as a sore, and without cleaving to it, do the recluses bear about the, body. For it has been said by the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Covered with clammy skin, an impure thing and foul,<br>
Nine-apertured, it oozes, like a sore.”’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Well answered, Nāgasena!’ <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en116"></a></p>
