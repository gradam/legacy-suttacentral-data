<h1>3.1.11 Aspiration</h1>
</div>
<p>‘And how is aspiration the mark of faith?’</p>
<p>‘In as much as the recluse, on perceiving how the hearts of others have been set free, aspires to enter as it were by a leap upon the fruit of the first stage, or of the second, or of the third in the Excellent Way, or to gain Arahatship itself, and thus applies himself to the attainment of what he has not reached, to the experience of what he has not yet felt, to the realisation of what he has not yet realised—therefore is it that aspiration is the mark of faith.’</p>
<p>‘Give me an illustration.’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as if a mighty storm <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi36"></a> were to break upon a mountain top and pour out rain, the water would flow down according to the levels, and after filling up the crevices and chasms and gullies <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en56"></a> of the hill, would empty itself into the brook below, so that the stream would rush along, overflowing both its banks. Now suppose a crowd of people, one after the other, were to come up, and being ignorant of the real breadth or depth of the water, were to stand fearful and hesitating on the brink. And suppose a certain man should arrive, who knowing exactly his own strength and power should gird himself firmly and, with a spring, land himself on the other side. Then the rest of the people, seeing him safe on the other side, would likewise cross. That is the kind of way in which the recluse, by faith, aspires to leap, as it were by a bound, into higher things. For this has been said, O king, by the Blessed One in the Samyutta Nikāya:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“By faith he crosses over the stream,<br>
By earnestness the sea of life;<br>
By steadfastness all grief he stills,<br>
By wisdom is he purified.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Well put, Nāgasena!’</p>
