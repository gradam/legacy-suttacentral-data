<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14"></a>‘What is the distinguishing characteristic, Nāgasena, of investigation (Vicāra)?’</p>
<p>‘Threshing out again and again.’</p>
<p>‘Give me an illustration.’</p>
<p>‘It is like the case of the copper vessel, which, when it is being beaten into shape <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi63"></a>, makes a sound again and again as it gradually gathers shape. The beating into shape is to be regarded as reflection, and the sounding again and again as investigation. Thus is it, great king, that threshing out again and again is the mark of investigation.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
