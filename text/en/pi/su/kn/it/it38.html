<h1>38 Often Occurring Thoughts</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, two thoughts often occur to the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Fully Enlightened One: the thought of security (for beings) and the thought of solitude.</p>
<p>“The Tathāgata, bhikkhus, is one who delights in and enjoys non-ill will. As the Tathāgata delights in and enjoys non-ill will, this thought often occurs to him: ‘By this behaviour I do not oppress anyone either frail or firm.’The Tathāgata, bhikkhus, is one who delights in and enjoys solitude. As the Tathāgata delights in and enjoys solitude, this thought often occurs to him: ‘What is unwholesome has been abandoned.’</p>
<p>“Therefore, bhikkhus, I say, you too must live delighting in and enjoying non-ill will. As you so live this thought will often occur to you: ‘By this behaviour we do not oppress anyone either frail or firm.’</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, you too must live delighting in and enjoying solitude. As you so live this thought will often occur to you: ‘What is unwholesome? What has not been abandoned? What have we abandoned?’”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Two thoughts occur to him,<br>
The Tathāgata, the Awakened One<br>
Who endured what is beyond endurance:<br>
Security (for beings) was the first thought spoken of,<br>
Solitude was the second announced.</p>
<p>The dispeller of darkness, gone beyond,<br>
The great sage who has reached attainment,<br>
Become a master, freed from taints,<br>
Who has crossed over entirely,<br>
Released by the destruction of craving—<br>
That sage bears his final body,<br>
And having left behind Māra, I say,<br>
He has gone beyond decay.</p>
<p>As one standing on a mountain peak<br>
Might see all round the people down below,<br>
So having ascended the Dhamma-palace,<br>
The vastly wise one, all-seeing,<br>
Views the people of the world.<br>
The sorrowless one views below<br>
Those still immersed in sorrow,<br>
Overwhelmed by birth and decay.</p>
