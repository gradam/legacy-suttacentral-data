<h1>26 Giving</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, if beings knew, as I know, the result of giving and sharing, they would not eat without having given, nor would they allow the stain of meanness to obsess them and take root in their minds. Even if it were their last morsel, their last mouthful, they would not eatwithout having shared it, if there were someone to share it with. But, bhikkhus, as beings do not know, as I know, the result of giving and sharing, they eat without having given, and the stain of meanness obsesses them and takes root in their minds.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>If beings only knew—<br>
So said the Great Sage—<br>
How the result of sharing<br>
Is of such great fruit,<br>
With a gladdened mind,<br>
Rid of the stain of meanness,<br>
They would duly give to noble ones<br>
Who make what is given fruitful.</p>
<p>Having given much food as offerings<br>
To those most worthy of offerings,<br>
The donors go to heaven<br>
On departing the human state.<br>
Having gone to heaven they rejoice,<br>
And enjoying pleasures there,<br>
The unselfish experience the result<br>
Of generously sharing with others.</p>
