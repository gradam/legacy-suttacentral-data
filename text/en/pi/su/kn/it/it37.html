<h1>37 Happiness</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, possessing two things a bhikkhu lives here and now with much pleasure and happiness and is properly motivated for the destruction of the taints. What are the two things? Being moved by a sense of urgency on occasions for urgency, and, being moved, making a proper endeavour. These, bhikkhus, are the two things…”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>A wise person should be urgently moved<br>
On occasions that make for urgency;<br>
As an ardent discerning bhikkhu<br>
He should investigate with wisdom.</p>
<p>One living ardent thus,<br>
Of peaceful conduct, not proud,<br>
Practising tranquillity of mind,<br>
May attain the destruction of suffering.</p>
