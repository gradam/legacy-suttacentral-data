<h1>66 Purity</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of purity. What are the three? Purity of body, purity of speech, and purity of mind. These are the three.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Bodily pure, pure of speech,<br>
Mentally pure and taintless—<br>
A pure one possessing such purity<br>
Is called one who has abandoned all.</p>
</blockquote>
