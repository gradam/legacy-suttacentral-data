<h1>98 Giving</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of giving: the giving of material things and the giving of the Dhamma. Of these two kinds of giving, this is the foremost, namely, the giving of the Dhamma. There are these two kinds of sharing: the sharing of material things and the sharing of the Dhamma. Of these two kinds of sharing, this is the foremost, namely, the sharing of the Dhamma. There are these two kinds of help: help with material things and help with the Dhamma. Of these two kinds of help, this is the foremost, namely, help with the Dhamma.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>When they say that giving<br>
Is supreme and unsurpassed,<br>
And the Lord himself has extolled sharing,<br>
Who, wise and knowing,<br>
Confident in that foremost field of merit,<br>
Would not give at the appropriate time?</p>
<p>Both for those who proclaim it<br>
And for those who listen to it,<br>
Confident in the Sublime One’s teaching,<br>
The supreme good is fully purified<br>
As they live diligently in the teaching.</p>
