<h1>48 A State of Misery</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord. …</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, these two will go to a state of misery, to hell, by not giving up such conduct as this. What two? One who while no liver of the holy life pretends to be one who lives the holy life, and one who falsely accuses another who lives the holy life in complete purity of not living it. These two will go to a state of misery, to hell, by not giving up such conduct as this.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>The false-accuser goes to hell<br>
And also one who denies the deed he did;<br>
Both these become equal hereafter,<br>
Persons of base actions in the world beyond.</p>
<p>Many imposters wear the yellow robe<br>
Though evil-natured and uncontrolled.<br>
Because of their evil deeds,<br>
Those evil ones are born in hell.</p>
<p>Far better for him to swallow<br>
A fiery hot iron ball<br>
Than that immoral and uncontrolled<br>
He should eat the country’s alms.</p>
