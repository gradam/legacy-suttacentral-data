<h1>21 A Confident Mind</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Here, bhikkhus, some person has a confident mind. Having examined his mind with my mind, I know that if this person were to die at this time, as if carried there he would be placed in heaven. What is the reason for that? It is because his mind is confident. It is because of the mind’s confidence that some beings here, when the body perishes, are reborn after death in a good bourn, in a heavenly world.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Understanding the confident mind<br>
Of some person dwelling here,<br>
The Buddha explained its meaning<br>
In the presence of the bhikkhus.</p>
<p>If that person were to die<br>
At this very moment now,<br>
He would arise in a good bourn<br>
Because of his confident mind.</p>
<p>As if they were carried off<br>
And placed there, thus<br>
Beings go to a good bourn<br>
Because of mind’s confidence.</p>
