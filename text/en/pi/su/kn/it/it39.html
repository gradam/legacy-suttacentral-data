<h1>39 Dhamma-teachings</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“There are, bhikkhus, two successive Dhamma-teachings of the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Fully Enlightened One. What are the two? ‘See evil as evil’— this is the first Dhamma-teaching. ‘Having seen evil as evil, be rid of it, be detached from it, be freed from it’—this is the second Dhamma-teaching. These, bhikkhus, are the two successive Dhamma-teachings of the Tathāgata…”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Regard the ordered words he spoke,<br>
The Tathāgata, the Awakened One,<br>
Compassionate for all beings,<br>
And the two things he proclaimed:</p>
<p>“See what is evil” is one,<br>
The other “Be detached from it.”<br>
With a mind become detached from evil<br>
You will make an end of suffering.</p>
