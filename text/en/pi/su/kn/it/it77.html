<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“This body, bhikkhus, is perishable, consciousness is of a nature to dissolve, and all objects of clinging are impermanent, suffering, and subject to change.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Having known the body as perishable<br>
And consciousness as bound to dissolve,<br>
Having seen fear in objects of clinging,<br>
He has gone beyond birth and death;<br>
Having attained supreme peace,<br>
With composed mind he bides his time.</p>
