<h1>112 The World</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord, said by the Arahant, so I heard:</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, the world has been fully understood by the Tathāgata; the Tathāgata is released from the world. The origin of the world has been fully understood by the Tathāgata; the origin of the world has been abandoned by the Tathāgata. The cessation of the world has been fully understood by the Tathāgata; the cessation of the world has been realized by the Tathāgata. The course leading to the cessation of the world has been fully understood by the Tathāgata; the course leading to the cessation of the world has been developed by the Tathāgata.</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, in the world with its devas, māras, and brahmās, with its recluses and brahmins, among humankind with its princes and people, whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought, and reflected upon by the mind—that is fully understood by the Tathāgata: therefore he is called the Tathāgata.</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, from the night when the Tathāgata awakened to unsurpassed full enlightenment until the night when he passes away into the Nibbāna-element with no residue left, whatever he speaks, utters, and explains—all that is just so and not otherwise: therefore he is called the Tathāgata.</p>
<p>“As the Tathāgata says, so he does; as the Tathāgata does, so he says: therefore he is called the Tathāgata.</p>
<p>“In the world with its devas, māras, and brahmās, with its recluses and brahmins, among humankind with its princes and people, the Tathāgata is the conqueror, unvanquished, all-seer, wielding power: therefore he is called the Tathāgata.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>By knowledge of the whole world,<br>
The whole world as it truly is,<br>
He is released from all the world,<br>
In all the world he is unattached.</p>
<p>The all-conquering heroic sage,<br>
Freed from every bond is he;<br>
He has reached that perfect peace,<br>
Nibbāna which is free from fear.</p>
<p>Rid of taints, he is enlightened,<br>
Trouble-free, with doubts destroyed,<br>
Reached the final end of deeds,<br>
Released by clinging’s full destruction.</p>
<p>The Enlightened One, the Lord,<br>
A lion is he, unsurpassed;<br>
For in the world together with its devas<br>
He set the Brahma-wheel in motion.</p>
<p>Thus those devas and human beings,<br>
Gone for refuge to the Buddha,<br>
On meeting him pay homage to him,<br>
The great one free from diffidence.</p>
<p>Tamed, of the tamed he is the best;<br>
Calmed, of the calmed he is the seer;<br>
Freed, of the freed he is the foremost;<br>
Crossed, of the crossed he is the chief.</p>
<p>Thus do they pay him due homage,<br>
The great one free from diffidence:<br>
“In the world together with its devas<br>
There is no person equalling you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This too is the meaning of what was said by the Lord, so I heard.</p>
