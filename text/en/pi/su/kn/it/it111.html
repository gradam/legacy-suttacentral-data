<h1>111 Perfect in Virtue</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, you should live perfect in virtue, perfect in the practice of the rules of discipline, and be restrained by the restraint of the rules. Perfect in conduct and resort, seeing danger in the slightest faults, you should train in the rules of training you have undertaken. Living perfect in virtue, bhikkhus, … and training in the rules of training you have undertaken, what is there further that should be done?</p>
<p>“If while he is walking, standing, sitting, and lying down a bhikkhu is free from covetousness and ill will, free from sloth and torpor, free from restlessness and worry, and has abandoned doubts, his energy becomes strong and unflagging, his mindfulness is alert and unclouded, his body is calm and undistressed, his mind concentrated and one-pointed. A bhikkhu who in such a manner is ardent and afraid of wrongdoing is called constantly energetic and resolute.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Controlled while walking,<br>
Controlled while standing,<br>
Controlled while sitting,<br>
Controlled while reclining,<br>
Controlled in bending and<br>
Stretching his limbs—<br>
Above, across, and below,<br>
As far as the world extends,<br>
A bhikkhu observes how things occur,<br>
The arising and passing of the aggregates.</p>
<p>Living thus ardently,<br>
Of calm and quiet conduct,<br>
Ever mindful, he trains in the course<br>
Of calm tranquillity of mind.<br>
Such a bhikkhu is said to be<br>
One who is ever resolute.</p>
