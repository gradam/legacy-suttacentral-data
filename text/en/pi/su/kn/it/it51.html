<h1>51 Elements</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord …</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, there are these three elements. What three? The form element, the formless element, and the element of cessation. These are the three.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>By fully understanding the form element<br>
Without getting stuck in the formless,<br>
They are released into cessation<br>
And leave Death far behind them.</p>
<p>Having touched with his own person<br>
The deathless element free from clinging,<br>
Having realized the relinquishment of clinging<br>
His taints all gone,<br>
The Fully Enlightened One proclaims<br>
The sorrowless state that is void of stain.</p>
