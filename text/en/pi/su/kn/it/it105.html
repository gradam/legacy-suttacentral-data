<h1>105 Arousing Craving</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, there are four things that arouse craving whereby the craving that has arisen in a bhikkhu arises. What are the four? Because of robes, because of almsfood, because of a dwelling place, because of gaining this or losing thatthe craving that has arisen in a bhikkhu arises. These, bhikkhus, are the four things that arouse craving whereby the craving that has arisen in a bhikkhu arises.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>A person companioned by craving<br>
Wanders on the long journey<br>
In this state of being or another<br>
And cannot go beyond saṃsāra.</p>
<p>Having understood the danger thus,<br>
That craving is the origin of suffering,<br>
A bhikkhu should wander mindfully,<br>
Free from craving, without grasping.</p>
