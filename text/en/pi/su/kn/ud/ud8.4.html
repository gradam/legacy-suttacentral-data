<h1>The Fourth Discourse about Nibbāna</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then at that time the Gracious One was instructing, rousing, enthusing, and cheering the monks with a Dhamma talk connected with Emancipation. Those monks, after making it their goal, applying their minds, considering it with all their mind, were listening to Dhamma with an attentive ear.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“For the dependent there is agitation,<br>
for the independent there is no agitation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“When there is no agitation there is calm,<br>
when there is calm there is no inclining.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“When there is no inclining,<br>
there is no coming or going.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“When there is no coming or going,<br>
there is no passing away and rebirth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“When there is no passing away and rebirth,<br>
there is no here or hereafter or in between the two—<br>
just this is the end of suffering.”</p>
