<h1>The Discourse about the Destruction of Craving</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then at that time venerable Aññātakoṇḍañña <span class="add">Koṇḍañña, he-who-knows</span> was sitting not far away from the Gracious One, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, reflecting on his own freedom through the complete destruction of craving. The Gracious One saw venerable Aññātakoṇḍañña sat not far away, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, reflecting on his own freedom through the complete destruction of craving.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“For he who has no roots, no ground, and no leaves, how then creepers?<br>
That firm one free from bonds—who is worthy <span class="add">enough</span> to blame him?<br>
The devas praise him, and he has also been praised by Brahma.”</p>
