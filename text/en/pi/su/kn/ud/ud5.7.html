<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then at that time venerable Kaṅkhārevata <span class="supplied">Doubting Revata</span> was sitting not far away from the Gracious One, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, reflecting on his own purification through crossing over doubt.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>The Gracious One saw venerable Kaṅkhārevata sat not far away, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, reflecting on his own purification through crossing over doubt.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Whatever doubts there are <span class="supplied">about</span> here or hereafter,<br>
Understandable by oneself, or understandable by another,<br>
The meditators give up all these,<br>
The ardent ones living the spiritual life.”</p>
