<h1>The Discourse about Visākhā</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, at the Eastern Monastery in Migāra’s mother’s mansion. Then at that time Migāra’s mother Visākhā’s grand-daughter, who was beloved and dear, had died.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Then Migāra’s mother Visākhā, with wet clothes and hair, in the middle of the day went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, she sat down on one side.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>While sat on one side the Gracious One said this to Migāra’s mother Visākhā: “Now where have you come from, Visākhā, with wet clothes and hair, <span class="supplied">and why are you</span> coming here in the middle of the day?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“My grand-daughter, who was beloved and dear, reverend Sir, has died. That is why, with wet clothes and hair, I am coming here in the middle of the day.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Would you like, Visākhā, as many children and grand-children as there are people in Sāvatthī?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“I would like, Gracious One, as many children and grand-children as there are people in Sāvatthī.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“But how many people, Visākhā, die every day in Sāvatthī?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“Ten people, reverend Sir, die every day in Sāvatthī, nine people, reverend Sir, die every day in Sāvatthī, eight people, reverend Sir, die every day in Sāvatthī, seven people, reverend Sir, die every day in Sāvatthī, six people, reverend Sir, die every day in Sāvatthī, five people, reverend Sir, die every day in Sāvatthī, four people, reverend Sir, die every day in Sāvatthī, three people, reverend Sir, die every day in Sāvatthī, two people, reverend Sir, die every day in Sāvatthī, one person, reverend Sir, dies every day in Sāvatthī, Sāvatthī is never secluded from people who are dying.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“Now what do you think, Visākhā, would you ever be without wet clothes and hair?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>“Surely not, reverend Sir, I have had enough, reverend Sir, with so many children and grand-children!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>“For those who have a hundred loves, Visākhā, they have a hundred sufferings, for those who have ninety loves, they have ninety sufferings, for those who have eighty loves, they have eighty sufferings, for those who have seventy loves, they have seventy sufferings, for those who have sixty loves, they have sixty sufferings, for those who have fifty loves, they have fifty sufferings, for those who have forty loves, they have forty sufferings, for those who have thirty loves, they have thirty sufferings, for those who have twenty loves, they have twenty sufferings, for those who have ten loves, they have ten sufferings, for those who have nine loves, they have nine sufferings, for those who have eight loves, they have eight sufferings, for those who have seven loves, they have seven sufferings, for those who have six loves, they have six sufferings, for those who have five loves, they have five sufferings, for those who have four loves, they have four sufferings, for those who have three loves, they have three sufferings, for those who have two loves, they have two sufferings, for those who have one love, they have one suffering, for those who love nothing, they have no sorrow. They are griefless, dust-free, and without despair, I say.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>“Whatever griefs or lamentations there are,<br>
And the many kinds of suffering in the world,<br>
These <span class="supplied">all</span> arise because of love,<br>
Without loves, these do not originate.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a>“Therefore they are happy and free from grief,<br>
Who are without love for anything in the world,<br>
Therefore those wanting what is griefless, dust-free,<br>
Should not have love for anything in the world.”</p>
</blockquote>
