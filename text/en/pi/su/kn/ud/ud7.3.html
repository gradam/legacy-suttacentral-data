<h1>The Discourse about Clinging</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then at that time almost all the people in Sāvatthī clung exceedingly to sense pleasures, delighted, greedy, tied, infatuated, and indulgent, they dwelt having become completely intoxicated with sense pleasures.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Then many monks, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up their bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms, and after walking for alms in Sāvatthī, while returning from the alms-round after the meal, went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, they sat down on one side. While sat on one side those monks said this to the Gracious One: “Here, reverend Sir, almost all the people in Sāvatthī cling exceedingly to sense pleasures, delighted, greedy, tied, infatuated, and indulgent, they dwell having become completely intoxicated with sense pleasures.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Clinging to sense pleasures, clinging to the shackle of sense pleasures,<br>
Not seeing the fault in the fetters,<br>
For sure those clinging to the shackle of the fetters<br>
Cannot cross over the wide and great flood.”</p>
