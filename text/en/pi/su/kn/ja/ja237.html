<p>“Why are hearts cold,” etc.—This story the Master told during a stay near Saketa, about a brahmin named Saketa. Both the circumstances that suggested the story and the story itself have already been given in the First Book .</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en163"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi235"></a>...And when the Tathagata had gone to the monastery, the Brother asked, “How, Sir, did the love begin? “and repeated the first stanza—</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Why are hearts cold to one—O Buddha, tell!—<br>
And love another so exceeding well?”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>The Master explained the nature of love by the second stanza:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Those love they who in other lives were dear,<br>
As sure as grows the lotus in the mere.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this discourse was ended, the Master identified the Birth—“These two people were the brahmin and his wife in the story; and I was their son.”</p>
