<p><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi169"></a>“Take thought of life hereafter.” This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana about the offering of a sacrifice under vow to gods. Tradition says that in those days folk when going a journey on business, used to slay living creatures and offer them as a sacrifice to gods, and set out on their way, after making this vow,—“If we come safely back with a profit, we will give you another sacrifice.” And when they did come safely back with a profit, the Idea that this was all due to gods made them slay a number of living creatures and offer them up as a sacrifice to obtain a release from their vow.</p>
<p>When the Brethren became aware of this, they asked the Blessed One, saying, “Can there be any good in this, sir?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One told this story of the past.</p>
<hr>
<p>Once on a time in the Kasi country the squire of a certain little village had promised a sacrifice to the Fairy of a banyan-tree which stood at the entrance to the village. Afterwards when he returned, he slew a number <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en54"></a> of creatures and betook himself to the tree to get released from his vow. But the Tree-Fairy, standing in the fork of its tree, repeated this stanza—</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Take thought of life hereafter when you seek<br>
‘Release’; for this release is bondage strict.<br>
Not thus the wise and good release themselves;<br>
For this, the fool’s release, in bondage ends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thenceforth, men refrained from such taking of life, and by walking in righteousness thronged thereafter the city of the Devas.</p>
<hr>
<p>His lesson ended, the Master shewed the connexion and identified the Birth, by saying, “I was the Tree-fairy of those days.”</p>
