<p><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi474"></a>“Who sagely meditates.”—This story too was told by the Master while at Jetavana about the interpretation of a problem by the Elder Sariputta at the gate of Samkassa.</p>
<hr>
<p>Once on a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta, as he expired in his forest-home, answered his disciples’ enquiries with the words—“Moonlight and Sunlight.” With these words he died and passed to the Radiant Realm.</p>
<p>Now when the chief disciple interpreted the Master’s words his fellows did not believe him. Then back came the Bodhisatta and from mid-air recited this stanza—</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Who sagely meditates on sun and moon,<br>
Shall win (when Reason unto Ecstasy<br>
Gives place) his after-lot in Radiant Realms .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such was the Bodhisatta’s teaching, and, first praising his disciple, he went his way back to the Brahma Realm.</p>
<hr>
<p>His lesson ended, the Master identified the Birth by saying, “Sariputta was the chief disciple of those days, and I Maha-Brahma.”</p>
