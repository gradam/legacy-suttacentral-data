<p>“Our old friend,” etc.—The Master told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning a greedy Brother. The occasion is as above.</p>
<p>Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was a pigeon and lived in a nest-basket in the kitchen of a <a class="pts-vp-en196"></a> Benares merchant. A crow became intimate with him and lived there also. Here the story is to be expanded. The cook pulled out the crow’s feathers and sprinkled him with flour, then piercing a cowrie he hung it on the crow’s neck and threw him into a basket. The Bodhisatta came from the wood, and seeing him made a jest and spoke the first stanza—</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Our old friend! look at him!<br>
A jewel bright he wears;<br>
His beard in gallant trim,<br>
How gay our friend appears!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi315"></a>The crow hearing him spoke the second stanza—</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>My nails and hair had grown so fast,<br>
They hampered me in all I did:<br>
A barber came along at last,<br>
And of superfluous hair I’m rid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the Bodhisatta spoke the third stanza—</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Granted you got a barber then,<br>
Who has cropped your hair so well:<br>
Round your neck, will you explain,<br>
What’s that tinkling like a bell?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the crow uttered two stanzas—</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Men of fashion wear a gem<br>
Round the neck: it’s often done:<br>
I am imitating them:<br>
Don’t suppose it’s just for fun.</p>
<p>If you’re really envious<br>
Of my beard that’s trimmed so true:<br>
I can get you barbered thus;<br>
You may have the jewel too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bodhisatta hearing him spoke the sixth stanza—</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Nay, ’Tis you they best become,<br>
Gem and beard that’s trimmed so true.<br>
I find your presence troublesome:<br>
I go with a good-day to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi316"></a>With these words he flew up and went elsewhere; and the crow died then and there.</p>
<p>After the lesson, the Master declared the Truths and identified the Birth—After the Truths, the greedy Brother was established in the fruition of the Third Path: “At that time the crow was the greedy Brother, the pigeon was myself.”</p>
