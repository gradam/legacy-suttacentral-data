<p>“See that twice-born bird,” etc.—This story the Master told while staying in Jetavana, about a hypocrite. When he was brought before the Master, the Master said, “Brethren, he was a hypocrite of old just as he is now,” and told the following story.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en162"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi234"></a>Once on a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta became a Fish in a certain pond in the Himalaya region, and a great shoal went with him. Now a Crane desired to eat the fish. So in a place near the pond he drooped his head, and spread out his wings, and looked vacantly, vacantly at the fish, waiting till they were off their guard . At the same moment the Bodhisatta with his shoal came to that place in search of food. And the shoal of fish on seeing the crane uttered the first stanza—</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“See that twice-born bird, how white—<br>
Like a water-lily seeming;<br>
Wings outspread to left and right—<br>
Oh, how pious! dreaming, dreaming!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the Bodhisatta looked, and uttered the second stanza:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“What he is ye do not know,<br>
Or you would not sing his praises.<br>
He is our most treacherous foe;<br>
That is why no wing he raises.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thereupon the fish splashed in the water and drove the crane away.</p>
<hr>
<p>When this discourse was ended, the Master identified the Birth—“This hypocrite was the Crane, and I was the chief of the shoal of fish.”</p>
