<h1>52. Cula-Janaka Jātaka</h1>
</div>
<p>“Toil on, my brother.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about another backsliding Brother. All the incidents that are to be related here, will be given in the Maha-janaka Jātaka .</p>
<p>The king, seated beneath the white canopy of sovereignty, recited this stanza—</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Toil on, my brother; still in hope stand fast;<br>
Faint not, nor tire, though harassed sore.<br>
Myself I see, who, all my woes o’erpast,<br>
Have fought my stubborn way ashore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here too the backsliding Brother won Arahatship. The All-wise Buddha was King Janaka.</p>
