<p>“Lo! countless trees,” etc.—This story the Master dwelling at Jetavana told concerning the Veranja section . When the Master after passing the rainy season at Veranja in due course arrived at Savatthi, the Brethren in the Hall of Truth raised a discussion saying, “Sirs, a Tathagata, a delicately nurtured kshatriya and Buddha, though possessed of supernatural powers, at the invitation of a brahmin of Veranja stayed three months with him, and when owing to the temptation of Mara he failed to receive an alms at the hands of the brahmin, even for a single day, he gave up all covetous ways, and keeping in the same place for three months lived on water and a modicum of the ground flour of roots. [4951 Oh the contented nature of Tathagatas!” When the Master came and on inquiry learned the nature of their discussion he said, “It is no marvel, Brethren, that a Tathagata now has lost all covetousness, seeing that formerly when born in an animal form he forsook covetousness.” And hereupon he told a story of the past. The whole story is now to be related in detail in exactly the same way as in the preceding tale.</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Lo! countless trees are here, all green and fruitful see!<br>
Why, parrot, dost thou cling to this poor withered tree?</p>
<p>Long years we have enjoyed the luscious fruit it bare,<br>
And tho’ it now has none, it still should claim our care.</p>
<p>Nor leaves nor fruit it yields, alas! the tree is dead:<br>
Why blame thy fellow-birds, that they should all have fled?</p>
<p>They loved it for its fruit, and now that it has none,<br>
Poor selfish fools! their love and gratitude is gone.</p>
<p>Thy gratitude I own, thy true and constant love,<br>
Sure virtue such as this the wise will aye approve.</p>
<p>I offer thee, O bird, whate’er thou wilt for choice;<br>
Tell me, I pray, what boon would most thy heart rejoice?</p>
<p>Would that this tree alight bear fresh leaves and fruit again;<br>
I would be glad as they that treasure trove obtain.</p>
<p>Then was the tree by Sakka with ambrosia sprinkled o’er,<br>
And boughs sprang up with cooling shade, as lovely as before.</p>
<p>May Sakka and all loved by Sakka blessed be,<br>
As I to-day am blest this joyous sight to see.</p>
<p>Thus was the tree made fruitful by the parrot’s grateful choice,<br>
And Sakka and his queen in groves of Nandana rejoice.</p>
