<h1>4. To Soṇadaṇḍa</h1>
<p class="subheading">Characteristics Of The True Brahman</p>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi111"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en136"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. The Blessed One once, when going on a tour through the Anga country with a great multitude of the brethren, with about five hundred brethren, arrived at Campā. And there at Campā he lodged on the bank of the Gaggarā Lake.</p>
<p>Now at that time the Brahman Soṇadaṇḍa was dwelling at Campā, a place teeming with life, with much grassland and woodland and water and corn, on a royal domain granted him by Seniya Bimbisāra, the king of Magadhā, as a royal fief, with power over it as if he were the king.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2"></a>Now the Brahmans and householders of Campā heard the news: ‘They say that the Samaṇa Gotama of the Sākya clan, who went out from a Sākya family to adopt the religious life, has now arrived, with a great <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en145"></a>company of the brethren at Campā, and is staying there on the shore of the Gaggarā Lake. Now regarding that venerable Gotama, such is the high reputation that has been noised abroad; That Blessed One is an Arahat, a fully awakened one, abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be led, a teacher for gods and men, a Blessed One, a Buddha. He, by himself, thoroughly knows and sees, as it were, face to face this universe—including the worlds above of the gods, the Brahmas, and the Māras, and the world below with its recluses and Brahmans, its princes and peoples—and having known it, he makes his knowledge known to others. The truth, lovely in its origin, lovely in its progress, lovely in its consummation, doth he proclaim, both in the spirit and in the letter, the higher life cloth he make known, in all its fullness and in all its purity.</p>
<p>‘And good is it to pay visits to Arahats like that.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi112"></a>And the Brahmans and householders of Campā began to leave Campā in companies and in bands from each district, so that they could be counted, to go to the Gaggarā Lake.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3"></a>Now at that time Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman had gone apart to the upper terrace of his house for his siesta, and seeing the people thus go by, he said to his doorkeeper: ‘Why are the people of Campā going forth like this towards the Gaggarā Lake?’</p>
<p>Then the doorkeeper told him the news. And he said: ‘Then, good doorkeeper, go to the Brahmans and householders of Campā, and say to them: “Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman desires them to wait. He will himself come to see the Samaṇa Gotama.”’</p>
<p>‘Very well, Sir,’ said the doorkeeper, and he did so.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi113"></a>Now at that time there were about five hundred Brahmans from different kingdoms lodging at Campā for some business or other. And when they heard that Soṇadaṇḍa was intending to visit the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en146"></a>Samaṇa Gotama, they went to Soṇadaṇḍa, and asked whether that was so.</p>
<p>‘That is my intention, Sirs. I propose to call on the Samaṇa Gotama.’</p>
<p>‘Let not the venerable Soṇadaṇḍa do that. It is not fitting for him to do so. If it were the venerable Soṇadaṇḍa who went to call upon him, then the venerable Soṇadaṇḍa’s reputation would decrease and the Samaṇa Gotama’s would increase. This is the first reason why you, Sir, should not call upon him, but he upon you.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5"></a>And they laid before Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman in like manner also other considerations, to wit:</p>
<p>That he was well born on both sides, of pure descent through the mother and through the father back through seven generations, with no slur put upon him, and no reproach, in respect of birth.—</p>
<p>That he was prosperous, well to do, and rich—</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi114"></a>That he was a repeater (of the sacred words), knowing the mystic verses by heart, one who had mastered the Three Vedas, with the indices, the ritual, the phonology, and the exegesis (as a fourth), and the legends as a fifth, learned in the words and in the grammar, versed in Lokāyata (Nature-lore), and in the theory of the signs on the body of a great man—</p>
<p>That he was handsome, pleasant to look upon, inspiring trust, gifted with great beauty of complexion, fair in colour, fine in presence, stately to behold—</p>
<p>That he was virtuous, increased in virtue, gifted with virtue that had waxed great—</p>
<p>That he had a pleasant voice and pleasing delivery, and was gifted with polite address, distinct, not husky, suitable for making clear the matter in hand—</p>
<p>That he was the teacher of the teachers of many, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en147"></a>instructing three hundred Brahmans in the repetition of the mystic verses, and that many young Brahmans, from various directions and various counties, all craving for the verses, came to learn them by heart under him—</p>
<p>That he was aged, old, and well stricken in years, long-lived and full of days—</p>
<p>That he was honoured, held of weight, esteemed worthy, venerated and revered by Seniya Bimbisāra, the king of Magadhā—</p>
<p>That he was honoured, held of weight, esteemed worthy, venerated and revered by Pokkharasādi, the Brahman—</p>
<p>That he dwelt at Campā, a place teeming with life, with much grassland and woodland and corn, on a royal fief granted him by Seniya Bimbisāra, the king of Magadhā, as a royal gift, with power over it as if he were the king—</p>
<p>For each of these reasons it was not fitting that he, Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman, should call upon the Samaṇa Gotama, but rather that the Samaṇa Gotama should call upon him.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6"></a>And when they had thus spoken, Soṇadaṇḍa said to them:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi115"></a>‘Then, Sirs, listen, and hear why it is fitting that I should call upon the venerable Gotama, and not he should call upon me—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, the venerable Gotama is well born on both sides, of pure descent through the mother and the father back through seven generations, with no slur put upon him, and no reproach in respect of birth—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, the Samaṇa Gotama has gone forth (into the religious life), giving up the great clan of his relations—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, the Samaṇa Gotama has gone forth (into the religious life), giving up much money and gold, treasure both buried and above the ground—</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en148"></a>‘Truly, Sirs, the Samaṇa Gotama, while he was still a young man, without a grey hair on his head, in the beauty of his early manhood, has gone forth from the household life into the homeless state—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, the Samaṇa Gotama, though his father and mother were unwilling, and wept, their cheeks being wet with tears, nevertheless cut off his hair and beard, and donned the yellow robes, and went out from the household life into the homeless state—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, the Samaṇa Gotama is handsome, pleasant to look upon, inspiring trust, gifted with great beauty of complexion, fair in colour, fine in presence, stately to behold—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, the Samaṇa Gotama is virtuous with the virtue of the Arahats, good and virtuous, gifted with goodness and virtue—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, the Samaṇa Gotama hath a pleasant voice, and a pleasing delivery, he is gifted with polite address, distinct, not husky, suitable for making clear the matter in hand—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, the Samaṇa Gotama is the teacher of the teachers of many—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, the Samaṇa Gotama has no passion of lust left in him, and has put away all fickleness of mind—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, the Samaṇa Gotama believes in Karma, and in action, he is one who puts righteousness in the forefront (of his exhortations) to the Brahman race—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, the Samaṇa Gotama went forth from a distinguished family primeval among the Kshatriya clans—</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en149"></a>‘Truly, Sirs, the Samaṇa Gotama went forth from a family prosperous, well to do, and rich—</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi116"></a>‘Truly, Sirs, people come right across the country from distant lands to ask questions of the Samaṇa Gotama—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, multitudes of heavenly beings put their trust in the Samaṇa Gotama—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, such is the high reputation noised abroad concerning the Samaṇa Gotama, that he is said to be an Arahat, exalted, fully awakened, abounding in wisdom and righteousness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds, a Blessed One, a Buddha—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, the Samaṇa Gotama has all the thirty-two bodily marks of a Great Being—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, the Samaṇa Gotama bids all men welcome, is congenial, conciliatory, not supercilious, accessible to all, not backward in conversation—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, the Samaṇa Gotama is honoured, held of weight, esteemed and venerated and revered by the four classes (of his followers—the brethren and sisters of the Order, laymen and lay women)—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, many gods and men believe in the Samaṇa Gotama—</p>
<p>“Truly, Sirs, in whatsoever village or town the Samaṇa Gotama stays, there the non-humans do the humans no harm—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, the Samaṇa Gotama as the head of an Order, of a school, as the teacher of a school, is the acknowledged chief of all the founders of sects. Whereas some Samaṇas and Brahmans have gained a reputation by all sorts of insignificant matters, not <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en150"></a>so the Samaṇa Gotama. His reputation comes from perfection in conduct and righteousness—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, the king of Magadhā, Seniya Bimbisāra, with his children and his wives, with his people and his courtiers, has put his trust in the Samaṇa Gotama—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, King Pasenadi of Kosala, with his children and his wives, with his people and his courtiers, has put his trust in the Samaṇa Gotama—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, Pokkharasādi the Brahman, with his children and his wives, with his people and his intimates, has put his trust in the Samaṇa Gotama—</p>
<p>‘Truly, Sirs, the Samaṇa Gotama is honoured, held of weight, esteemed, and venerated and revered alike by Seniya Bimbisāra, the king of Magadhā, by Pasenadi the king of Kosala, and by Pokkharasādi the Brahman—</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi117"></a>‘Truy, Sirs, the Samaṇa Gotama has now arrived at Campā and is staying on the shores of the Gaggarā Lake. But all Samaṇas and Brahmans who come into our village borders are our guests. And guests we ought to esteem and honour, to venerate and revere. And as he is now so come, he ought to be so treated, as a guest—</p>
<p>‘For each and all of these considerations it is not fitting that the Samaṇa Gotama should call upon us, but rather does it behove us to call upon him. And so far only do I know the excellencies of the Samaṇa Gotama, but these are not all of them, for his excellence is beyond measure.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7"></a>And when he had thus spoken, those Brahmans said to him: ‘The venerable Soṇadaṇḍa declares the praises of the Samaṇa Gotama on such wise, that were he to be dwelling even a hundred leagues from here, it would be enough to make a believing man go thither to call upon him, even had he to carry a bag (for the provisions for the journey) on his back. Let us then all go to call on the Samaṇa Gotama together!’</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en151"></a>So Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman went out to the Gaggarā Lake with a great company of Brahmans.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8"></a>Now the following hesitation arose in Soṇadaṇḍa’s mind as he passed through the wood: ‘Were I to ask the Samaṇa Gotama a question, if he were to say: “The question ought not to be asked so, thus ought the question to be framed;” the company might thereupon speak of me with disrespect, saying: “Foolish is this Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman, and inexpert. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi118"></a>He is not even able to ask a question rightly.” But if they did so my reputation would decrease; and with my reputation my incomings would grow less, for what we have to enjoy, that depends on our reputation. But if the Samaṇa Gotama were to put a question to me, I might not be able to gain his approval by my explanation of the problem. And if they were then to say to me: “The question ought not to be answered so; thus ought the problem to be explained;” the company might thereupon speak of me with disrespect, saying: “Foolish is this Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman, and inexpert. He is not even able to satisfy the Samaṇa Gotama by his explanation of the problem put.” But if they did so, my reputation would decrease; and with my reputation my incomings would grow less, for what we have to enjoy, that depends upon our reputation. But on the other hand if, having come so far, I should turn back without calling upon the Samaṇa Gotama, then might the company speak disrespectfully of me, saying: “Foolish is this Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman, and inexpert, though obstinate with pride, he is so afraid that he dare not call on the Samaṇa Gotama. How can he turn back after having come so far?” But if they did so, my reputation would decrease; and with my reputation my incomings would grow less. For what we have to enjoy, that depends upon our reputation.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9"></a>So Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman went up to where the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en152"></a>Blessed One was. And when he had come there he exchanged with the Blessed One the greetings and compliments of politeness and courtesy, and took his seat on one side. And as to the Brahmans and householders of Campā, some of them bowed to the Blessed One and took their seats on one side; some of them exchanged with him the greetings and compliments of politeness and courtesy, and then took their seats on one side; some of them called out their name and family, and then took their seats on one side; and some of them took their seats on one side in silence.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi119"></a>Now as Soṇadaṇḍa was seated there he was still filled with hesitation, thinking as before set out; and he added to himself: ‘Oh! would that the Samaṇa Gotama would but ask me some question on my own subject, on the threefold Vedic lore. Verily, I should then be able to gain his approval by my exposition of the problem put!’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11"></a>Now the Blessed One became aware in his own mind of the hesitation in the mind of Soṇadaṇḍa, and he thought: ‘This Soṇadaṇḍa is afflicted in his heart. I had better question him on his own doctrine.’ And he said to him: ‘What are the things, Brahman, which the Brahmans say a man ought to have in order to be a Brahman, so that if he says: “I am a Brahman,” he speaks accurately and does not become guilty of falsehood?’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs12"></a>Then Soṇadaṇḍa thought: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi120"></a>‘What I wished and desired and had in my mind and hoped for—that the Samaṇa Gotama should put to me some question on my own subject, on the threefold Vedic lore—that he now does. Oh! that I may be able to satisfy his heart with my exposition thereof!’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13"></a>And drawing his body up erect, and looking round on the assembly, he said to the Blessed One: ‘The Brahmans, Gotama, declare him to be a Brahman who can accurately say “I am a Brahman” without being guilty of falsehood, who has five things. And what are the five? In the first place, Sir, a Brahman is well born on both sides, on the mother’s side and on <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en153"></a>the father’s side, of pure descent back through seven generations, with no slur put upon him, and no reproach, in respect of birth—</p>
<p>‘Then he is a repeater (of the sacred words), knowing the mystic verses by heart, one who has mastered the Three Vedas, with the indices, the ritual, the phonology, and the exegesis (as a fourth), and the legends as a fifth, learned in the phrases and in the grammar, versed in Lokāyata sophistry, and in the theory of the signs on the body of a great man—</p>
<p>‘Then he is handsome, pleasant to look upon, inspiring trust, gifted with great beauty of complexion, fair in colour, fine in presence, stately to behold—</p>
<p>‘Then he is virtuous, increased in virtue, gifted with virtue that has grown great—</p>
<p>‘Then he is learned and wise, the first, or it may be the second, among those who hold out the ladle.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14"></a>‘But of these five things, oh Brahman, is it possible to leave one out, and to declare the man who has the other four to be a Brahman, to be one who can accurately, and without falling into falsehood, claim to be a Brahman?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, Gotama, that can be done. We could leave out colour. For what does colour matter? <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi121"></a>If he have the other four—good birth, technical training, virtue, and wisdom, as just set forth-Brahmans would still declare him to be a Brahman; and he could rightly, without danger of falsehood, claim to be one.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15"></a>‘But of these four things, oh Brahman, is it possible to leave one out, and to declare the man who has the other three to be a Brahman, to be one who can rightly, and without falling into falsehood, claim to be a Brahman?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, Gotama, that could be done. We could leave out the verses. For what do the verses matter? If <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en154"></a>he have the other three—good birth, virtue, and wisdom—Brahmans would still declare him to be a Brahman; and he could rightly, without danger of falsehood, claim to be one.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16"></a>‘But of these three things, Brahman, is it possible to leave one out, and to declare the man who has the other two to be a Brahman, to be one who can accurately, and without falling into falsehood, claim to be a Brahman?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, Gotama, that could be done. We could leave out birth. For what does birth matter? If he have the other two—virtue and wisdom—Brahmans would still declare him to be a Brahman; and he could rightly, without danger of falsehood, claim to be one.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi122"></a>And when he had thus spoken the other Brahmans said to Soṇadaṇḍa: ‘Say not so, venerable Soṇadaṇḍa, say not so! He depreciates not only our colour, but he depreciates our verses and our birth. Verily the venerable Soṇadaṇḍa is going over to the doctrine of the Samaṇa Gotama.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18"></a>Then the Blessed One said to those Brahmans: ‘If you, oh Brahmans, think that Soṇadaṇḍa is unlearned, that he speaks unfittingly, that he is unwise, that he is unable to hold his own with me in this matter, let him keep silence, and do you discuss with me. But if you think him learned, able in speech, wise, able to hold his own, then do you keep silence, and let him discuss with me.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19"></a>And when he had thus spoken, Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman said to those Brahmans: ‘Let not the venerable ones say so. Say not so, Sirs. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi123"></a>I do not depreciate either our colour, nor our verses, nor our birth.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20"></a>Now at that time a young Brahman named Angaka, sister’s son to Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman, was seated in that company. And Soṇadaṇḍa said to those <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en155"></a>Brahmans: ‘Do the venerable ones see this Angaka, our nephew?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, Sir, we see him.’</p>
<p>‘Well! Angaka, Sirs, is handsome, pleasant to look upon, inspiring trust, gifted with great beauty of complexion, fair in colour, fine in presence, stately to behold—none in this assembly is like unto him in colour, save only the Samaṇa Gotama.</p>
<p>‘And Angaka, Sirs, is a repeater (of the sacred words), knowing the mystic verses by heart, one who has mastered the Three Vedas, with the indices, the ritual, the phonology, and the exegesis (as a fourth), and the legends as a fifth, learned in the phrases and the grammar, versed in Lokāyata (Nature-lore), and in the theory of the signs on the body of a great man—I myself have taught him the verses.</p>
<p>‘And Angaka, Sirs, is well born on both sides, on the mother’s side and on the father’s side, of pure descent back through seven generations, with no slur put upon him, and no reproach in respect of birth—I myself know his forebears, on the mother’s side and on the father’s.</p>
<p>‘If Angaka, Sirs, should kill living things, and take what has not been given, and go the way of the adulterer, and speak lies, and drink strong drink, what then, Sirs, would his colour avail him? what the verses? what his birth?</p>
<p>‘It is in so far, Sirs, as a Brahman is virtuous, increased in virtue, gifted with virtue that has grown great; in so far as he is learned and wise, the first, or it may be the second, among those who hold out the ladle, that Brahmans would declare him, as endowed with these two qualities, to be a Brahman, to be one who could rightly say “I am a Brahman” without falling into falsehood.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs21"></a>‘But of these two things, oh Brahman, is it possible to leave one out, and to declare the man who has the other to be a Brahman, to be one who can rightly, and without falling into falsehood, claim to be a Brahman?’</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en156"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi124"></a>‘Not that, Gotama! For wisdom, oh Gotama, is purified by uprightness, and uprightness is purified by wisdom. Where there is uprightness, wisdom is there, and where there is wisdom, uprightness is there. To the upright there is wisdom, to the wise there is uprightness, and wisdom and goodness are declared to be the best thing in the world. Just, oh Gotama, as one might wash hand with hand, or foot with foot, just even so, oh Gotama, is wisdom purified by uprightness, and uprightness is purified by wisdom. Where there is uprightness, wisdom is there, and where there is wisdom, uprightness is there. To the upright, there is wisdom, to the wise there is uprightness, and wisdom and goodness are declared to be the best thing in the world.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs22"></a>‘That is just so, oh Brahman. And I, too, say the same. But what, then, is that uprightness and what that wisdom?, ‘We only know, oh Gotama, the general statement in this matter. May the venerable Gotama be pleased to explain the meaning of the phrase.’</p>
<p>‘Well then, oh Brahman, give ear, and pay earnest attention, and I will speak.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs23"></a>‘Very well, Sir,’ said Soṇadaṇḍa in assent to the Blessed One. And the Blessed One said:</p>
<p class="add">The next section in the Pali text is greatly abbreviated. The following is a fully expanded version, based on the text of DN 2, Sāmaññaphala Sutta as translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi. Note that it is not always possible to determine exactly how the expansion should be done.</p>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps41"></a>“Herein, Brahman, a Tathāgata arises in the world, a worthy one, perfectly enlightened, <span class="expanded">endowed with clear knowledge and conduct, accomplished, a knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of men to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and exalted. Having realized by his own direct knowledge this world with its gods, its Māras, and its Brahmās, this generation with its recluses and brahmins, its rulers and people, he makes it known to others. He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, possessing meaning and phrasing; he reveals the holy life that is fully complete and purified.</span></p>
<div class="expanded">
<p><a class="bps" id="bps42"></a>“A householder, or a householder’s son, or one born into some other family, hears the Dhamma. Having heard the Dhamma, he gains faith in the Tathāgata. Endowed with such faith, he reflects: ‘The household life is crowded, a path of dust. Going forth is like the open air. It is not easy for one dwelling at home to lead the perfectly complete, perfectly purified holy life, bright as a polished conch. Let me then shave off my hair and beard, put on saffron robes, and go forth from home to homelessness.’</p>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps43"></a>“After some time he abandons his accumulation of wealth, be it large or small; he abandons his circle of relatives, be it large or small; he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on saffron robes, and goes forth from home to homelessness.</p>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps44"></a>“When he has thus gone forth, he lives restrained by the restraint of the Pātimokkha, possessed of proper behaviour and resort. Having taken up the rules of training, he trains himself in them, seeing danger in the slightest faults. He comes to be endowed with wholesome bodily and verbal action, his livelihood is purified, and he is possessed of conduct. He guards the doors of his sense faculties, is endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension, and is content.</p>
<h2>The Small Section on Moral Discipline</h2>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps45"></a>“And how, Brahman, is the bhikkhu possessed of moral discipline? Herein, Brahman, having abandoned the destruction of life, the bhikkhu abstains from the destruction of life. He has laid down the rod and weapon and dwells conscientious, full of kindness, sympathetic for the welfare of all living beings. This pertains to his moral discipline.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned taking what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given. Accepting and expecting only what is given, he lives in honesty with a pure mind. This too pertains to his moral discipline.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned incelibacy, he leads the holy life of celibacy. He dwells aloof and abstains from the vulgar practice of sexual intercourse. This too pertains to his moral discipline.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned false speech, he abstains from falsehood. He speaks only the truth, he lives devoted to truth; trustworthy and reliable, he does not deceive anyone in the world. This too pertains to his moral discipline.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned slander, he abstains from slander. He does not repeat elsewhere what he has heard here in order to divide others from the people here, nor does he repeat here what he has heard elsewhere in order to divide these from the people there. Thus he is a reconciler of those who are divided and a promoter of friendships. Rejoicing, delighting, and exulting in concord, he speaks only words that are conducive to concord. This too pertains to his moral discipline.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned harsh speech, he abstains from harsh speech. He speaks only such words as are gentle, pleasing to the ear, endearing, going to the heart, polite, amiable and agreeable to the manyfolk. This too pertains to his moral discipline.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned idle chatter, he abstains from idle chatter. He speaks at the right time, speaks what is factual and beneficial, speaks on the Dhamma and the Discipline. His words are worth treasuring; they are timely, backed by reasons, measured, and connected with the good. This too pertains to his moral discipline.</p>
<p>“He abstains from damaging seed and plant life.</p>
<p>“He eats only in one part of the day, refraining from food at night and from eating at improper times.</p>
<p>“He abstains from dancing, singing, instrumental music, and from witnessing unsuitable shows.</p>
<p>“He abstains from wearing garlands, embellishing himself with scents, and beautifying himself with unguents.</p>
<p>“He abstains from high and luxurious beds and seats.</p>
<p>“He abstains from accepting gold and silver.</p>
<p>“He abstains from accepting uncooked grain, raw meat, women and girls, male and female slaves, goats and sheep, fowl and swine, elephants, cattle, horses and mares.</p>
<p>“He abstains from accepting fields and lands.</p>
<p>“He abstains from running messages and errands.</p>

<p><a class="bps" id="bps64"></a><span class="expanded">“And how, Brahman, does the bhikkhu guard the doors of his sense faculties? Herein, Brahman, having seen a form with the eye, the bhikkhu does not grasp at the sign or the details.

<div class="expanded">
<p>Having heard a sound with the ear the bhikkhu does not grasp at the sign or the details. Since, if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the ear, evil unwholesome states such as covetousness and grief might assail him, he practises restraint, guards the faculty of the ear, and achieves restraint over the faculty of the ear.</p>
<p>Having smelled an odour with the nose the bhikkhu does not grasp at the sign or the details. Since, if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the nose, evil unwholesome states such as covetousness and grief might assail him, he practises restraint, guards the faculty of the nose, and achieves restraint over the faculty of the nose.</p>
<p>Having tasted a flavour with the tongue the bhikkhu does not grasp at the sign or the details. Since, if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the tongue, evil unwholesome states such as covetousness and grief might assail him, he practises restraint, guards the faculty of the tongue, and achieves restraint over the faculty of the tongue.</p>
<p>Having touched a tangible object with the body the bhikkhu does not grasp at the sign or the details. Since, if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the body, evil unwholesome states such as covetousness and grief might assail him, he practises restraint, guards the faculty of the body, and achieves restraint over the faculty of the body.</p>
<p>Having cognized a mind-object with the mind, the bhikkhu does not grasp at the sign or the details. Since, if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the mind, evil unwholesome states such as covetousness and grief might assail him, he practises restraint, guards the faculty of the mind, and achieves restraint over the faculty of the mind. Endowed with this noble restraint of the sense faculties, he experiences within himself an unblemished happiness. In this way, Brahman, the bhikkhu guards the doors of the sense faculties.</p>
<h2>Mindfulness and Clear Comprehension</h2>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps65"></a>“And how, Brahman, is the bhikkhu endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension? Herein, Brahman, in going forward and returning, the bhikkhu acts with clear comprehension. In looking ahead and looking aside, he acts with clear comprehension. In bending and stretching the limbs, he acts with clear comprehension. In wearing his robes and cloak and using his alms-bowl, he acts with clear comprehension. In eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting, he acts with clear comprehension. In defecating and urinating, he acts with clear comprehension. In going, standing, sitting, lying down, waking up, speaking, and remaining silent, he acts with clear comprehension. In this way, Brahman, the bhikkhu is endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension.</p>
<h2>Contentment</h2>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps66"></a>“And how, Brahman, is the bhikkhu content? Herein, Brahman, a bhikkhu is content with robes to protect his body and almsfood to sustain his belly; wherever he goes he sets out taking only (his requisites) along with him. Just as a bird, wherever it goes, flies with its wings as its only burden, in the same way a bhikkhu is content with robes to protect his body and almsfood to sustain his belly; wherever he goes he sets out taking only (his requisites) along with him. In this way, Brahman, the bhikkhu is content.</p>
<h2>The Abandoning of the Hindrances</h2>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps67"></a>“Endowed with this noble aggregate of moral discipline, this noble restraint over the sense faculties, this noble mindfulness and clear comprehension, and this noble contentment, he resorts to a secluded dwelling—a forest, the foot of a tree, a mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a cremation ground, a jungle grove, the open air, a heap of straw. After returning from his alms-round, following his meals, he sits down, crosses his legs, holds his body erect, and sets up mindfulness before him.</p>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps68"></a>“Having abandoned covetousness for the world, he dwells with a mind free from covetousness; he purifies his mind from covetousness. Having abandoned ill will and hatred, he dwells with a benevolent mind, sympathetic for the welfare of all living beings; he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Having abandoned dullness and drowsiness, he dwells perceiving light, mindful and clearly comprehending; he purifies his mind from dullness and drowsiness. Having abandoned restlessness and worry, he dwells at ease within himself, with a peaceful mind; he purifies his mind from restlessness and worry. Having abandoned doubt, he dwells as one who has passed beyond doubt, unperplexed about wholesome states; he purifies his mind from doubt.</p>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps69"></a>“Brahman, suppose a man were to take a loan and apply it to his business, and his business were to succeed, so that he could pay back his old debts and would have enough money left over to maintain a wife. He would reflect on this, and as a result he would become glad and experience joy.</p>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps70"></a>“Again, Brahman, suppose a man were to become sick, afflicted, gravely ill, so that he could not enjoy his food and his strength would decline. After some time he would recover from that illness and would enjoy his food and regain his bodily strength. He would reflect on this, and as a result he would become glad and experience joy.</p>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps71"></a>“Again, Brahman, suppose a man were locked up in a prison. After some time he would be released from prison, safe and secure, with no loss of his possessions. He would reflect on this, and as a result he would become glad and experience joy.</p>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps72"></a>“Again, Brahman, suppose a man were a slave, without independence, subservient to others, unable to go where he wants. After some time he would be released from slavery and gain his independence; he would no longer be subservient to others but a free man able to go where he wants. He would reflect on this, and as a result he would become glad and experience joy.</p>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps73"></a>“Again, Brahman, suppose a man with wealth and possessions were travelling along a desert road where food was scarce and dangers were many. After some time he would cross over the desert and arrive safely at a village which is safe and free from danger. He would reflect on this, and as a result he would become glad and experience joy.</p>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps74"></a>“In the same way, Brahman, when a bhikkhu sees that these five hindrances are unabandoned within himself, he regards that as a debt, as a sickness, as confinement in prison, as slavery, as a desert road.</p>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps75"></a>“But when he sees that these five hindrances have been abandoned within himself, he regards that as freedom from debt, as good health, as release from prison, as freedom from slavery, as a place of safety.</p>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps76"></a>“When he sees that these five hindrances have been abandoned within himself, gladness arises. When he is gladdened, rapture arises. When his mind is filled with rapture, his body becomes tranquil; tranquil in body, he experiences happiness; being happy, his mind becomes concentrated.</p>

<p><span class="expanded"><a class="bps" id="bps85"></a>“When his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady and attained to imperturbability,</span> he directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision. <span class="expanded">He understands thus: ‘This is my body, having material form, composed of the four primary elements, originating from father and mother, built up out of rice and gruel, impermanent, subject to rubbing and pressing, to dissolution and dispersion. And this is my consciousness, supported by it and bound up with it.’</span></p>
<div class="expanded">
<p><a class="bps" id="bps86"></a>“Brahman, suppose there were a beautiful beryl gem of purest water, eight-faceted, well cut, clear, limpid, flawless, endowed with all excellent qualities. And through it there would run a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread. A man with keen sight, taking it in his hand, would reflect upon it thus: ‘This is a beautiful beryl gem of purest water, eight faceted, well cut, clear, limpid, flawless, endowed with all excellent qualities. And running through it there is this blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread.’ In the same way, Brahman, when his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady and attained to imperturbability the bhikkhu directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision and understands thus: ‘This is my body, having material form, composed of the four primary elements, originating from father and mother, built up out of rice and gruel, impermanent, subject to rubbing and pressing, to dissolution and dispersion. And this is my consciousness, supported by it and bound up with it.’ This, too, Brahman, pertains to his wisdom.</p>
<h2>The Knowledge of the Mind-made Body</h2>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps87"></a>“When his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body he creates another body having material form, mind-made, complete in all its parts, not lacking any faculties.</p>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps88"></a>“Brahman, suppose a man were to draw out a reed from its sheath. He would think: ‘This is the reed; this is the sheath. The reed is one thing, the sheath another, but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath.’ Or suppose a man were to draw a sword out from its scabbard. He would think: ‘This is the sword; this is the scabbard. The sword is one thing, the scabbard another, but the sword has been drawn out from the scabbard.’ Or suppose a man were to pull a snake out from its slough. He would think: ‘This is the snake; this is the slough. The snake is one thing, the slough another, but the snake has been pulled out from the slough.’ In the same way, Brahman, his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body he creates another body having material form, mind-made, complete in all its parts, not lacking any faculties. This too, Brahman, pertains to his wisdom.</p>
<h2>The Knowledge of the Modes of Supernormal Power</h2>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps89"></a>“When his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the modes of supernormal power. He exercises the various modes of supernormal power: having been one, he becomes many and having been many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space; he dives in and out of the earth as if it were water; he walks on water without sinking as if it were earth; sitting cross-legged he travels through space like a winged bird; with his hand he touches and strokes the sun and the moon, so mighty and powerful; he exercises mastery over the body as far as the Brahma-world.</p>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps90"></a>“Brahman, suppose a skilled potter or his apprentice were to make and fashion out of well-prepared clay whatever kind of vessel he might desire. Or suppose a skilled ivory-worker or his apprentice were to make and fashion out of well-prepared ivory whatever kind of ivory work he might desire. Or suppose a skilled goldsmith or his apprentice were to make and fashion out of well-prepared gold whatever kind of gold work he might desire. In the same way, Brahman, when his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the modes of supernormal power. He exercises the various modes of supernormal power: having been one, he becomes many and having been many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space; he dives in and out of the earth as if it were water; he walks on water without sinking as if it were earth; sitting cross-legged he travels through space like a winged bird; with his hand he touches and strokes the sun and the moon, so mighty and powerful; he exercises mastery over the body as far as the Brahma-world. This too, Brahman, pertains to his wisdom.</p>
<h2>The Knowledge of the Divine Ear</h2>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps91"></a>“When his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the divine ear-element. With the divine ear-element, which is purified and surpasses the human, he hears both kinds of sound, the divine and the human, those which are distant and those which are near.</p>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps92"></a>“Brahman, suppose a man travelling along a highway were to hear the sounds of kettledrums, tambours, horns, cymbals and tom-toms, and would think: ‘This is the sound of kettledrums, this is the sound of tambours, this the sound of horns, cymbals and tom-toms.’ In the same way, Brahman, when his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the divine ear-element. With the divine ear-element, which is purified and surpasses the human, he hears both kinds of sound, the divine and the human, those which are distant and those which are near. This too, Brahman, pertains to his wisdom.</p>
<h2>The Knowledge Encompassing the Minds of Others</h2>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps93"></a>“When his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the knowledge of encompassing the minds (of others). He understands the minds of other beings and persons, having encompassed them with his own mind. He understands a mind with lust as a mind with lust and a mind without lust as a mind without lust; he understands a mind with hatred as a mind with hatred and a mind without hatred as a mind without hatred; he understands a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion; he understands a contracted mind as a contracted mind and a distracted mind as a distracted mind; he understands an exalted mind as an exalted mind and an unexalted mind as an unexalted mind; he understands a surpassable mind as a surpassable mind and an unsurpassable mind as an unsurpassable mind; he understands a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind; he understands a liberated mind as a liberated mind and an unliberated mind as an unliberated mind.</p>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps94"></a>“Brahman, suppose a young man or woman, fond of ornaments, examining his or her own facial reflection in a pure bright mirror or in a bowl of clear water, would know, if there were a mole, ‘It has a mole,’ and if there were no mole, ‘It has no mole.’ In the same way, Brahman, when his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the knowledge of encompassing the minds (of others). He understands the minds of other beings and persons, having encompassed them with his own mind. He understands a mind with lust as a mind with lust and a mind without lust as a mind without lust; he understands a mind with hatred as a mind with hatred and a mind without hatred as a mind without hatred; he understands a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion; he understands a contracted mind as a contracted mind and a distracted mind as a distracted mind; he understands an exalted mind as an exalted mind and an unexalted mind as an unexalted mind; he understands a surpassable mind as a surpassable mind and an unsurpassable mind as an unsurpassable mind; he understands a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind; he understands a liberated mind as a liberated mind and an unliberated mind as an unliberated mind. This too, Brahman, pertains to his wisdom.</p>
<h2>The Knowledge of Recollecting Past Lives</h2>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps95"></a>“When his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the knowledge of recollecting past lives. He recollects his numerous past lives, that is, one birth, two births, three, four, or five births; ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty births; a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births; many aeons of world contraction, many aeons of world expansion, many aeons of world contraction and expansion, (recollecting): ‘There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my span of life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my span of life. Passing away from that state I re-arose here.’ Thus he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their details.</p>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps96"></a>“Brahman, suppose a man were to go from his own village to another village, then from that village to still another village, and then from that village he would return to his own village. He would think to himself: ‘I went from my own village to that village. There I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, spoke in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I went to still another village. There too I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, spoke in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I returned to my own village.’ In the same way, Brahman, when his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the knowledge of recollecting past lives. He recollects his numerous past lives, that is, one birth, two births, three, four, or five births; ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty births; a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births; many aeons of world contraction, many aeons of world expansion, many aeons of world contraction and expansion, (recollecting): ‘There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my span of life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my span of life. Passing away from that state I re-arose here.’ Thus he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their details. This too, Brahman, pertains to his wisdom.</p>
<h2>The Knowledge of the Divine Eye</h2>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps97"></a>“When his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings. With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate—and he understands how beings fare according to their kamma, thus: ‘These beings—who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views, and undertook actions governed by wrong views—with the breakup of the body, after death, have reappeared in the plane of misery, the bad destinations, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings—who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, held right views, and undertook actions governed by right views—with the breakup of the body, after death, have reappeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.’ Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate—and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="expanded"><a class="bps" id="bps98"></a>“Brahman, suppose in a central square there were a building with an upper terrace, and a man with keen sight standing there were to see people entering a house, leaving it, walking along the streets, and sitting in the central square. He would think to himself: ‘Those people are entering the house, those are leaving it, those are walking along the streets, and those are sitting in the central square.’ In the same way, Brahman, when his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings. With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate—and he understands how beings fare according to their kamma, thus: ‘These beings—who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views, and undertook actions governed by wrong views—with the breakup of the body, after death, have reappeared in the plane of misery, the bad destinations, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings—who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, held right views, and undertook actions governed by right views—with the breakup of the body, after death, have reappeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.’ Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate—and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma.</span> This too, Brahman, pertains to his wisdom.</p>
<h2>The Knowledge of the Destruction of the Cankers</h2>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps99"></a><span class="expanded">“When his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers. He understands as it really is: ‘This is suffering.’ He understands as it really is: ‘This is the origin of suffering.’ He understands as it really is: ‘This is the cessation of suffering.’ He understands as it really is: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’ He understands as it really is: ‘These are the cankers.’ He understands as it really is: ‘This is the origin of the cankers.’ He understands as it really is: ‘This is the cessation of the cankers.’ He understands as it really is: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of the cankers.’</span></p>
<div class="expanded">
<p>“Knowing and seeing thus, his mind is liberated from the canker of sensual desire, from the canker of existence, and from the canker of ignorance. When it is liberated, the knowledge arises: ‘It is liberated.’ He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further beyond this.’</p>
<p><a class="bps" id="bps100"></a>“Brahman, suppose in a mountain glen there were a lake with clear water, limpid and unsullied. A man with keen sight, standing on the bank, would see oyster-shells, sand and pebbles, and shoals of fish moving about and keeping still. He would think to himself: ‘This is a lake with clear water, limpid and unsullied, and there within it are oyster-shells, sand and pebbles, and shoals of fish moving about and keeping still.’</p>
<p>“In the same way, Brahman, when his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers.

<p><span class="expanded">“Knowing and seeing thus, his mind is liberated from the canker of sensual desire, from the canker of existence, and from the canker of ignorance. When it is liberated, the knowledge arises: ‘It is liberated.’ He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done,</span> there is nothing further beyond this.’</p>
<p>This too, Brahman, pertains to his wisdom. And this, Brahman, is that wisdom.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs24"></a>When he had thus spoken, Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman said to the Blessed One:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi125"></a>‘Most excellent, oh Gotama (are the words of thy mouth), most excellent! Just as if a man were to set up that which has been thrown down, or were to reveal that which has been hidden away, or were to point out the right road to him who has gone astray, or were to bring a light into the darkness so that those who had eyes could see external forms—just even so has the truth been made known to me, in many a figure, by the venerable Gotama. I, even I, betake myself to the venerable Gotama as my guide, to the truth, and to the Order. And may the venerable Gotama accept me as a disciple, as one who, from this day forth, as long as life endures, has taken him as his guide. And may the venerable Gotama grant me the favour of taking his to-morrow’s meal with me, and also the members of the Order with him.’</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One signified, by silence, his consent. And Soṇadaṇḍa, on seeing that he had done so, arose from his seat and bowed down before the Blessed <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en158"></a>One, and walking round him with his right hand towards him, departed thence. And at early dawn he made ready at his house sweet food, both hard and soft, and had the time announced to the Blessed One: ‘It is time, oh Gotama, and the meal is ready.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs25"></a>Then the Blessed One, who had dressed in the early morning, put on his outer robe, and taking his bowl with him, went with the brethren to Soṇadaṇḍa’s house, and sat down on the seat prepared for him. And Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman satisfied the Blessed One, and the brethren, with his own hand, with sweet food, both hard and soft, until they refused any more.</p>
<p>And when the Blessed One had finished his meal, and cleansed the bowl and his hands, Soṇadaṇḍa took a low seat, and sat down beside him, and said:</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs26"></a>‘If, oh Gotama, after I have entered the assembly, I should rise from my seat to bow down before the venerable Gotama, then the assembly would find fault with me. Now he with whom the assembly should find fault, his reputation would grow less; and he who should lose his reputation, his income would grow less. For that which we have to enjoy, that depends upon our reputation. If then, when I am seated in the assembly, I stretch forth my joined palms in salutation, let the venerable Gotama accept that from me as arising up from my seat. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi126"></a>And if when I am seated in the assembly I take off my turban, let the venerable Gotama accept that from me as a salutation with my head. So if, when I am in my chariot, I were to get down from the chariot to salute the venerable Gotama, the surrounders would find fault with me. If, then, when mounted on my chariot, I bend down low the staff of my goad, let the venerable Gotama accept that from me as if I had got down. And if, when mounted on my chariot, I should wave <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en159"></a>my hand, let the venerable Gotama accept that from me as if I had bowed low in salutation!’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs27"></a>Then the Blessed One instructed and roused and incited and gladdened Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman with religious discourse, and then rose from his seat and departed thence.</p>
