<h1>The Great King Of Glory</h1>
</div>


<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.1"></a>Thus have I heard. The Blessed One was once staying at Kusinārā in the Upavattana, the Sāla grove of the Mallas, between the twin Sāla trees, at the time of his death.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.2"></a>Now the venerable Ānanda went up to the place where the Blessed One was, and bowed down before him, and took his seat respectfully on one side. And when he was so seated, the venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One:</p>

<p>“Let not the Blessed One die in this little wattle and daub town, in this town in the midst of the jungle, in this branch township. For, Lord, there are other great cities, such as Campā, Rājagaha, Sāvatthi, Sāketa, Kosambi, and Benāres. Let the Blessed One die in one of them. There there are many wealthy nobles and Brāhmans and heads of houses, believers in the Tathāgata, who will pay due honour to the remains of the Tathāgata.”</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.3"></a>“Say not so, Ānanda! Say not so, Ānanda, that this is but a small wattle and daub town, a town in the midst of the jungle, a branch township. Long ago, Ānanda, there was a king, by name Mahā-Sudassana, a king of kings, a righteous man who ruled in righteousness, an anointed Kshatriya, Lord of the four quarters of the earth, conqueror, the protector of his people, possessor of the seven royal treasures. This Kusinārā, Ānanda, was the royal city of king Mahā-Sudassana, under the name of Kusāvatī, and on the east and on the west it was twelve leagues in length, and on the north and on the south it was seven leagues in breadth. That royal city Kusāvatī, Ānanda, was mighty, and prosperous, and full of people, crowded with men, and provided with all things for food. Just, Ānanda, as the royal city of the gods, Ālakamandā by name, is mighty, prosperous, and full of people, crowded with the gods, and provided with all kinds of food, so. Ānanda, was the royal city Kusāvatī mighty and prosperous, full of people, crowded with men, and provided with all kinds of food. Both by day and by night, Ānanda, the royal city Kusāvatī resounded with the ten cries; that is to say, the noise of elephants, and the noise of horses, and the noise of chariots; the sounds of the drum, of the tabor, and of the lute; the sound of singing, and the sounds of the cymbal and of the gong; and lastly, with the cry, ‘Eat, drink, and be merry!’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.4"></a>“The royal city Kusāvatī, Ānanda, was surrounded by Seven Ramparts. Of these, one rampart was of gold, and one of silver, and one of beryl, and one of crystal, and one of agate, and one of coral, and one of all kinds of gems!</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.5"></a>“To the royal city Kusāvatī, Ānanda, there were Four Gates. One gate was of gold, and one of silver, and one of jade, and one of crystal. At each gate seven pillars were fixed; in height as three times or as four times the height of a man. And one pillar was of gold, and one of silver, and one of beryl, and one of crystal, and one of agate, and one of coral, and one of all kinds of gems.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.6"></a>“The royal city Kusāvatī, Ānanda, was surrounded by Seven Rows of Palm Trees. One row was of palms of gold, and one of silver, and one of beryl, and one of crystal, and one of agate, and one of coral, and one of all kinds of gems.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.7"></a>“And the Golden Palms had trunks of gold, and leaves and fruits of silver. And the Silver Palms had trunks of silver, and leaves and fruits of gold. And the Palms of Beryl had trunks of beryl, and leaves and fruits of crystal. And the Crystal Palms had trunks of crystal, and leaves and fruits of beryl. And the Agate Palms had trunks of agate, and leaves and fruits of coral. And the Coral Palms had trunks of coral, and leaves and fruits of agate. And the Palms of every kind of Gem had trunks and leaves and fruits of every kind of gem.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.8"></a>“And when those rows of palm trees, Ānanda, were shaken by the wind, there arose a sound sweet, and pleasant, and charming, and intoxicating. Just, Ānanda, as the seven kind of instruments yield, when well played upon, to the skilful man, a sound sweet, and pleasant, and charming, and intoxicating—just so, Ānanda, when those rows of palm trees were shaken by the wind, there arose a sound sweet, and pleasant, and charming, and intoxicating.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.9"></a>“And whoever, Ānanda, in the royal city Kusāvatī were at that time gamblers, drunkards, and given to drink, they used to dance round together to the sound of those palms when shaken by the wind.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.10"></a>“The Great King of Glory, Ānanda, was the possessor of Seven Precious Things, and was gifted with Four Marvellous Powers. What are those seven?</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.11"></a>“In the first place, Ānanda, when the Great King of Glory, on the Sabbath day, on the day of the full moon, had purified himself, and had gone up into the upper story of his palace to keep the sacred day, there then appeared to him the heavenly Treasure of the Wheel, with its nave, its tire, and all its thousand spokes complete.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.12"></a>“When he beheld it the Great King of Glory thought: ‘This saying have I heard, “When a king of the warrior race, an anointed king, has purified himself on the Sabbath day, on the day of the full moon, and has gone up into the upper story of his palace to keep the sacred day; if there appear to him the heavenly Treasure of the Wheel, with its nave, its tire, and all its thousand spokes complete-that king becomes a king of kings invincible.” May I, then, become a king of kings invincible.’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.13"></a>“Then, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory rose from his seat, and reverently uncovering from one shoulder his robe, he held in his left hand a pitcher, and with his right hand he sprinkled water up over the Wheel, as he said: ‘Roll onward, O my Lord, the Wheel! O my Lord, go forth and overcome!’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.14"></a>“Then the wondrous Wheel, Ānanda, rolled onwards towards the region of the East, and after it went the Great King of Glory, and with him his army, horses, and chariots, and elephants, and men. And in whatever place, Ānanda, the Wheel stopped, there the Great King of Glory took up his abode, and with him his army, horses, and chariots, and elephants, and men.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.15"></a>“Then, Ānanda, all the rival kings in the region of the East came to the Great King of Glory and said: ‘Come, O mighty king! Welcome, O mighty king! All is thine, O mighty king! Do thou, O mighty king, be a Teacher to us!’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.16"></a>“Thus spake the Great King of Glory: ‘Ye shall slay no living thing. Ye shall not take that which has not been given. Ye shall not act wrongly touching the bodily desires. Ye shall speak no lie. Ye shall drink no maddening drink. Ye shall eat as ye have eaten.’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.17"></a>“Then, Ānanda, all the rival kings in the region of the East became subject unto the Great King of Glory.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.18"></a>“But the wondrous Wheel, Ānanda, having plunged down into the great waters in the East, rose up out again, and rolled onward to the region of the South [and there all happened as had happened in the region of the East. And in like manner the wondrous Wheel rolled onward to the extremest boundary of the West and of the North; and there, too, all happened as had happened in the region of the East].</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.19"></a>“Now when the wondrous Wheel, Ānanda, had gone forth conquering and to conquer o’er the whole earth to its very ocean boundary, it returned back again to the royal city of Kusāvatī and remained fixed on the open terrace in front of the entrance to the inner apartments of the Great King of Glory, as a glorious adornment to the inner apartments of the Great King of Glory.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.20"></a>“Such, Ānanda, was the wondrous Wheel which appeared to the Great King of Glory.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.21"></a>“Now further, Ānanda, there appeared to the Great King of Glory the Elephant Treasure, all white, sevenfold firm, wonderful in power, flying through the sky—the Elephant-King, whose name was ‘The Changes of the Moon.’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.22"></a>“When he beheld it the Great King of Glory was pleased at heart at the thought ‘Auspicious were it to ride upon that Elephant, if only it would submit to be controlled!’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.23"></a>“Then, Ānanda, the wondrous Elephant—like a fine elephant of noble blood long since well trained—submitted to control.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.24"></a>“When as before, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory, to test that wondrous Elephant, mounted on to it early in the morning, it passed over along the broad earth to its very ocean boundary, and then returned again, in time for the morning meal, to the royal city of Kusāvatī.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.25"></a>“Such, Ānanda, was the wondrous Elephant that appeared to the Great King of Glory.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.26"></a>“Now further, Ānanda, there appeared to the Great King of Glory the Horse Treasure, all white with a black head, and a dark mane, wonderful in power, flying through the sky—the Charger-King, whose name was ‘Thunder-cloud.’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.27"></a>“When he beheld it, the Great King of Glory was pleased at heart at the thought: ‘Auspicious were it to ride upon that Horse if only it would submit to be controlled!’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.28"></a>“Then, Ānanda. the wondrous Horse—like a fine horse of the best blood long since well trained—submitted to control.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.29"></a>“When as before, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory, to test that wondrous Horse, mounted on to it early in the morning, it passed over along the broad earth to its very ocean boundary, and then returned again, in time for the morning meal, to the royal city of Kusāvatī.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.30"></a>“Such, Ānanda, was the wondrous Horse that appeared to the Great King of Glory.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.31"></a>“Now further, Ānanda, there appeared to the Great King of Glory the Gem-Treasure. That Gem was the Veluriya, bright, of the finest species, with eight facets, excellently wrought, clear, transparent, perfect in every way.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.32"></a>“The splendour, Ānanda, of that wondrous Gem spread round about a league on every side.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.33"></a>“When as before, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory, to test that wondrous Gem, set all his fourfold army in array and raised aloft the Gem upon his standard top, he was able to march out in the gloom and darkness of the night.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.34"></a>“And then too, Ānanda, all the dwellers in the villages, round about, set about their daily work, thinking, ‘The daylight hath appeared.’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.35"></a>“Such, Ānanda, was the wondrous Gem that appeared to the Great King of Glory.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.36"></a>“Now further, Ānanda, there appeared to the Great King of Glory the Woman-Treasure, graceful in figure, beautiful in appearance, charming in manner, and of the most fine complexion; neither very tall, nor very short; neither very stout, nor very slim; neither very dark, nor very fair; surpassing human beauty, she had attained unto the beauty of the gods.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.37"></a>“The touch too, Ānanda, of the skin of that wondrous Woman was as the touch of cotton or of cotton wool: in the cold her limbs were warm, in the heat her limbs were cool; while from her body was wafted the perfume of sandal wood and from her mouth the perfume of the lotus.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.38"></a>“That Pearl among Women too, Ānanda, used to rise up before the Great King of Glory, and after him retire to rest; pleasant was she in speech, and ever on the watch to hear what she might do in order so to act as to give him pleasure.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.39"></a>“That Pearl among Women too, Ānanda, was never, even in thought, unfaithful to the Great King of Glory—how much less then could she be so with the body!</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.40"></a>“Such, Ānanda, was the Pearl among Women who appeared to the Great King of Glory.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.41"></a>“Now further, Ānanda, there appeared unto the Great King of Glory a Wonderful Treasurer, possessed, through good deeds done in a former birth, of a marvellous power of vision by which he could discover treasure, whether it had an owner or whether it had not.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.42"></a>“He went up to the Great King of Glory, and said: “‘Do thou, O king, take thine case! I will deal with thy wealth even as wealth should be dealt with.’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.43"></a>“Then, as before, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory, to test that wonderful Treasurer, went on board a boat, and had it pushed out into the current in the midst of the river Ganges. Then he said to the wonderful steward: ‘I have need, O Treasurer, of yellow gold!’ ‘Let the ship then, O Great King, go alongside either of the banks.’ ‘It is here, O Treasurer, that I have need of yellow gold.’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.44"></a>“Then the wonderful Treasurer reached down to the water with both his hands, and drew up a jar full of yellow gold, and said to the Great King of Glory—‘Is that enough, O Great King? Have I done enough, O Great King?’ And the Great King of Glory replied: ‘It is enough, O Treasurer. You have done enough, O Treasurer. You have offered me enough, O Treasurer!’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.45"></a>“Such was the wonderful Treasurer, Ānanda, who appeared to the Great King of Glory. Now further, Ānanda, there appeared to the Great King of Glory a Wonderful Adviser, learned, clever, and wise; and qualified to lead the Great King of Glory to undertake what he ought to undertake, and to leave undone what he ought to leave undone.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.46"></a>“He went up to the Great King of Glory, and said: ‘Do thou, O King, take thine ease! I will be thy guide.’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.47"></a>“Such, Ānanda, was the wonderful Adviser who appeared to the Great King of Glory. The Great King of Glory was possessed of these Seven Precious Things.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.48"></a>“Now further, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory was gifted with Four Marvellous Gifts. What are the Four Marvellous Gifts?”</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.49"></a>“In the first place, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory was graceful in figure, handsome in appearance, pleasing in manner, and of most beautiful complexion, beyond what other men are. The Great King of Glory, Ānanda, was endowed with this First Marvellous Gift.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.50"></a>“And besides that, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory was of long life, and of many years, beyond those of other men. The Great King of Glory, Ānanda, was endowed with this Second Marvellous Gift.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.51"></a>“And besides that, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory was free from disease, and free from bodily suffering; and his internal fire was neither too hot nor too cold, but such as to promote good digestion, beyond that of other men. The Great King of Glory, Ānanda, was endowed with this Third Marvellous Gift.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.52"></a>“And besides that, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory was beloved and popular with Brāhmans and with laymen alike. Just, Ānanda, as a father is near and dear to his own sons, just so, Ānanda, was the Great King of Glory beloved and popular with Brāhmans and with laymen alike. And just, Ānanda, as his sons are near and dear to a father, just so, Ānanda, were Brāhmans and laymen alike near and dear to the Great King of Glory.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.53"></a>“Once, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory marched out with all his fourfold army to the pleasure ground. There, Ānanda, the Brāhmans and laymen went up to the Great King of Glory, and said: “‘O King, pass slowly by, that we may look upon thee for a longer time!’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.54"></a>“But the Great King of Glory, Ānanda, addressed his charioteer, and said: ‘Drive on the chariot slowly, charioteer, that I may look upon my people (Brāhmans and laymen) for a longer time!’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.55"></a>“This was the Fourth Marvellous Gift, Ānanda, with which the Great King of Glory was endowed.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.56"></a>“These are the Four Marvellous Gifts, Ānanda, with which the Great King of Glory was endowed.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.57"></a>“Now to the Great King of Glory, Ānanda, there occurred the thought: ‘Suppose, now, I were to make Lotus-ponds in the spaces between these palms, at every hundred bow lengths.’ Then, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory, in the spaces between those palms, at distances of a hundred bow lengths, made Lotus-ponds.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.58"></a>“And those Lotus-ponds, Ānanda, were faced with tiles of four kinds. One kind of tile was of gold, and one of silver, and one of beryl, and one of crystal.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.59"></a>“And to each of those Lotus-ponds, Ānanda, there were four flights of steps, of four different kinds. One flight of steps was of gold, and one of silver, and one of beryl, and one of crystal. The flight of golden steps had balustrades of gold, with the cross bars and the figure head of silver. The flight of silver steps had balustrades of silver, with the cross bars and the figure head of gold. The flight of beryl steps had balustrades of beryl, with the cross bars and the figure head of crystal. The flight of crystal steps had balustrades of crystal, with cross bars and figure head of beryl.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.60"></a>“And round those Lotus-ponds there ran, Ānanda, a double railing. One railing was of gold, and one was of silver. The golden railing had its posts of gold, and its cross bars and its capitals of silver. The silver railing had its posts of silver, and its cross bars and its capitals of gold.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.61"></a>“Now, to the Great King of Glory, Ānanda, there occurred the thought: ‘Suppose, now, I were to have flowers of every season planted in those Lotus-ponds for the use of all the people-to wit, blue water lilies and blue lotuses, white lotuses and white water lilies.’ Then, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory had flowers of every season planted in those Lotus-ponds for the use of all the people-to wit, blue water lilies and blue lotuses, white lotuses and white water lilies.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.62"></a>“Now, to the Great King of Glory, Ānanda, occurred the thought: ‘Suppose, now, I were to place bathing-men on the banks of those Lotus-ponds, to bathe such of the people as come there from time to time.’ Then, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory placed bathing-men on the banks of those Lotus-ponds, to bathe such of the people as come there from time to time.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.63"></a>“Now, to the Great King of Glory, Ānanda, occurred the thought: ‘Suppose, now, I were to establish a perpetual grant by the banks of those Lotus-ponds—to wit, food for the hungry, drink for the thirsty, raiment for the naked, means of conveyance for those who have need of it, couches for the tired, wives for those who want wives, gold for the poor, and money for those who are in want.’ Then, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory established a perpetual grant by the banks of those Lotus-ponds—to wit, food for the hungry, drink for the thirsty, raiment for the naked, means of conveyance for those who needed it, couches for the tired, wives for those who wanted wives, gold for the poor, and money for those who were in want.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.64"></a>“Now, Ānanda, the people (Brāhmans and laymen) went to the Great King of Glory, taking with them much wealth. And they said: ‘This abundant wealth, O King, have we brought here for the use of the King of Kings. Let the King accept it of us!’ ‘I have enough wealth, my friends, laid up for myself, the produce of righteous taxation. Do you keep this, and take away more with you!’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.65"></a>“When those men were thus refused by the King they went aside and considered together, saying: ‘It would not beseem us now, were we to take back this wealth to our own houses. Suppose, now, we were to build a mansion for the Great King of Glory.’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.66"></a>“Then they went to the Great King of Glory, and said: ‘A mansion would we build for thee, O King!"”</p>

<p>"Then, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory signified, by silence, his consent.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.67"></a>“Then Sakka, ruler of the gods, knowing in his mind the heart of the Great King of Glory, he addressed Vissakamma the god, and said: ‘Come now, Vissakamma, create me a mansion for the Great King of Glory—a palace which shall be called “Righteousness.”’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.68"></a>“‘Even so, Lord!’ said Vissakamma, in assent, Ānanda, to Sakka, the king of the gods. And as instantaneously as a strong man might stretch forth his folded arm, or draw in his arm again when it was stretched forth, so quickly did he vanish from the heaven of the Great Thirty-Three, and appeared before the Great King of Glory.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.69"></a>“Then, Ānanda, Vissakamma the god said to the Great King of Glory: ‘I would create for thee, O King, a mansion—a palace which shall be called “Righteousness!”’ Then, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory signified, by silence, his consent.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.70"></a>“So Vissakamma the god, Ānanda, created for the Great King of Glory a mansion—a palace to be called ‘Righteousness.’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.71"></a>“The Palace of Righteousness, Ānanda, was on the east and on the west a league in length, and on the north and on the south half a league in breadth.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.72"></a>“The ground-floor, Ānanda, of the Palace of Righteousness, in height as three times the height to which a man can reach, was built of bricks, of four kinds. One kind of brick was of gold, and one of silver, and one of beryl, and one of crystal.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.73"></a>“To the Palace of Righteousness, Ānanda, there were eighty-four thousand pillars of four kinds. One kind of pillar was of gold, and one of silver, and one of beryl, and one of crystal.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.74"></a>“The Palace of Righteousness, Ānanda, was fitted up with seats of four kinds. One kind of seat was of gold, and one of silver, and one of beryl, and one of crystal.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.75"></a>“In the Palace of Righteousness, Ānanda, there were twenty-four staircases of four kinds. One staircase was of gold, and one of silver, and one of beryl, and one of crystal. The staircase of gold had balustrades of gold, with the cross bars and the figure-head of silver. The staircase of silver had balustrades of silver, with the cross bars and the figure-head of gold. The staircase of beryl had balustrades of beryl, with the cross bars and the figure-head of crystal. The staircase of crystal had balustrades of crystal, with cross bars and figure-head of beryl.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.76"></a>“In the Palace of Righteousness, Ānanda, there were eighty-four thousand chambers of four kinds. One kind of chamber was of gold, and one of silver, and one of beryl, and one of crystal.</p>

<p>“In the golden chamber a silver couch was spread; in the silver chamber a golden couch; in the beryl chamber a couch of ivory; and in the crystal chamber a couch of coral.</p>

<p>“At the door of the golden chamber there stood a palm tree of silver; and its trunk was of silver, and its leaves and fruits of gold.</p>

<p>“At the door of the silver chamber there stood a palm tree of gold; and its trunk was of gold, and its leaves and fruits of silver.</p>

<p>“At the door of the beryl chamber there stood a palm tree of crystal; and its trunk was of crystal, and its leaves and fruits of beryl.</p>

<p>“At the door of the crystal chamber there stood a palm tree of beryl; and its trunk was of beryl, and its leaves and fruits of crystal.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.77"></a>“Now there occurred, Ānanda, to the Great King of Glory this thought: ‘Suppose, now, I were to make a grove of palm trees, all of gold, at the entrance to the chamber of the Great Complex, under the shade of which I may pass the heat of the day.’</p>

<p>“Then, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory made a grove of palm trees, all of gold, at the entrance to the chamber of the Great Complex, under the shade of which he might pass the heat of the day.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.78"></a>“The Palace of Righteousness, Ānanda, was surrounded by a double railing. One railing was of gold, and one was of silver. The golden railing had its posts of gold, and its cross bars and its figure head of silver. The silver railing had its posts of silver, and its cross bars and its figure head of gold.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.79"></a>“The Palace of Righteousness, Ānanda, was hung round with two networks of bells. One network of bells was of gold, and one was of silver.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.80"></a>“And when those networks of bells, Ānanda, were shaken by the wind there arose a sound sweet, and pleasant, and charming, and intoxicating. Just, Ānanda, as the seven kind of instruments yield, when well played upon, to the skilful man, a sound sweet, and pleasant, and charming, and intoxicating—just even so, Ānanda, when those networks of bells were shaken by the wind, there arose a sound sweet, and pleasant, and charming, and intoxicating.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.81"></a>“And whoever, Ānanda, in the royal city Kusāvatī were at that time gamblers, drunkards, and given to drink, they used to dance round together to the sound of those networks of bells when shaken by the wind.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.82"></a>“When the Palace of Righteousness, Ānanda, was finished it was hard to look at, destructive to the eyes. Just, Ānanda, as in the last month of the rains in the autumn time, when the sky has become clear and the clouds have vanished away, the sun, springing up along the heavens, is hard to look at, and destructive to the eyes—just so, Ānanda, when the Palace of Righteousness was finished was it hard to look at, and destructive to the eyes.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.83"></a>“Now there occurred, Ānanda, to the Great King of Glory this thought: ‘Suppose, now, in front of the Palace of Righteousness, I were to make a Lotus-lake to bear the name of “Righteousness.”’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.84"></a>“Then, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory made a Lotus-lake to bear the name of ‘Righteousness.’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.85"></a>“The Lake of Righteousness, Ānanda, was on the east and on the west a league in length, and on the north and on the south half a league in breadth. The Lake of Righteousness, Ānanda, was faced with tiles of four kinds. One kind of tile was of gold, and one of silver, and one of beryl, and one of crystal.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.86"></a>“The Lake of Righteousness, Ānanda, had four and twenty flights of steps, of four different kinds. One flight of steps was of gold, and one of silver, and one of beryl, and one of crystal. The flight of golden steps had balustrades of gold, with the cross bars and the figure-head of silver. The flight of silver steps had balustrades of silver, with the cross bars and the figure-head of gold. The flight of beryl steps had balustrades of beryl, with the cross bars and the figure-head of crystal. The flight of crystal steps had balustrades of crystal, with cross bars and figure-head of beryl.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.87"></a>“Round the Lake of Righteousness, Ānanda, there ran a double railing. One railing was of gold, and one was of silver. The golden railing had its posts of gold, and its cross bars and its capitals of silver. The silver railing had its posts of silver, and its cross bars and its capitals of gold.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.88"></a>“The Lake of Righteousness, Ānanda, was surrounded by seven rows of palm trees. One row was of palms of gold, and one of silver, and one of beryl, and one of crystal, and one of agate, and one of coral, and one of all kinds of gems.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.89"></a>“And the golden palms had trunks of gold, and leaves and fruits of silver. And the silver palms had trunks of silver, and leaves and fruits of gold. And the palms of beryl had trunks of beryl, and leaves and fruits of crystal. And the crystal palms had trunks of crystal, and leaves and fruits of beryl. And the agate palms had trunks of agate, and leaves and fruits of coral. And the coral palms had trunks of coral, and leaves and fruits of agate. And the palms of every kind of gem had trunks and leaves and fruits of every kind of gem.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.90"></a>“And when those rows of palm trees, Ānanda, were shaken by the wind, there arose a sound sweet, and pleasant, and charming, and intoxicating.</p>

<p>“Just, Ānanda, as the seven kind of instruments yield, when well played upon, to the skilful man, a sound sweet, and pleasant, and charming, and intoxicating—just so, Ānanda, when those rows of palm trees were shaken by the wind, there arose a sound sweet, and pleasant, and charming, and intoxicating.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.91"></a>“And whoever, Ānanda, in the royal city Kusāvatī were at that time gamblers, drunkards, and given to drink, they used to dance round together to the sound of those palms when shaken by the wind.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.92"></a>“When the Palace of Righteousness, Ānanda, was finished, and the Lotus-lake of Righteousness was finished, the Great King of Glory entertained with all good things those of the Samaṇas who, at that time, were held in high esteem, and those of the Brāhmans who, at that time, were held in high esteem. Then he ascended up into the Palace of Righteousness.”</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.1"></a>“Now there occurred, Ānanda, this thought to the Great King of Glory: ‘Of what previous character, now, may this be the fruit, of what previous character the result, that I am now so mighty and so great?’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.2"></a>“And then occurred, Ānanda, to the Great King of Glory this thought: ‘Of three qualities is this the fruit, of three qualities the result, that I am now so mighty and so great—that is to say, of giving, of self-conquest, and of self-control.’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.3"></a>“Now the Great King of Glory, Ānanda, ascended up into the chamber of the Great Complex; and when he had come there he stood at the door, and there he broke out into a cry of intense emotion:</p>

<p>“‘Stay here, O thoughts of lust!  Stay here, O thoughts of ill-will!  Stay here, O thoughts of hatred!  Thus far only, O thoughts of lust!  Thus far only, O thoughts of ill-will! Thus far only, O thoughts of hatred!’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.4"></a>“And when, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory had entered the chamber of the Great Complex, and had seated himself upon the couch of gold, having put away all passion and all unrighteousness, he entered into, and remained in, the First Jhāna—a state of joy and ease, born of seclusion, full of reflection, full of investigation.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.5"></a>“By suppressing reflection and investigation, he entered into, and remained in, the Second Jhāna—a state of joy and ease, born of serenity, without reflection, without investigation, a state of elevation of mind, of internal calm.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.6"></a>“By absence of the longing after joy, he remained indifferent, conscious, self-possessed, experiencing in his body that ease which the noble ones announce, saying, ‘The man indifferent and self-possessed is well at ease,’ and thus he entered into, and remained in, the Third Jhāna.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.7"></a>“By putting away ease, by putting away pain, by the previous dying away both of gladness and of sorrow, he entered into, and remained in, the Fourth Jhāna—a state of purified self-possession and equanimity, without ease, and without pain.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.8"></a>“Then, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory went out from the chamber of the Great Complex, and entered the golden chamber and sat himself down on the silver couch. And he let his mind pervade one quarter of the world with thoughts of Love; and so the second quarter, and so the third, and so the fourth. And thus the whole wide world, above, below, around, and everywhere, did he continue to pervade with heart of Love, far-reaching, grown great, and beyond measure, free from the least trace of anger or ill-will.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.9"></a>“And he let his mind pervade one quarter of the world with thoughts of Pity; and so the second quarter, and so the third, and so the fourth. And thus the whole wide world, above, below, around, and everywhere, did he continue to pervade with heart of Pity, far-reaching, grown great, and beyond measure, free from the least trace of anger or ill-will.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.10"></a>“And he let his mind pervade one quarter of the world with thoughts of Sympathy; and so the second quarter, and so the third, and so the fourth. And thus the whole wide world, above, below, around, and everywhere, did he continue to pervade with heart of Sympathy, far-reaching, grown great, and beyond measure, free from the least trace of anger or ill-will.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.11"></a>“And he let his mind pervade one quarter of the world with thoughts of Equanimity; and so the second quarter, and so the third, and so the fourth. And thus the whole wide world, above, below, around, and everywhere, did he continue to pervade with heart of Equanimity, far-reaching, grown great, and beyond measure, free from the least trace of anger or ill-will.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.12"></a>“The Great King of Glory, Ānanda, had four and eighty thousand cities, the chief of which was the royal city of Kusāvatī:</p>

<p>“Four and eighty thousand palaces, the chief of which was the Palace of Righteousness:</p>

<p>“Four and eighty thousand chambers, the chief of which was the chamber of the Great Complex:</p>

<p>“Four and eighty thousand divans, of gold, and silver, and ivory, and sandal wood, spread with long-haired rugs, and cloths embroidered with flowers, and magnificent antelope skins; covered with lofty canopies; and provided at both ends with purple cushions:</p>

<p>“Four and eighty thousand state elephants, with trappings of gold, and gilded flags, and golden coverings of network—of which the king of elephants, called ‘the Changes of the Moon,’ was chief:</p>

<p>“Four and eighty thousand state horses, with trappings of gold, and gilded flags, and golden coverings of network—of which ‘Thunder-cloud,’ the king of horses, was the chief:</p>

<p>“Four and eighty thousand chariots, with coverings of the skins of lions, and of tigers, and of panthers—of which the chariot called ‘the Flag of Victory’ was the chief:</p>

<p>“Four and eighty thousand gems, of which the Wondrous Gem was the chief:</p>

<p>“Four and eighty thousand wives, of whom the Queen of Glory was the chief:</p>

<p>“Four and eighty thousand yeomen, of whom the Wonderful Steward was the chief:</p>

<p>“Four and eighty thousand nobles, of whom the Wonderful Adviser was the chief:</p>

<p>“Four and eighty thousand cows, with jute trappings, and horns tipped with bronze:</p>

<p>“Four and eighty thousand myriads of garments, of delicate textures, of flax, and cotton, and silk, and wool:</p>

<p>“Four and eighty thousand dishes, in which, in the evening and in the morning, rice was served.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.13"></a>“Now at that time, Ānanda, the four and eighty thousand state elephants used to come every evening and every morning to be of service to the Great King of Glory.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.14"></a>“And this thought occurred to the Great King of Glory: ‘These eighty thousand elephants come every evening and every morning to be of service to me. Now, let the elephants come, O my friend, the Great Adviser, in alternate forty thousands, once each, every alternate hundred years!’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.15"></a>“Then, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory said to the Great Adviser: ‘O, my friend, the Great Adviser! these eighty thousand elephants come every evening and every morning to be of service to me. Now, let the elephants come, O my friend, the Great Adviser, in alternate forty thousands, once each, every alternate hundred years!’ ‘Even so, Lord!’ said the Wonderful Adviser, in assent, to the Great King of Glory.’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.16"></a>“From that time forth, Ānanda, the elephants came in alternate forty thousands, once each, every alternate hundred years.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.17"></a>“Now, Ānanda, after the lapse of many years, of many hundred years, of many thousand years, there occurred to the Queen of Glory this thought:</p>

<p>“’Tis long since I have beheld the Great King of Glory. Suppose, now, I were to go and visit the Great King of Glory.’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.18"></a>“Then, Ānanda, the Queen of Glory said to the women of the harem: ‘Arise now, dress your hair, and clad yourselves in fresh raiment. Tis long since we have beheld the Great King of Glory. Let us go and visit the Great King of Glory!’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.19"></a>“‘Even so, Lady!’ said the women of the harem, Ānanda, in assent, to the Queen of Glory. And they dressed their hair, and clad themselves in fresh raiment, and came near to the Queen of Glory.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.20"></a>“Then, Ānanda, the Queen of Glory said to the Great Adviser: ‘Arrange, O Great Adviser, the fourfold army in array. ’Tis long since I have beheld the Great King of Glory. I am about to go to visit the Great King of Glory.’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.21"></a>“‘Even so, O Queen!’ said the Great Adviser, Ānanda, in assent, to the Queen of Glory. And he set the fourfold army in array, and had the fact announced to the Queen of Glory in the words:</p>

<p>“‘The fourfold army, O Queen, is set for thee in array. Do now whatever seemeth to thee fit.’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.22"></a>“Then, Ānanda, the Queen of Glory, with the fourfold army, repaired, with the women of the harem, to the Palace of Righteousness. And when she had arrived there she mounted up into the Palace of Righteousness, and went on to the chamber of the Great Complex. And when she had reached it, she stopped and leant against the side of the door.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.23"></a>“When, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory heard the noise he thought: ‘What, now, may this noise, as of a great multitude of people, mean?’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.24"></a>“And going out from the chamber of the Great Complex, he beheld the Queen of Glory standing leaning up against the side of the door. And when he beheld her, he said to the Queen of Glory: ‘Stop there, O Queen! Enter not!’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.25"></a>“Then the Great King of Glory, Ānanda, said to one of his attendants: ‘Arise, good man! take the golden couch out of the chamber of the Great Complex, and make it ready under that grove of palm trees which is all of gold.’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.26"></a>“‘Even so, Lord!’ said the man, in assent, to the Great King of Glory. And he took the golden couch out of the chamber of the Great Complex, and made it ready under that grove of palm trees which was all of gold.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.27"></a>“Then, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory laid himself down in the dignified way a lion does; and lay with one leg resting on the other, calm and self-possessed.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.28"></a>“Then, Ānanda, there occurred to the Queen of Glory this thought:</p>

<p>“‘How calm are all the limbs of the Great King of Glory! How clear and bright is his appearance! O may it not be that the Great King of Glory is dead!’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.29"></a>“And she said to the Great King of Glory:</p>

<p>“‘Thine, O King, are those four and eighty thousand cities, the chief of which is the royal city of Kusāvatī. Arise, O King, re-awaken thy desire for these! Quicken thy longing after life!</p>

<p>“‘Thine, O King, are those four and eighty thousand dishes, in which, in the evening and in the morning, rice is served. Arise, O King, re-awaken thy desire for these! Quicken thy longing after life!’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.30"></a>“When she had thus spoken, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory said to the Queen of Glory:</p>

<p>“‘Long hast thou addressed me, O Queen, in pleasant words, much to be desired, and sweet. Yet now in this last time you speak in words unpleasant, disagreeable, not to be desired.’</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.30"></a>“‘How then, O King, shall I address thee?’</p>

<p>“‘Thus, O Queen, shouldst thou address me—The nature of all things near and dear to us, O King, is such that we must leave them, divide ourselves from them, separate ourselves from them. Pass not away, O King, with longing in thy heart. Sad is the death of him who longs, unworthy is the death of him who longs.

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.32"></a>“When he thus spake, Ānanda, the Queen of Glory wept and poured forth tears. </p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.33"></a>“Then, Ānanda, the Queen of Glory wiped away her tears, and addressed the Great King of Glory, and said:</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.35"></a>“When the Great King of Glory, Ānanda, had died, he came to life again in the happy world of Brahmā.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.36"></a>“For eight and forty thousand years, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory lived the happy life of a prince; for eight and forty thousand years he was viceroy and heir-apparent; for eight and forty thousand years he ruled the kingdom; and for eight and forty thousand years he lived, as a layman, the noble life in the Palace of Righteousness. And then, when full of noble thoughts, he died; he entered, after the dissolution of the body, the noble world of Brahma.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.37"></a>“Now it may be, Ānanda, that you may think ‘The Great King of Glory of that time was another person.’ But, Ānanda, you should not view the matter thus. I at that time was the Great King of Glory.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.38"></a>“Of those four and eighty thousand cities, Ānanda, one was that city in which, at that time, I used to dwell—to wit, the royal city of Kusāvatī.</p>

<p>“Of those four and eighty thousand palaces too, Ānanda, one was that palace in which, at that time, I used to dwell—to wit, the Palace of Righteousness.</p>

<p>“Of those four and eighty thousand chambers too, Ānanda, one was that chamber in which, at that time, I used to dwell—to wit, the chamber of the Great Complex. Of those four and eighty thousand divans too, Ānanda, one was that divan which, at that time, I used to occupy—to wit, one of gold, or one of silver, or one of ivory, or one of sandal wood.</p>

<p>“Of those four and eighty thousand state elephants too, Ānanda, one was that elephant which, at that time, I used to ride—to wit, the king of elephants, ‘the Changes of the Moon.’</p>

<p>“Of those four and eighty thousand chariots too, Ānanda, one was that chariot in which, at that time, I used to ride—to wit, the chariot called ‘the Flag of Victory.’</p>

<p>“Of those four and eighty thousand wives too, Ānanda, one was that wife who, at that time, used to wait upon me—to wit, either a lady of noble birth, or a Velāmikānī.</p>

<p>“Of those four and eighty thousand myriads of suits of apparel too, Ānanda, one was the suit of apparel which, at that time, I wore—to wit, one of delicate texture, of linen, or cotton, or silk, or wool.</p>

<p>“Of those four and eighty thousand dishes too, Ānanda, one was that dish from which, at that time, I ate a measure of rice and the curry suitable thereto.</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.39"></a>“See, Ānanda, how all these things are now past, are ended, have vanished away. Thus impermanent, Ānanda, are component things; thus transitory, Ānanda, are component things; thus untrustworthy, Ānanda, are component things. Insomuch, Ānanda, is it meet to be weary of, is it meet to be estranged from, is it meet to be set quite free from the bondage of all component things!</p>

<p><a class="pts" id="pts2.40"></a>“Now I call to mind, Ānanda, how in this spot my body had been six times buried.
