<h1>The Discourse on the Great Convention</h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus I have heard</span>: at one time the Gracious One was dwelling amongst the Sakyans in the Great Wood near Kapilavatthu with a great Saṅgha of monks consisting of five hundred monks, all of them Worthy Ones, and almost all of the gods from the ten world-elements had assembled to see the Gracious One and the Saṅgha of monks.</p>
<p>Then this occurred to four gods from among the hosts in the Pure Abodes: “The Gracious One is dwelling amongst the Sakyans in the Great Wood near Kapilavatthu with a great Saṅgha of moṅks consisting of five hundred monks, all of them Worthy Ones, and almost all of the gods from the ten world elements have assembled to see the Gracious One and the Saṅgha of monks. Well now, we too could approach the Gracious One, and after approaching the Gracious One we could recite a verse each in his presence.”</p>
<p>Then those gods, just as a strong man might stretch out a bent arm, or bend in an outstretched arm, in the same way disappeared from among the gods of the Pure Abodes and appeared in front of the Gracious One. Then those gods after worshipping the Gracious One, stood on one side. While standing on one side one of the gods recited this verse in the presence of the Gracious One:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="gatha-number">1</a>“There is a great convention in the wood,<br>
and a host of gods have come,<br>
we have come to this Dhamma convention<br>
to see the Saṅgha, who are undefeated.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then another god recited this verse in the presence of the Gracious One:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="gatha-number">2</a>“In this place the monks are concentrated,<br>
they have straightened out their minds by themselves,<br>
like a charioteer who has taken the reins,<br>
the wise protect their sense faculties.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then another god recited this verse in the presence of the Gracious One:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="gatha-number">3</a>“Having cut off the hindrance and obstacle,<br>
and dug up the locking post, they are unmoved,<br>
they live pure and unstained,<br>
young nāgas, well-tamed by the Visionary.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then another god recited this verse in the presence of the Gracious One: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="gatha-number">4</a>“Whoever has gone to the Buddha for refuge<br>
will not go to the lower worlds.<br>
After giving up the human body<br>
they will fill up the ranks of the gods.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the Gracious One addressed the monks, saying: “Monks, almost all of the gods from the ten world-elements have assembled to see the Realised One and the Saṅgha of monks. Monks, those who in the past were Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas, for those Gracious Ones also at least as many gods have assembled as for me at the present time. Monks, those who in the future will be Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas, for those Gracious Ones also at least as many gods will assemble as for me at the present time.</p>
<p>Monks, I will declare the names of the hosts of gods, monks, I will proclaim the names of the hosts of gods, monks, I will reveal the names of the hosts of gods.</p>
<p>Listen to it, apply your minds well, and I will speak.” “Yes, reverend Sir,” those monks replied to the Gracious One, and the Gracious One said this:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="gatha-number">5</a>“I will repeat a famous verse <span class="supplied">(a Siloka)</span><br>
wherever the gods of the Earth live:<br>
There are <span class="supplied">monks</span> who live in a hill cave,<br>
who are resolute, composed,</p>
<p><a class="gatha-number">6</a>who are like lions crouching,<br>
who have overcome <span class="supplied">all</span> horror,<br>
with minds that are cleansed, and purified,<br>
which are clear, and undisturbed”.</p>
<p><a class="gatha-number">7</a>He knew there were more than five hundred<br>
in the wood near Kapilavatthu <span class="supplied">like this</span>,<br>
therefore the Teacher addressed<br>
those disciples who delight in the teaching:</p>
<p><a class="gatha-number">8</a>“A host of gods have drawn near <span class="supplied">to us</span>,<br>
you should know who they are, monks!”<br>
Then <span class="supplied">those monks</span> became ardent,<br>
after hearing the Buddha’s teaching,</p>
<p><a class="gatha-number">9</a>and knowledge was manifest to them,<br>
seeing those non-human beings—<br>
and some of them saw a hundred,<br>
a thousand, or seventy <span class="supplied">thousand</span>.</p>
<p><a class="gatha-number">10</a>Some of them saw a hundred thousand<br>
of those non-human beings,<br>
and some saw an endless number<br>
spread out in every direction.</p>
<p><a class="gatha-number">11</a>Having deep knowledge of all that<br>
the Visionary desired to speak,<br>
therefore the Teacher addressed<br>
those disciples who delight in the teaching:</p>
<p><a class="gatha-number">12</a>“A host of gods have drawn near <span class="supplied">to us</span>,<br>
you should know who they are, monks!<br>
I will proclaim their <span class="supplied">names</span> to you<br>
with lyrics in regular order.</p>
