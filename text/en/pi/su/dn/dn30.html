<h1>30. The Marks of the Superman</h1>
</div>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> The Exalted One was once staying near <i lang="pi" class="name">Sāvatthī</i>, in <i lang="pi" class="name">Anāthapiṇḍika’s</i> Park, the Jeta-Vana.</p>
<p>And there the Exalted One addressed the Brethren, saying Bhikkhus!</p>
<p>Yea, lord! they responded.</p>
<p>And he said: —</p>
<p>There are thirty-two special marks of the Super-man, brethren, and for the Superman possessing them two careers lie open, and none other. If he live the life of the House, he becomes Monarch, Turner of the Wheel, a righteous Lord of the Right, Ruler of the four quarters, Conqueror, Guardian of the people’s good, Owner of the Seven Treasures. His do those seven treasures become, to wit, the Wheel treasure, the Elephant treasure, the Horse treasure, the Gem treasure, the Woman treasure, the Housefather treasure, the Adviser treasure making the seventh. More than a thousand sons will be his, heroes, champions, vigorous of frame, crushers of the hosts of the enemy. He, when he has conquered this earth to its ocean bounds, is established not by the scourge, not by the sword, but by righteousness. But if such a boy go forth from the life of the House into the Homeless State, he becomes Arahant, a Buddha Supreme, rolling back the veil from the world.</p>
<p>And what, brethren, are the Thirty-two Marks of the Superman, wherewith endowed two careers lie open to him and none other:—that of a Monarch, Turner of the Wheel … that of Buddha Supreme?</p>
<p>(1) He hath feet with level tread. That this is so counts to him as one of the marks of the Superman.</p>
<p>(2) Moreover beneath, on the soles of his feet, wheels appear thousand-spoked, with tyre and hub, in every way complete and well divided. That this is so counts to him as one of the marks of the Superman.</p>
<p>(3) He has projecting heels. That this is so, <i lang="pi" class="name">etc</i>.</p>
<p>(4) He is long in the fingers and toes. …</p>
<p>(5) Soft and tender in hands and feet. …</p>
<p>(6) With hands and feet like a net. …</p>
<p>(7) His ankles are like rounded shells. …</p>
<p>(8) His legs are like an antelope’s. …</p>
<p>(9) Standing and without bending he can touch and rub his knees with either hand. …</p>
<p>(10) His male organs are concealed in a sheath. …</p>
<p>(11) His complexion is like bronze, the colour of gold. …</p>
<p>(12) His skin is so delicately smooth that no dust cleaves to his body. …</p>
<p>(13) The down on it grows in single hairs one to each pore. …</p>
<p>(14) The down on his body turns upward, every hair of it, blue black in colour like eye-paint, in little curling rings, curling to the right. …</p>
<p>(15) He has a frame divinely straight. …</p>
<p>(16) He has the seven convex surfaces. …</p>
<p>(17) The front half of his body is like a lion’s. …</p>
<p>(18) There is no furrow between his shoulders. …</p>
<p>(19) His proportions have the symmetry of the banyan-tree: the length of his body is equal to the compass of his arms, and the compass of his arms is equal to his height. …</p>
<p>(20) His bust is equally rounded. …</p>
<p>(21) His taste is supremely acute. …</p>
<p>(22) His jaws are as a lion’s. …</p>
<p>(23) He has forty teeth. …</p>
<p>(24) Regular teeth. …</p>
<p>(25) Continuous teeth. …</p>
<p>(26) The eyeteeth are very lustrous. …</p>
<p>(27) His tongue is long. …</p>
<p>(28) He has a divine voice like the karavika bird’s. …</p>
<p>(29) His eyes are intensely blue. …</p>
<p>(30) He has eyelashes like a cow’s. …</p>
<p>(31) Between the eyebrows appears a hairy mole white and like soft cotton down. …</p>
<p>(32) His head is like a royal turban. …</p>
<p>These, brethren, are the Thirty-two Marks of the Superman, wherewith endowed he has two careers that lie open to him and none other: that of the Lord of the Wheel and that of Buddha Supreme. … And seers not of our communion, brethren, are acquainted with these Marks, but they know not for what deeds done any one of the Marks is acquired.</p>
<p>Whereas in whatsoever former birth, former state of becoming, former sojourning, brethren, the <i lang="pi" class="name">Tathāgata</i>, then being human, took on mighty enterprise in all good things, took on unfaltering enterprise in seemly course of deed and word and thought:—in dispensing gifts, in virtuous undertakings, in keeping of festivals, in filial duties to mother and to father, in pious duties to recluse and brahmin, in honour to the head of the house and in other such things of lofty merit—by the doing and by the accumulating of that karma, by the mass and the abundance thereof, he when the body perished was after death reborn in a bright and blessed world. There was he endowed with a larger measure than other devas in ten matters, to wit in celestial years, beauty, happiness, glory, dominion, sights, sounds, odours, tastes and touches. Deceasing thence and attaining life as ye know it, he acquires this Mark of the Superman, to wit: feet with level tread, evenly placing his foot upon earth, evenly drawing it up, evenly touching earth with the entire surface of the foot.</p>
<p>He, endowed with this mark, if he dwell in the House, becomes Monarch, Turner of the Wheel. … Conquering not by the scourge, not by the sword, but by righteousness, he doth preside over this earth to its ocean-bounds, an earth void of barrenness, pitfalls or jungle, mighty, prosperous, secure and fortunate and without blemish. As Monarch, what doth he get? He is not liable to obstruction from any human foe with hostile intent. As Monarch this doth he get. If he leave the House for the Homeless State, he becomes Arahant, Buddha Supreme, rolling back the veil of the world. As Buddha what doth he get? He is not liable to obstruction from any foe or adversary within or without, out of lust or hate or illusion, whether recluse or brahmin or deva or <i lang="pi" class="name">Māra</i> or <i lang="pi" class="name">Brahmā</i> or anyone in all the world. As Buddha this doth he get.</p>
<p>This was the matter spoken of by the Exalted One.</p>
<p>Concerning it this was said: —</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>With heart intent on speaking truth,<br>
On righteous ways and self-restraint,<br>
Curbing of sense and conduct pure,<br>
On virtue’s hearth and holy feast,<br>
On open hand and gentle life,<br>
Harming no creature, shunning force:—<br>
So fared he ever and a day,<br>
And high resolve upon him took.<br>
He by that karma passed to heaven<br>
To share in bliss and ravishment;<br>
Thence when he fell, reborn as man,<br>
Lo! ‘twas with even-treading feet<br>
He came and touched the lap of earth.<br>
Interpreters together met<br>
Declared: No obstacle can rise<br>
For him who treads with level foot.<br>
Dwell he among the laity,<br>
Or leave the world as Wanderer,<br>
This doth that sign betoken clear.<br>
If of the House a dweller he,<br>
Unhindered shall he hold his way,<br>
By foemen; he shall overcome<br>
All others, he shall rout the foe.<br>
No human power can bid him stay,<br>
So works in him his Karma’s fruit.</p>
<p>Or if, so treading, he doth fare<br>
Forth from the world as Wanderer,<br>
With vision clear and wholly fain<br>
Worldly ambitions to forswear,<br>
Chief among men, and peerless he<br>
Never i’ faith comes back to birth.<br>
This is for him the natural law.</p>

<p>Endowed with this Mark, if he dwell in the House, he becomes Monarch, Turner of the Wheel. … As Monarch what doth he get? He hath a great retinue; many are they that surround him:—brahmin householders, townsmen and country folk, treasury officials, bodyguards, warders, ministers, courtiers, tributary kings, feudatories in chief and youths of high degree. As Monarch this doth he get. If he leave the House for the Homeless State, he becomes … Buddha Supreme. … As Buddha what doth he get?

Once did he wisely men appraise,<br>
Weighed them in judgment, criticized,<br>
Each by himself: He’s worthy that,<br>
Detecting where each one excelled.<br>
Hence can he now unbending stand,<br>
And touch the knees with both his hands.<br>
And as a tree for girth and height,<br>
The fruit of other well-wrought deeds.<br>
Experts in divers signs and marks,<br>
Versed in such lore did thus declare:<br>
Things fit for laymen of all kinds<br>
As quite a little boy he gets.<br>
Much worldly wealth for this world’s lord<br>
And fit for laymen shall be his.<br>
And if all wealth of worIdly joys<br>
He shall renounce, then doth he win<br>
Of riches highest utmost crown.</p>
