<p>At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying: “Monks.” “Revered one,” these monks answered the Lord in assent. The Lord spoke thus:</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd2"></a>“Monks, possessed of eleven qualities a cowherd cannot be one to take care of a herd of cattle and to make it prosperous. Of what eleven? Herein, monks, a cowherd is not one who is versed in material shapes, he is not skilled in (distinguishing) marks, he does not remove flies' eggs, he does not dress sores, he makes no fumigation, he does not know what is a ford, he does not know<a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en272"></a> what is a watering-place, he does not know what is a road, he is not skilled in pastures, he is one who milks dry, he pays no special respect to those bulls who are the sires and leaders of the herd. Monks, if a cowherd is possessed of these eleven qualities, he cannot be one to take care of the herd and make it prosperous.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd3"></a>Even so, monks, if a monk is possessed of eleven qualities, he cannot become one to reach growth, increase and maturity in this Dhamma and Discipline. With what eleven? Herein, monks, a monk is one who is not versed in material shapes, he is not skilled in (distinguishing) marks, he does not remove flies' eggs, he does not dress sores, he makes no fumigation, he does not know what is a ford, he does not know what is a watering-place, he does not know what is a road, he is not skilled in pastures, he is one who milks dry, he pays no special respect to those monks who are elders and have gone forth many a day and are the sires and leaders of the Order.</p>
