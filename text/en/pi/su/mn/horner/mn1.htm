</div>
<p><a class="wp" id="wp1"></a><a class="pts" id="pts1.1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard:</span></p>
<p>At one time the Lord was staying near Ukkatthā in the Subhaga Grove close to the great sāl-tree.</p>
<p>While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks.”</p>
<p>“Revered One,” these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>
<p>The Lord spoke thus:</p>
<p><a class="wp" id="wp2"></a>“I will teach you, monks, the synopsis of the fundamentals of all things. Listen, attend carefully, and I will speak.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Lord,” these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>
<p>The Lord spoke thus:</p>
<p><a class="wp" id="wp3"></a>“This in this case, monks, where an uninstructed average person, taking no count of the pure ones, unskilled in the dhamma of the pure ones, untrained in the dhamma of the pure ones, taking no count of the true men, unskilled in the dhamma of the true men, untrained in the dhamma of the true men, recognises extension as extension; having recognised extension as extension, he thinks of extension, he thinks (of self) in (regard to) extension, he thinks (of self as) extension, he thinks, ‘Extension is mine.’ He rejoices in extension.</p>

The problem with the abbreviated form here being, that it is possible for a being to think of himself [as all] beings, devas, etc., and we will never know for certain now which was intended by Ms. Horner.</span> he thinks, ‘Beings are mine.’ He rejoices in beings.</p>
