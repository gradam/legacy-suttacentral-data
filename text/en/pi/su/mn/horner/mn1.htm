<p>“Monks.”</p>
<p>“Revered One,” these monks answered the Lord in assent. The Lord spoke thus:</p>
<p><a class="wp" id="wp2"></a>“I will teach you, monks, the synopsis of the fundamentals of all things. Listen, attend carefully, and I will speak.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Lord,” these monks answered the Lord in assent. The Lord spoke thus:</p>
