<p><a class="bd" id="bd1"></a><a class="wp" id="wp1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard:</span></p>
<p>At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. There the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks.”</p>
<p>“Your reverence,” these monks answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent. Then the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus:</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd2"></a>“Your reverences, it is said: ‘Perfect view, perfect view.’ To what extent indeed, your reverences, does a disciple of the ariyans come to be of perfect view, one whose view is upright, one who is possessed of unwavering confidence in Dhamma, who is come into this true Dhamma?”</p>
<p>“From afar, your reverence, would we come into the venerable Sāriputta's presence to learn the meaning of this utterance. It were good if the meaning of this utterance were to be made clear by the venerable Sāriputta himself; the monks, having heard it from the venerable Sāriputta, will bear it in mind.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en58"></a>“Very well, your reverences, listen and attend carefully and I will speak.”</p>
<p>“Yes, your reverence,” these monks answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent. The venerable Sāriputta spoke thus:</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd3"></a>“When a disciple of the ariyans comprehends unskill and unskill's root, and comprehends skill and skill's root, to this extent, your reverences, does a disciple of the ariyans come to be of perfect view, one whose view is upright, who is possessed of unwavering confidence in Dhamma, one who has come into this true Dhamma. And what, your reverences, is unskill? What is unskill's root? What is skill? What is skill's root?</p>

<p><a class="bd" id="bd7"></a>And what, your reverences, is skill's root? Non-greed is skill's root, non-hatred is skill's root, non-confusion is skill's root. This, your reverences, is called skill's root.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd8"></a>When, your reverences, a disciple of the ariyans comprehends unskill thus, comprehends unskill's root thus, comprehends skill thus, comprehends skill's root thus, he, having got rid of all addiction to attachment, having dispelled addiction to shunning, having abolished addiction to the latent view ‘I am,’ having got rid of ignorance, having made knowledge arise, is here-now an end-maker of anguish. To this extent, your reverences, does a disciple of the ariyans come to be of perfect view, one whose view is upright, one who is possessed of unwavering confidence in Dhamma, one who has come into this true Dhamma.”</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd9"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en59"></a>Saying: “Good, your reverence,” these monks, having rejoiced in what the venerable Sāriputta had said, having approved of it, asked the venerable Sāriputta a further question: “Might there be, your reverence, also another method by which a disciple of the ariyans comes to be of perfect view, one whose view is upright, one who has unwavering confidence in Dhamma, one who has come into this true Dhamma?”</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd10"></a>“There might be, your reverences. When, your reverences, a disciple of the ariyans comprehends sustenance and comprehends the uprising of sustenance and comprehends the stopping of sustenance and comprehends the course leading to the stopping of sustenance, to this extent also, your reverences, does a disciple of the ariyans come to be of perfect view, one whose view is upright, one who has unwavering confidence in Dhamma, one who has come into this true Dhamma.</p>

Birth is anguish, and old age is anguish, and disease is anguish, and dying is anguish, and grief, lamentation, suffering, tribulation and despair are anguish; and if one does not get what one wants, that too is anguish; in short, the five groups of grasping are anguish. This, your reverences, is called anguish.</p>

That craving which is connected with again-becoming, accompanied by delight and attachment, finding delight in this and that, namely the craving for sense-pleasures, the craving for becoming, the craving for annihilation, this, your reverences, is called the origin of anguish.</p>
