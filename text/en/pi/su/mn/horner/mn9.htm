<p><a class="wp" id="wp1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard:</span></p>
<p>At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>
<p>There the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks.”</p>
<p>“Your reverence,” these monks answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent.</p>
<p>Then the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Your reverences, it is said:</p>
<p>‘Perfect view, perfect view.’</p>
<p>To what extent indeed, your reverences, does a disciple of the ariyans come to be of perfect view, one whose view is upright, one who is possessed of unwavering confidence in <i>dhamma</i>, who is come into this true <i>dhamma</i>?”</p>
<p>“From afar, your reverence, would we come into the venerable Sāriputta's presence to learn the meaning of this utterance.</p>
<p>It were good if the meaning of this utterance were to be made clear by the venerable Sāriputta himself; the monks, having heard it from the venerable Sāriputta, will bear it in mind.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en58"></a>“Very well, your reverences, listen and attend carefully and I will speak.”</p>
<p>“Yes, your reverence,” these monks answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent.</p>
<p>The venerable Sāriputta spoke thus:</p>
<p>“When a disciple of the ariyans comprehends unskill and un-skill's root, and comprehends skill and skill's root, to this extent, your reverences, does a disciple of the ariyans come to be of perfect view, one whose view is upright, who is possessed of unwavering confidence in <i>dhamma</i>, one who has come into this true <i>dhamma</i>.</p>
<p>And what, your reverences, is unskill?</p>
<p>What is unskill's root?</p>
<p>What is skill?</p>
<p>What is skill's root?</p>
<p>Onslaught on creatures, your reverences, is unskill, taking what is not given is unskill, sexual misconduct is unskill, lying speech is unskill, slanderous speech is unskill, harsh speech is unskill, gossip is unskill, covetice is unskill, wrath is unskill, wrong view is unskill.</p>
<p>This, your reverences, is called unskill.</p>
<p>And what, your reverences, is unskill's root?</p>
<p>Greed is unskill's root, hatred is unskill's root, confusion is unskill's root.</p>
<p>This, your reverences, is called unskill's root.</p>
<p>And what, your reverences, is skill?</p>
<p>Restraint from onslaught on creatures is skill, restraint from taking what is not given is skill, restraint from sexual misconduct is skill, restraint from lying speech is skill, restraint from slanderous speech is skill, restraint from harsh speech is skill, restraint from gossip is skill, non-covetice is skill, non-wrath is skill, perfect view is skill.</p>
<p>This, your reverences, is called skill.</p>
<p>And what, your reverences, is skill's root?</p>
<p>Non-greed is skill's root, non-hatred is skill's root, non-confusion is skill's root.</p>
<p>This, your reverences, is called skill's root.</p>
<p>When, your reverences, a disciple of the ariyans comprehends unskill thus, comprehends unskill's root thus, comprehends skill thus, comprehends skill's root thus, he, having got rid of all addiction to attachment, having dispelled addiction to shunning, having abolished addiction to the latent view ‘I am,’ having got rid of ignorance, having made knowledge arise, is here-now an end-maker of anguish.</p>
<p>To this extent, your reverences, does a disciple of the ariyans come to be of perfect view, one whose view is upright, one who is possessed of unwavering confidence in <i>dhamma</i>, one who has come into this true <i>dhamma</i>.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en59"></a>Saying:</p>
<p>“Good, your reverence,” these monks, having rejoiced in what the venerable Sāriputta had said, having approved of it, asked the venerable Sāriputta a further question:</p>
<p>“Might there be, your reverence, also another method by which a disciple of the ariyans comes to be of perfect view, one whose view is upright, one who has unwavering confidence in <i>dhamma</i>, one who has come into this true <i>dhamma</i>?”</p>
<p>“There might be, your reverences.</p>
<p>When, your reverences, a disciple of the ariyans comprehends sustenance and comprehends the uprising of sustenance and comprehends the stopping of sustenance and comprehends the course leading to the stopping of sustenance, to this extent also, your reverences, does a disciple of the ariyans come to be of perfect view, one whose view is upright, one who has unwavering confidence in <i>dhamma</i>, one who has come into this true <i>dhamma</i>.</p>
<p>And what, your reverences, is sustenance?</p>
<p>What is the uprising of sustenance?</p>

<p>What is the course leading to the stopping of sustenance?</p>
<p>Your reverences, there are these four (kinds of) sustenance for the stability of creatures who have come to be or for the assistance of those who are seeking to be.</p>
<p>What are the four?</p>
<p>Material food, coarse or fine; (sense-) impingement is the second; volition is the third; consciousness is the fourth.</p>
<p>From the uprising of craving is the uprising of sustenance, from the stopping of craving is the stopping of sustenance; the course leading to the stopping of sustenance is this ariyan eightfold Way itself, that is to say: perfect view, perfect thought, perfect speech, perfect action, perfect way of living, perfect endeavour, perfect mindfulness, perfect concentration.</p>
<p>When a disciple of the ariyans comprehends sustenance thus, comprehends the uprising of sustenance thus, comprehends the stopping of sustenance thus, comprehends the course leading to the stopping of sustenance thus, he, having got rid of all addiction to attachment, having dispelled addiction to shunning, having abolished addiction to the latent view ‘I am,’ having got rid of ignorance, having made knowledge arise, is here-now an end-maker of anguish.</p>

<p>And what, your reverences, is anguish?</p>
<p>What is the uprising of anguish?</p>
<p>What is the stopping of anguish?</p>
<p>What is the course leading to the stopping of anguish?</p>
<p>Birth is anguish, and old age is anguish, and disease is anguish, and dying is anguish, and grief, lamentation, suffering, tribulation and despair are anguish; and if one does not get what one wants, that too is anguish; in short, the five groups of grasping are anguish.</p>
<p>This, your reverences, is called anguish.</p>
<p>And what, your reverences, is the uprising of anguish?</p>
<p>That craving which is connected with again-becoming, accompanied by delight and attachment, finding delight in this and that, namely the craving for sense-pleasures, the craving for becoming, the craving for annihilation- this, your reverences, is called the origin of anguish.</p>
<p>And what, your reverences, is the stopping of anguish?</p>
<p>Whatever is the stopping, with no attachment remaining, of that selfsame craving, the giving up of it, the renunciation of it, the release from it, the doing away with it- this, your reverences, is called the stopping of anguish.</p>
<p>And what, your reverences, is the course leading to the stopping of anguish?</p>
<p>The course leading to the stopping of anguish is this ariyan eightfold Way itself, that is to say: perfect view, perfect thought, perfect speech, perfect action, perfect way of living, perfect endeavour, perfect mindfulness, perfect concentration.</p>
<p>When, your reverences, the disciple of the ariyans comprehends anguish thus, comprehends its origin thus,
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en61"></a>comprehends its stopping thus, comprehends the course leading to its stopping thus, he, having got rid of all addiction to attachment, having dispelled addiction to shunning, having abolished addiction to the latent view ‘I am,’ having got rid of ignorance, having made knowledge arise, is here-now an end-maker of anguish.</p>
<p>To this extent, also, your reverences, does a disciple of the ariyans come to be of perfect view, one whose view is upright, one who is possessed of unwavering confidence in <i>dhamma</i>, one who has come into this true <i>dhamma</i>.”</p>

<p>What is the origin of old age and dying?</p>
<p>From the uprising of birth is the uprising of ageing-and-dying.</p>
<p>From the stopping of birth is the stopping of ageing-and-dying.</p>
