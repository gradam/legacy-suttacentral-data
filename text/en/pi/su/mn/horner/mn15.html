<p>“Now, if, your reverences, a monk invites, saying:</p>
<p>‘Let the venerable ones speak to me, I should be spoken to by the venerable ones.’</p>
<p>but if he is one whom it is difficult to speak to, endowed with qualities which make him difficult to speak to, intractable, incapable of being instructed, then his fellow Brahmafarers judge that he should not be spoken to and that he should not be instructed and that trust should not be placed in that individual.</p>

<p>If, your reverences, while reflecting, a monk beholds that all these evil unskilled states are not got rid of in himself, then, your reverences, that monk must strive to get rid of all these evil unskilled states.</p>
<p>But if, your reverences, while reflecting, a monk beholds that all these evil unskilled states are got rid of in himself, then, your reverences, with rapture and delight that monk should forsake them, training day and night in skilled states.</p>
<p>Your reverences, it is like a woman or a man, young, in the prime of life, and fond of ornaments who is pondering on his own reflection in a mirror that is quite clear, quite pure, or in a bowl of limpid water.</p>
<p>If he sees dust or blemish there, he strives to get rid of that dust or blemish.</p>
<p>But if he does not see dust or blemish there, he is pleased in consequence and thinks:</p>
<p>‘Indeed, this is good for me, indeed I am quite clean.’</p>
<p>Even so, your reverences, if a monk, while reflecting, beholds that all these evil unskilled states in the self are not got rid of, then, your reverences, he strives to get rid of all these evil, unskilled states.</p>
<p>But if, your reverences, the monk, while reflecting, beholds that all these evil unskilled states in the self are got rid of, then, your reverences, with rapture and delight that monk should forsake them, training day and night in skilled states.”</p>
<p>Thus spoke the venerable Moggallāna the Great. Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the venerable Moggallāna the Great had said.</p>
