But if, your reverences, that monk, while reflecting, knows thus: ‘I, am not stubborn, proud, then, with rapture and delight, they should be forsaken by that monk, training day and night in skilled states.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd70"></a><span class="add">(16)</span> And again, your reverences, self ought to be reflected upon by self thus by a monk: ‘Now, am I one to seize the temporal, grasping it tightly, not letting go of it easily?’ If, your reverences, while the monk is reflecting, he knows thus: ‘I, am one to seize the temporal, grasping it tightly, not letting go of it easily.’ then, your reverences, that<a class="pts" id="pts1.100"></a> monk should strive to get rid of those evil unskilled states. But if, your reverences, that monk, while reflecting, knows thus: ‘I, am not one to seize the temporal, grasping it tightly, not letting go of it easily, then, with rapture and delight,<a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en131"></a> they should be forsaken by that monk, training day and night in skilled states.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd71"></a>If, your reverences, while reflecting, a monk beholds that all these evil unskilled states are not got rid of in himself, then, your reverences, that monk must strive to get rid of all these evil unskilled states.

<p><a class="bd" id="bd72"></a>Your reverences, it is like a woman or a man, young, in the prime of life, and fond of ornaments who is pondering on his own reflection in a mirror that is quite clear, quite pure, or in a bowl of limpid water. If he sees dust or blemish there, he strives to get rid of that dust or blemish. But if he does not see dust or blemish there, he is pleased in consequence and thinks: ‘Indeed, this is good for me, indeed I am quite clean.’ Even so, your reverences, if a monk, while reflecting, beholds that all these evil unskilled states in the self are not got rid of, then, your reverences, he strives to get rid of all these evil, unskilled states. But if, your reverences, the monk, while reflecting, beholds that all these evil unskilled states in the self are got rid of, then, your reverences, with rapture and delight that monk should forsake them, training day and night in skilled states.”</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd73"></a>Thus spoke the venerable Moggallāna the Great. Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the venerable Moggallāna the Great had said.</p>
