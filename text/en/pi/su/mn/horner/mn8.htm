<h1>8. Discourse on Expunging</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="wp" id="wp1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard:</span></p>
<p>At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Then the venerable Cunda the Great, emerging towards evening from solitary meditation, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance the venerable Cunda the Great spoke thus to the Lord:</p>
<p>“Those various types of views, Lord, that arise in the world and are connected with theories of the self or with theories of the world, does there come to be ejection of these views, does there come to be renunciation of these views for a monk who wisely reflects from the beginning?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en52"></a>“Those various types of views, Cunda, that arise in the world and are connected with theories of the self or with theories of the world, wherever these views arise and wherever they obsess (the mind) and wherever they are current, it is by seeing them with perfect wisdom as they really are, thus: ‘This is not mine, this am I not, this is not my self,’ that there is ejection of these views, that there is renunciation of these views.</p>
<p>The situation occurs, Cunda, when a monk here, aloof from pleasures of the senses, aloof from unskilled states of mind, may enter on and abide in the first meditation which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought, is born of aloofness, and is rapturous and joyful. It may occur to him: ‘I fare along by expunging.’ But these, Cunda, are not called expungings in the discipline for an ariyan; these are called: ‘abidings in ease here-now’ in the discipline for an ariyan.</p>
<p>This situation occurs, Cunda, when some monk here, by allaying initial thought and discursive thought, with the mind subjectively tranquillised and fixed on one point, may enter on and abide in the second meditation which is devoid of initial and discursive thought, is born of concentration, and is rapturous and joyful. It may occur to him: ‘I fare along by expunging.’ But these, Cunda, are not called expungings in the discipline for an ariyan; these are called ‘abidings in ease here-now’ in the discipline for an ariyan.</p>
<p>This situation occurs, Cunda, when some monk here, by the fading out of rapture, may abide with equanimity, attentive, and clearly conscious, and may experience in his person that joy of which the ariyans say: ‘Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,’ and may enter on and abide in the third meditation. It may occur to him: ‘I fare along by expunging.’ But these, Cunda, are not called expungings in the discipline for an ariyan; these are called: ‘abidings in ease here-now’ in the discipline for an ariyan.</p>
<p>This situation occurs, Cunda, when some monk here, by getting rid of joy, by getting rid of anguish, by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows, may enter on and abide in the fourth meditation which has neither anguish nor joy, and that is entirely purified by equanimity and mindfulness. It may occur to him: <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en53"></a>‘I fare along by expunging.’ But these, Cunda, are not called expungings in the discipline for an ariyan; these are called: ‘abidings in ease here-now’ in the discipline for an ariyan.</p>
<p>This situation occurs, Cunda, when some monk here, by wholly transcending perceptions of material shapes, by the going down of perceptions due to sensory impressions, by not reflecting on the perceptions of multiformity, thinking: ‘Ether is unending,’ may enter on and abide in the plane of infinite ether. It may occur to him: ‘I fare along by expunging.’ But these, Cunda, are not called expungings in the discipline for an ariyan; these are called: ‘abidings that are peaceful’ in the discipline for an ariyan.</p>
<p>This situation occurs, Cunda, when some monk here, by wholly transcending the plane of infinite ether, thinking: ‘Consciousness is unending,’ may enter on and abide in the plane of infinite consciousness. It may occur to him: ‘I fare along by expunging.’ But these, Cunda, are not called expungings in the discipline for an ariyan; these are called: ‘abidings that are peaceful’ in the discipline for an ariyan.</p>
<p>This situation occurs, Cunda, when some monk here, by wholly transcending the plane of infinite consciousness, thinking: ‘There is no-thing,’ may enter on and abide in the plane of no-thing. It may occur to him: ‘I fare along by expunging.’ But these, Cunda, are not called expungings in the discipline for an ariyan; these are called: ‘abidings that are peaceful’ in the discipline for an ariyan.</p>
<p>This situation occurs, Cunda, when some monk here, by wholly transcending the plane of no-thing, may enter on and abide in the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. It may occur to him: ‘I fare along by expunging.’ But these, Cunda, are not called expungings in the discipline for an ariyan; these are called: ‘abidings that are peaceful’ in the discipline for an ariyan.</p>
<p>Herein, Cunda, is expunging to be done by you, thinking:</p>

<p>Now I, Cunda, say that the arising of thought is very helpful in regard to skilled states (of mind), not to speak of gesture and speech that are in conformity (with thought).</p>
<p>Therefore, Cunda, the thought should arise:</p>
<p>[1] ‘Others may be harmful; we, as to this, will not be harmful.’</p>
<p>The thought should arise:</p>
<p>[2] ‘Others may be those to make onslaught on creatures; we, as to this, will be those who are restrained from making onslaught on creatures.’</p>
<p>The thought should arise:</p>

<p>This situation does not occur, Cunda, when one sunk into mud will by himself pull out another who is sunk into mud. But this situation occurs, Cunda, when one not sunk into mud will by himself pull out another who is sunk into mud.</p>
<p>This situation does not occur, Cunda, when one who is not tamed, not trained, not utterly quenched, will by himself tame, train, make another utterly quenched. But this situation occurs, Cunda, when one who is tamed, trained, utterly quenched, will by himself tame, train, make another utterly quenched.</p>
<p>Even so, Cunda,</p>
<p>[1] there is non-harming by means of utter quenching for an individual who is harmful;</p>
<p>[2] there is restraint from onslaught on creatures by means of utter quenching for an individual who makes onslaught on creatures;</p>

<p>In this manner, Cunda, is taught by me the disquisition on expunging, is taught the disquisition on the uprising of thought, is taught the disquisition on going by, is taught the disquisition on upwards, is taught the disquisition on utter quenching. Whatever, Cunda, is to be done from compassion by a teacher seeking the welfare of his disciples, that has been done by me out of compassion for you. These, Cunda, are the roots of trees, these are empty <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en57"></a>places. Meditate, Cunda; do not be slothful; be not remorseful later. This is our instruction to you.”</p>
<p>Thus spoke the Lord. Delighted, the venerable Cunda rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
