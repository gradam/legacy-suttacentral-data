<h1>23. Discourse on the Anthill</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="wp" id="wp1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard:</span></p>
<p>At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Now at that time the venerable Kassapa the Boy was staying in the Blind Men's Grove. Then, when the night was far spent a certain deva with a glorious skin, having illuminated the whole of the Blind Men's Grove, approached the venerable Kassapa the Boy; and having approached stood at one side. While standing at one side this deva spoke thus to the venerable Kassapa the Boy:</p>
<p><a class="wp" id="wp2"></a>“Monk, monk, this ant-hill smokes by night, blazes up by day. A brahman speaks thus:</p>
<p>‘Bringing a tool, clever one, dig it up.’</p>
<p>The clever one, digging when he had brought a tool saw a bolt and said:</p>
<p>‘A bolt, revered one.’</p>
<p>The brahman spoke thus:</p>
<p>‘Take out the bolt, dig on, clever one, bringing a tool.’</p>
<p>The clever one, digging on when he had brought a tool, saw a frog, and said:</p>
<p>‘A frog, revered one.’</p>
<p>The brahman spoke thus:</p>
<p>‘Take out the frog, dig on, clever one, bringing a tool.’</p>
<p>The clever one, digging on when he had brought a tool, saw a forked path, and said:</p>
<p>‘A forked path, revered one.’</p>
<p>The brahman spoke thus:</p>
<p>‘Take out the forked path, dig on, clever one, bringing a tool.’</p>
<p>The clever one, digging on when he had brought <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en184"></a>a tool, saw a strainer, and said:</p>
<p>‘A strainer, revered one.’</p>
<p>The brahman spoke thus:</p>
<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.143"></a>‘Take out the strainer, dig on, clever one, bringing a tool.’</p>
<p>The clever one, digging on when he had brought a tool, saw a tortoise, and said:</p>
<p>‘A tortoise, revered one.’</p>
<p>The brahman spoke thus:</p>
<p>‘Take out the tortoise, dig on, clever one, bringing a tool.’</p>
<p>The clever one, digging on when he had brought a tool, saw a slaughter-house, and said:</p>
<p>‘A slaughter-house, revered one.’</p>
<p>The brahman spoke thus:</p>
<p>‘Take out the slaughter-house, dig on, clever one, bringing a tool.’</p>
<p>The clever one, digging on when he had brought a tool, saw a piece of flesh, and said:</p>
<p>‘A piece of flesh, revered one.’</p>
<p>The brahman spoke thus:</p>
<p>‘Take out the piece of flesh, dig on, clever one, bringing a tool.’</p>
<p>The clever one, digging on when he had brought a tool, saw a cobra, and said:</p>
<p>‘A cobra, revered one.’</p>
<p>The brahman spoke thus:</p>
<p>‘Let the cobra be, do not touch the cobra, do reverence to the cobra.’</p>
<p>If you, monk, having approached the Lord, were to ask him about these questions, then you could remember as the Lord explains to you. I, monk, do not see anyone in the world with its devas, with its Māras, with its Brahmās, in creation, with its recluses and brahmans, its devas and men, who could turn his mind to expounding these questions except a Tathāgata, or a Tathāgata's disciple, or one who has heard (the teaching) from them.”</p>
<p>Thus spoke that deva; and vanished then and there, having said this.</p>
<p><a class="wp" id="wp3"></a>Then the venerable Kassapa the Boy approached the Lord towards the end of that night; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the venerable Kassapa the Boy spoke thus to the Lord:</p>
<p>“During this night, Lord, when the night was far spent, a certain deva with a glorious skin, having illumined the whole of the Blind Men's Grove, approached me, and having approached, stood at one side. While standing to one side, Lord, that deva spoke thus to me:</p>
<p>“Monk, monk, this ant-hill smokes by night, blazes up by day. A brahman speaks thus:</p>
<p>‘Bringing a tool, clever one, dig it up.’</p>
<p>The clever one, digging when he had brought a tool saw a bolt and said:</p>
<p>‘A bolt, revered one.’</p>
<p>The brahman spoke thus:</p>
<p>‘Take out the bolt, dig on, clever one, bringing a tool.’</p>
<p>The clever one, digging on when he had brought a tool, saw a frog, and said:</p>
<p>‘A frog, revered one.’</p>
<p>The brahman spoke thus:</p>
<p>‘Take out the frog, dig on, clever one, bringing a tool.’</p>
<p>The clever one, digging on when he had brought a tool, saw a forked path, and said:</p>
<p>‘A forked path, revered one.’</p>
<p>The brahman spoke thus:</p>
<p>‘Take out the forked path, dig on, clever one, bringing a tool.’</p>
<p>The clever one, digging on when he had brought a tool, saw a strainer, and said:</p>
<p>‘A strainer, revered one.’</p>
<p>The brahman spoke thus:</p>
<p>‘Take out the strainer, dig on, clever one, bringing a tool.’</p>
<p>The clever one, digging on when he had brought a tool, saw a tortoise, and said:</p>
<p>‘A tortoise, revered one.’</p>
<p>The brahman spoke thus:</p>
<p>‘Take out the tortoise, dig on, clever one, bringing a tool.’</p>
<p>The clever one, digging on when he had brought a tool, saw a slaughter-house, and said:</p>
<p>‘A slaughter-house, revered one.’</p>
<p>The brahman spoke thus:</p>
<p>‘Take out the slaughter-house, dig on, clever one, bringing a tool.’</p>
<p>The clever one, digging on when he had brought a tool, saw a piece of flesh, and said:</p>
<p>‘A piece of flesh, revered one.’</p>
<p>The brahman spoke thus:</p>
<p>‘Take out the piece of flesh, dig on, clever one, bringing a tool.’</p>
<p>The clever one, digging on when he had brought a tool, saw a cobra, and said:</p>
<p>‘A cobra, revered one.’</p>
<p>The brahman spoke thus:</p>
<p>‘Let the cobra be, do not touch the cobra, do reverence to the cobra.’</p>
<p>If you, monk, having approached the Lord, were to ask him about these questions, then you could remember as the Lord explains to you. I, monk, do not see anyone in the world with its devas, with its Māras, with its Brahmās, in creation, with its recluses and brahmans, its devas and men, who could turn his mind to expounding these questions except a Tathāgata, or a Tathāgata's disciple, or one who has heard (the teaching) from them.”</p>
<p>This is what the deva said, Lord, and vanished then and there, having said this.</p>
<p>Now what, Lord is the anthill?</p>
<p>What is smoking by night?</p>
<p>What is blazing up by day?</p>
