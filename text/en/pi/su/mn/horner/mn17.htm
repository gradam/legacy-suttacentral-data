</div>
<p><a class="wp" id="wp1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard:</span></p>
<p>At one time the Lord was staying near Savatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>
<p>There the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks.”</p>
<p>“Revered One,” these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>
<p>The Lord spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Monks, I will teach you the disquisition on the forest grove.</p>
<p>Listen to it, pay careful attention to it, and I will speak.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Lord,” the monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>
<p>“In this connection, monks, a monk is staying in a certain forest grove.</p>
<p>While lie is staying in that forest grove mindfulness which had not been aroused is not aroused, and thought which was not composed is not composed, and the cankers which were not totally destroyed do not come to total destruction, and the incomparable security from the bonds which had not been attained is not attained, and those necessities of life which should be procured by one who <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en137"></a>has gone forth- robe-material, almsfood, lodgings, medicines for the sick- these are to be got (only) with difficulty.</p>
