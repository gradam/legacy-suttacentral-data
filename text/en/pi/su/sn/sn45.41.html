<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthī. “Bhikkhus, if wanderers of other sects ask you: ‘For what purpose, friends, is the holy life lived under the ascetic Gotama?’—being asked thus, you should answer them thus: ‘It is, friends, for the fading away of lust that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Then, bhikkhus, if the wanderers of other sects ask you: ‘But, friends, is there a path, is there a way for the fading away of lust?’—being asked thus, you should answer them thus: ‘There is a path, friends, there is a way for the fading away of lust.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is that path, what is that way <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.28"></a> for the fading away of lust? It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view ... right concentration. This is the path, this is the way for the fading away of lust.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Being asked thus, bhikkhus, you should answer those wanderers of other sects in such a way.”</p>
