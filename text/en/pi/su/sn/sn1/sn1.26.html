<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a> “How many sources of light are in the world<br>
By means of which the world is illumined?<br>
We have come to ask the Blessed One this:<br>
How are we to understand it?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a> “There are four sources of light in the world;<br>
A fifth one is not found here.<br>
The sun shines by day,<br>
The moon glows at night,<br>
67 And fire flares up here and there<br>
Both by day and at night.<br>
But the Buddha is the best of those that shine:<br>
He is the light unsurpassed.”</p>
