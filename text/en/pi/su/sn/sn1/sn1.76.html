<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a> “What decays, what does not decay?<br>
What is declared the deviant path?<br>
What is the impediment to <span class="supplied">wholesome</span> states?<br>
What undergoes destruction night and day?<br>
What is the stain of the holy life?<br>
What is the bath without water?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a> “How many fissures are there in the world<br>
Wherein the mind does not stand firm?<br>
We’ve come to ask the Blessed One this:<br>
How are we to understand it?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a> “The physical form of mortals decays,<br>
Their name and clan does not decay.<br>
Lust is declared the deviant path,<br>
Greed the impediment to <span class="supplied">wholesome</span> states.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a> “Life undergoes destruction night and day;<br>
Women are the stain of the holy life:<br>
Here’s where menfolk are enmeshed.<br>
Austerity and the holy life—<br>
That is the bath without water.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a> “There are six fissures in the world<br>
Wherein the mind does not stand firm:<br>
Laziness and negligence,<br>
Indolence, lack of self-control,<br>
Drowsiness and lethargy—<br>
Avoid these fissures completely.”</p>
