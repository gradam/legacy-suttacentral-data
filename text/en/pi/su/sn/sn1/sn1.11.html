<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Once in the past, bhikkhus, a certain devatā of the Tavatiṃsa host was revelling in Nandana Grove, &lt; 11 &gt; supplied and endowed with the five cords of celestial sensual pleasure, accompanied by a retinue of celestial nymphs. On that occasion he spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a> “‘They do not know bliss<br>
Who have not seen Nandana,<br>
The abode of the glorious male devas<br>
Belonging to the host of Thirty.’ <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.i.6"></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“When this was said, bhikkhus, a certain devatā replied to that devatā in verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a> “‘Don’t you know, you fool,<br>
That maxim of the arahants?<br>
Impermanent are all formations;<br>
Their nature is to arise and vanish.<br>
Having arisen, they cease:<br>
Their appeasement is blissful.’”</p>
