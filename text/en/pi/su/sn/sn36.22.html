<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, are the six kinds of feelings? Feeling born of eye-contact … feeling born of mind-contact. These are called the six kinds of feeling.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, are the eighteen kinds of feelings? Six examinations accompanied by joy, six examinations accompanied by displeasure, six examinations accompanied by equanimity. These are called the eighteen kinds of feelings.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, are the thirty-six kinds of feelings? Six types of joy based on the household life, six types of joy based on renunciation; six types of displeasure based on the household life, six types of displeasure based on renunciation; six types of equanimity based on the household life, six types of equanimity based on renunciation. These are called the thirty-six kinds of feelings. “And what, bhikkhus, are the hundred and eight kinds of feelings? The <span class="supplied">above</span> thirty-six feelings in the past, the <span class="supplied">above</span> thirty-six feelings in the future, the <span class="supplied">above</span> thirty-six feelings at present. These are called the hundred and eight kinds of feelings.</p>
