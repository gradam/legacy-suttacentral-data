<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthī. There the Blessed One said this: “Bhikkhus, once in the past Sakka, lord of the devas, addressed his charioteer Matali thus: ‘Harness the chariot with its team of a thousand thoroughbreds, friend Matali. Let us go to the park grounds to see the beautiful scenery.’—‘Yes, your lordship,’ Matali the charioteer replied. Then he harnessed the chariot with its team of a thousand thoroughbreds and announced to Sakka, lord of the devas: ‘The chariot has been harnessed, dear sir. You may come at your own convenience.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Then, bhikkhus, Sakka, lord of the devas, descending from the Vejayanta Palace, raised his joined hands in reverential salutation, and worshipped the different quarters. Then Matali the charioteer addressed Sakka in verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a> “‘These all humbly worship you—<br>
Those versed in the Triple Veda,<br>
All the khattiyas reigning on earth,<br>
The Four Great Kings and the glorious Thirty—<br>
So who, O Sakka, is that spirit<br>
To whom you bow in worship?’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="supplied">Sakka:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a> “‘These all humbly worship me—<br>
Those versed in the Triple Veda,<br>
All the khattiyas reigning on earth,<br>
The Four Great Kings and the glorious Thirty—</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a> But I worship those endowed with virtue,<br>
Those long trained in concentration,<br>
Those who have properly gone forth<br>
With the holy life their destination.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a> “‘I worship as well, O Matali,<br>
Those householders making merit,<br>
The lay followers possessed of virtue<br>
Who righteously maintain a wife.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="supplied">Matali:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a> “‘Those whom you worship, my lord Sakka,<br>
Are indeed the best in the world.<br>
I too will worship them—<br>
Those whom you worship, Vasava.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="supplied">The Blessed One:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a> “Having given this explanation,<br>
Having worshipped the different quarters,<br>
The deva-king Maghava, Suja’s husband,<br>
The chief, climbed into his chariot.” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.i.235"></a></p>
