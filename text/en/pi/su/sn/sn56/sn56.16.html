<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, do you remember the Four Noble Truths taught by me?” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.428"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, I remember the Four Noble Truths taught by the Blessed One.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“But how, bhikkhu, do you remember the Four Noble Truths taught by me?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“I remember suffering, venerable sir, as the first noble truth taught by the Blessed One. For if any ascetic or brahmin should speak thus: ‘This is not the first noble truth of suffering taught by the ascetic Gotama; having rejected this first noble truth of suffering, I will make known another first noble truth of suffering’—this is impossible.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“I remember the origin of suffering as the second noble truth taught by the Blessed One…. I remember the cessation of suffering as the third noble truth taught by the Blessed One…. I remember the way leading to the cessation of suffering as the fourth noble truth taught by the Blessed One. For if any ascetic or brahmin should speak thus: ‘This is not the fourth noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering taught by the ascetic Gotama; having rejected this fourth noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering, I will make known another fourth noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering’—this is impossible.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“It is in this way, venerable sir, that I remember the Four Noble Truths taught by the Blessed One.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“Good, good, bhikkhu! It is good that you remember the Four Noble Truths taught by me. Suffering, bhikkhu, is the first noble truth taught by me: remember it thus. For if any ascetic or brahmin should speak thus … <span class="add">as above</span> … <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.429"></a> ‘This is not the fourth noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering taught by the ascetic Gotama; having rejected this fourth noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering, I will make known another fourth noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering’—this is impossible.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“In this way, bhikkhu, remember the Four Noble Truths taught by me.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“Therefore, bhikkhu, an exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is suffering.’… An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’”</p>
