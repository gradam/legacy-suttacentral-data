<h1>4. Mara’s Snare (1)</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a> Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Baraṇasi in the Deer Park at Isipatana. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Bhikkhus, by careful attention, by careful right striving, I have arrived at unsurpassed liberation, I have realized unsurpassed liberation. You too, bhikkhus, by careful attention, by careful right striving, must arrive at unsurpassed liberation, must realize unsurpassed liberation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Then Mara the Evil One approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a> “You are bound by Mara’s snare<br>
Both celestial and human;<br>
You are bound by Mara’s bondage:<br>
You won’t escape me, ascetic!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="supplied">The Blessed One:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a> “I am freed from Mara’s snare<br>
Both celestial and human;<br>
I am freed from Mara’s bondage:<br>
You’re defeated, End-maker!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Mara the Evil One … disappeared right there.</p>
