<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, when what exists, by clinging to what, by adhering to what, does the thought occur: ‘I am superior’ or ‘I am equal’ or ‘I am inferior’?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One….”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“When there is the eye, bhikkhus, by clinging to the eye, by adhering to the eye, the thought occurs: ‘I am superior’ or ‘I am equal’ or ‘I am inferior.’ When there is the ear ... When there is the mind, by clinging to the mind, by adhering to the mind, the thought occurs: ‘I am superior’ or ‘I am equal’ or ‘I am inferior.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“What do you think, bhikkhus, is the eye ... the mind permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p>“Impermanent, venerable sir.”…</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“But without clinging to what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, could the thought occur: ‘I am superior’ or ‘I am equal’ or ‘I am inferior’?”</p>
<p>“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Seeing thus ... He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.89"></a></p>
