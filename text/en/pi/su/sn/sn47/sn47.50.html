<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these three taints. What three? The taint of sensuality, the taint of existence, the taint of ignorance. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.190"></a> These are the three taints. The four establishments of mindfulness are to be developed for the full understanding of these three taints.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“What four? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body … feelings in feelings … mind in mind … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world.</p>
