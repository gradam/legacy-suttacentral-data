<h1>49. The Noble Disciple (1)</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthī. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.78"></a> “Bhikkhus, an instructed noble disciple does not think: ‘When what exists does what come to be? With the arising of what does what arise? <span class="add">When what exists do volitional formations come to be? When what exists does consciousness come to be?</span> When what exists does name-and-form come to be?… When what exists does aging-and-death come to be?’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Rather, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple has knowledge about this that is independent of others: ‘When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises. <span class="add">When there is ignorance, volitional formations come to be. When there are volitional formations, consciousness comes to be.</span> When there is consciousness, name-and-form comes to be…. When there is birth, aging-and-death comes to be.’ He understands thus: ‘In such a way the world originates.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Bhikkhus, an instructed noble disciple does not think: ‘When what does not exist does what not come to be? With the cessation of what does what cease? <span class="add">When what does not exist do volitional formations not come to be? When what does not exist does consciousness not come to be?</span> When what does not exist does name-and-form not come to be?… When what does not exist does aging-and-death not come to be?’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Rather, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple has knowledge about this that is independent of others: ‘When this does not exist, that does not come to be; with the cessation of this, that ceases. <span class="add">When there is no ignorance, volitional formations do not come to be. When there are no volitional formations, consciousness does not come to be.</span> When there is no consciousness, name-and-form does not come to be…. When there is no birth, aging-and-death does not come to be.’ He understands thus: ‘In such a way the world ceases.’ <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.79"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Bhikkhus, when a noble disciple thus understands as they really are the origin and the passing away of the world, he is then called a noble disciple who is accomplished in view, accomplished in vision, who has arrived at this true Dhamma, who sees this true Dhamma, who possesses a trainee’s knowledge, a trainee’s true knowledge, who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, a noble one with penetrative wisdom, one who stands squarely before the door to the Deathless.”</p>
