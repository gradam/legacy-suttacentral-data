<h1>27. Conditions</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthī. “Bhikkhus, with ignorance as condition, volitional formations <span class="supplied">come to be</span>; with volitional formations as condition, consciousness … Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is aging-and-death? The aging of the various beings ... <span class="supplied">as in §2</span> … thus this aging and this death are together called aging-and-death. With the arising of birth there is the arising of aging-and-death; with the cessation of birth there is the cessation of aging-and-death. Just this Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of aging-and-death; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is birth?… existence?… clinging?… <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.43"></a> … craving?… feeling?… contact?… the six sense bases?… name-and-form? … consciousness?… volitional formations? There are these three kinds of volitional formations: the bodily volitional formation, the verbal volitional formation, the mental volitional formation. With the arising of ignorance there is the arising of volitional formations. With the cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of volitional formations. Just this Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of volitional formations; that is, right view ... right concentration.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple thus understands the condition; thus understands the origin of the condition; thus understands the cessation of the condition; thus understands the way leading to the cessation of the condition, he is then called a noble disciple who is accomplished in view, accomplished in vision, who has arrived at this true Dhamma, who sees this true Dhamma, who possesses a trainee’s knowledge, a trainee’s true knowledge, who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, a noble one with penetrative wisdom, one who stands squarely before the door to the Deathless.”</p>
