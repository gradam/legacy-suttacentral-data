<h1>19. The Wise Man and the Fool</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthī. “Bhikkhus, for the fool, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.24"></a> this body has thereby originated. So there is this body and external name-and-form: thus this dyad. Dependent on the dyad there is contact. There are just six sense bases, contacted through which—or through a certain one among them—the fool experiences pleasure and pain.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Bhikkhus, for the wise man, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, this body has thereby originated. So there is this body and external name-and-form: thus this dyad. Dependent on the dyad there is contact. There are just six sense bases, contacted through which—or through a certain one among them—the wise man experiences pleasure and pain. What, bhikkhus, is the distinction here, what is the disparity, what is the difference between the wise man and the fool?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One, take recourse in the Blessed One. It would be good if the Blessed One would clear up the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus will remember it.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Then listen and attend closely, bhikkhus, I will speak.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Yes, venerable sir,” the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Bhikkhus, for the fool, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, this body has originated. For the fool that ignorance has not been abandoned and that craving has not been utterly destroyed. For what reason? Because the fool has not lived the holy life for the complete destruction of suffering. Therefore, with the breakup of the body, the fool fares on to <span class="add">another</span> body. Faring on to <span class="add">another</span> body, he is not freed from birth, aging, and death; not freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; not freed from suffering, I say.</p>

For the wise man that ignorance has been abandoned and that craving has been utterly destroyed. For what reason?

<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“This, bhikkhus, is the distinction, the disparity, the difference between the wise man and the fool, that is, the living of the holy life.”</p>
