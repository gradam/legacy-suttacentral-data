<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthī. “Herein, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu understands aging-and-death, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation. He understands birth ... existence ... clinging <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.44"></a> … craving ... feeling ... contact ... the six sense bases ... name-and-form … consciousness ... volitional formations, their origin, their cessation, and the way leading to their cessation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is aging-and-death?… <span class="add">as in preceding sutta</span> … Just this Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of volitional formations; that is, right view ... right concentration.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“When, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu thus understands aging-and-death, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation; when he thus understands birth ... existence ... clinging ... craving ... feeling ... contact ... the six sense bases ... name-and-form ... <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.45"></a> consciousness ... volitional formations, their origin, their cessation, and the way leading to their cessation, he is then called a bhikkhu who is accomplished in view, accomplished in vision, who has arrived at this true Dhamma, who sees this true Dhamma, who possesses a trainee’s knowledge, a trainee’s true knowledge, who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, a noble one with penetrative wisdom, one who stands squarely before the door to the Deathless.”</p>
