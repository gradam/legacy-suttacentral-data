<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, before my enlightenment, while I was still a bodhisatta, not yet fully enlightened, it occurred to me: “What now is feeling? What is the origin of feeling? What is the way leading to the origination of feeling? What is the cessation of feeling? What is the way leading to the cessation of feeling? What is the gratification in feeling? What is the danger? What is the escape?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Then, bhikkhus, it occurred to me: ‘There are these three feelings … <span class="supplied">all as in preceding sutta</span> ... this is the escape from feeling.’”</p>
