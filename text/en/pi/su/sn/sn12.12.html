<h1>12. Moḷiyaphagguna</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthī. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.13"></a> “Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of nutriment for the maintenance of beings that have already come to be and for the assistance of those about to come to be. What four? The nutriment edible food, gross or subtle; second, contact; third, mental volition; fourth, consciousness. These are the four kinds of nutriment for the maintenance of beings that have already come to be and for the assistance of those about to come to be.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>When this was said, the Venerable Moḷiyaphagguna said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, who consumes the nutriment consciousness?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Not a valid question,” the Blessed One replied. “I do not say, ‘One consumes.’ If I should say, ‘One consumes,’ in that case this would be a valid question: ‘Venerable sir, who consumes?’ But I do not speak thus. Since I do not speak thus, if one should ask me, ‘Venerable sir, for what is the nutriment consciousness <span class="supplied">a condition</span>?’ this would be a valid question. To this the valid answer is: ‘The nutriment consciousness is a condition for the production of future renewed existence. When that which has come into being exists, the six sense bases <span class="supplied">come to be</span>; with the six sense bases as condition, contact.’”</p>
<p>“Venerable sir, who makes contact?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Not a valid question,” the Blessed One replied. “I do not say, ‘One makes contact.’ If I should say, ‘One makes contact,’ in that case this would be a valid question: ‘Venerable sir, who makes contact?’ But I do not speak thus. Since I do not speak thus, if one should ask me, ‘Venerable sir, with what as condition does contact <span class="supplied">come to be</span>?’ this would be a valid question. To this the valid answer is: ‘With the six sense bases as condition, contact <span class="supplied">comes to be</span>; with contact as condition, feeling.’”</p>
<p>“Venerable sir, who feels?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Not a valid question,” the Blessed One replied. “I do not say, ‘One feels.’ If I should say, ‘One feels,’ in that case this would be a valid question: ‘Venerable sir, who feels?’ But I do not speak thus. Since I do not speak thus, if one should ask me, ‘Venerable sir, with what as condition does feeling <span class="supplied">come to be</span>?’ this would be a valid question. To this the valid answer is: ‘With contact as condition, feeling <span class="supplied">comes to be</span>; with feeling as condition, craving.’”</p>
<p>“Venerable sir, who craves?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Not a valid question,” the Blessed One replied. “I do not say, ‘One craves.’ <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.14"></a> If I should say, ‘One craves,’ in that case this would be a valid question: ‘Venerable sir, who craves?’ But I do not speak thus. Since I do not speak thus, if one should ask me, ‘Venerable sir, with what as condition does craving <span class="supplied">come to be</span>?’ this would be a valid question. To this the valid answer is: ‘With feeling as condition, craving <span class="supplied">comes to be</span>; with craving as condition, clinging; with clinging as condition, existence.... Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“But, Phagguna, with the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six bases for contact comes cessation of contact; with the cessation of contact, cessation of feeling; with the cessation of feeling, cessation of craving; with the cessation of craving, cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging, cessation of existence; with the cessation of existence, cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.”</p>
