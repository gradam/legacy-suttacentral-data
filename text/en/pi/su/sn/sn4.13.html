<h1>13. The Splinter</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Maddakucchi Deer Park. Now on that occasion the Blessed One’s foot had been cut by a stone splinter. Severe pains assailed the Blessed One—bodily feelings that were painful, racking, sharp, piercing, harrowing, disagreeable. But the Blessed One endured them, mindful and clearly comprehending, without becoming distressed. Then the Blessed One had his outer robe folded in four, and he lay down on his right side in the lion posture with one leg overlapping the other, mindful and clearly comprehending.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Then Mara the Evil One approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a> “Do you lie down in a daze or drunk on poetry?<br>
Don’t you have sufficient goals to meet?<br>
Alone in a secluded lodging<br>
Why do you sleep with a drowsy face?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="supplied">The Blessed One:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a> “I do not lie in a daze or drunk on poetry;<br>
Having reached the goal, I am rid of sorrow.<br>
Alone in a secluded lodging<br>
I lie down full of compassion for all beings.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a> “Even those with a dart stuck in the breast<br>
Piercing their heart moment by moment—<br>
Even these here, stricken, get to sleep; <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.i.111"></a><br>
So why should I not get to sleep<br>
When my dart has been drawn out?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a> “I do not lie awake in dread,<br>
Nor am I afraid to sleep.<br>
The nights and days do not afflict me,<br>
I see for myself no decline in the world.<br>
Therefore I can sleep in peace,<br>
Full of compassion for all beings.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Mara the Evil One … disappeared right there.</p>
