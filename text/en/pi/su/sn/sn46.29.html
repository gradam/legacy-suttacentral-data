<p>Connected Discourses on the Factors of Enlightenment</p>
<h1>29. One Thing</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other thing that, when developed and cultivated, leads to the abandoning of the things that fetter so effectively as this: the seven factors of enlightenment. What seven? The enlightenment factor of mindfulness … the enlightenment factor of equanimity.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And how, bhikkhus, are the seven factors of enlightenment developed and cultivated so that they lead to the abandoning of the things that fetter? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release…. He develops the enlightenment factor of equanimity, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. It is when the seven factors of enlightenment are developed and cultivated in this way that they lead to the abandoning of the things that fetter. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.89"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, are the things that fetter? The eye is a thing that fetters; it is here that these fetters, shackles, and clamps arise. The ear is a thing that fetters ... The mind is a thing that fetters; it is here that these fetters, shackles, and clamps arise. These are called the things that fetter.”</p>
