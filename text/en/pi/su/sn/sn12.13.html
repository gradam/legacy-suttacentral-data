<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthī. “Bhikkhus, those ascetics or brahmins who do not understand aging-and-death, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation; who do not understand birth ... existence ... clinging ... craving ... feeling ... contact ... the six sense bases ... name-and-form ...consciousness ... volitional formations, their origin, their cessation, and the way leading to their cessation: <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.15"></a> these I do not consider to be ascetics among ascetics or brahmins among brahmins, and these venerable ones do not, by realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge, in this very life enter and dwell in the goal of asceticism or the goal of brahminhood.</p>
