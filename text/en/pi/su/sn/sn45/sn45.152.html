<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, suppose a tree were slanting, sloping, and inclining towards the east. If it were cut at its foot, in what direction would it fall?” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.48"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“In whatever direction it was slanting, sloping, and inclining, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“So too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“And how does a bhikkhu do so? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view ... right concentration, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path so that he slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.”</p>
