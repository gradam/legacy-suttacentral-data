<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, one thing is very helpful for the arising of the Noble Eightfold Path. What one thing? Accomplishment in virtue ... Accomplishment in desire ... Accomplishment in self ... Accomplishment in view ... Accomplishment in diligence … Accomplishment in careful attention … <span class="add">complete as in §63</span> <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.34"></a> … He develops right concentration, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release.
