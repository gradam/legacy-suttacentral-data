<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, if wanderers of other sects ask you: ‘For what purpose, friends, is the holy life lived under the ascetic Gotama?’—being asked thus, you should answer them thus: ‘It is, friends, for the abandoning of the fetters ... for the uprooting of the underlying tendencies ... for the full understanding of the course … for the destruction of the taints ... for the realization of the fruit of true knowledge and liberation ... for the sake of knowledge and vision ... <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.29"></a> … for the sake of final Nibbāna without clinging that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Then, bhikkhus, if the wanderers of other sects ask you: ‘But, friends, is there a path, is there a way for attaining final Nibbāna without clinging?’—being asked thus, you should answer them thus: ‘There is a path, friends, there is a way for attaining final Nibbāna without clinging.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is that path, what is that way for attaining final Nibbāna without clinging? It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view ... right concentration. This is the path, this is the way for attaining final Nibbāna without clinging.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Being asked thus, bhikkhus, you should answer those wanderers of other sects in such a way.”</p>
