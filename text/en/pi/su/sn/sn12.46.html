<h1>46. A Certain Brahmin</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthī. Then a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to him:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“How is it, Master Gotama: is the one who acts the same as the one who experiences <span class="supplied">the result</span>?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“‘The one who acts is the same as the one who experiences <span class="supplied">the result</span>’: this, brahmin, is one extreme.” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.76"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Then, Master Gotama, is the one who acts one, and the one who experiences <span class="supplied">the result</span> another?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“‘The one who acts is one, and the one who experiences <span class="supplied">the result</span> is another’: this, brahmin, is the second extreme. Without veering towards either of these extremes, the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma by the middle: ‘With ignorance as condition, volitional formations <span class="supplied">come to be</span>; with volitional formations as condition, consciousness…. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations; with the cessation of volitional formations, cessation of consciousness…. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>When this was said, that brahmin said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama!… I go for refuge to Master Gotama, and to the Dhamma, and to the Bhikkhu Saṅgha. From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>
