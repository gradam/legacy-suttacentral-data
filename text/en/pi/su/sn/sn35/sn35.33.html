<h1>33. Subject to Birth</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthi. “Bhikkhus, all is subject to birth. And what, bhikkhus, is the all that is subject to birth? <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.27"></a> The eye is subject to birth. Forms … Eye-consciousness … Eye-contact … Whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition … that too is subject to birth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“The ear … The tongue … The body … The mind … Whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition … that too is subject to birth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards the eye, towards forms, towards eye-consciousness, towards eye-contact … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”</p>
