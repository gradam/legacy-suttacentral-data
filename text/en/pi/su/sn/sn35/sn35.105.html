<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, when what exists, by clinging to what, do pleasure and pain arise internally?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One….”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“When there is the eye, bhikkhus, by clinging to the eye, pleasure and pain arise internally. When there is the ear … the mind, by clinging to the mind, pleasure and pain arise internally.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“What do you think, bhikkhus, is the eye permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p>“Impermanent, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?”</p>
<p>“Suffering, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“But without clinging to what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, could pleasure and pain arise internally?”</p>
<p>“No, venerable sir.” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.86"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Is the ear … the mind permanent or impermanent?… But without clinging to what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, could pleasure and pain arise internally?”</p>
<p>“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards the eye … the mind. Experiencing revulsion, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion <span class="add">his mind</span> is liberated. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It’s liberated.’ He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’”</p>
