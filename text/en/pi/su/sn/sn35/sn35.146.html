<h1>146. Kamma</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, I will teach you new and old kamma, the cessation of kamma, and the way leading to the cessation of kamma. Listen to that and attend closely, I will speak….</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is old kamma? The eye is old kamma, to be seen as generated and fashioned by volition, as something to be felt. The ear is old kamma … The mind is old kamma, to be seen as generated and fashioned by volition, as something to be felt. This is called old kamma.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“And what, bhikkhus is new kamma? Whatever action one does now by body, speech, or mind. This is called new kamma.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the cessation of kamma? When one reaches liberation through the cessation of bodily action, verbal action, and mental action, <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.133"></a> this is called the cessation of kamma.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the way leading to the cessation of kamma? It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Thus, bhikkhus, I have taught old kamma, I have taught new kamma, I have taught the cessation of kamma, I have taught the way leading to the cessation of kamma. Whatever should be done, bhikkhus, by a compassionate teacher out of compassion for his disciples, desiring their welfare, that I have done for you. These are the feet of trees, bhikkhus, these are empty huts. Meditate, bhikkhus, do not be negligent, lest you regret it later. This is our instruction to you.”</p>
