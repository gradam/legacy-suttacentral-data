<h1>28. Partaking of Penetration</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the path that partakes of penetration. Listen to that….</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the path that partakes of penetration? It is: the seven factors of enlightenment. What seven? The enlightenment factor of mindfulness … the enlightenment factor of equanimity.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>When this was said, the Venerable Udayī asked the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, how are the seven factors of enlightenment developed and cultivated so that they lead to penetration?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Here, Udayī, a bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release; which is vast, exalted, <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.88"></a> measureless, without ill will. With a mind that has developed the enlightenment factor of mindfulness, he penetrates and sunders the mass of greed that he has never before penetrated and sundered; he penetrates and sunders the mass of hatred that he has never before penetrated and sundered; he penetrates and sunders the mass of delusion that he has never before penetrated and sundered….</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“He develops the enlightenment factor of equanimity, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release; which is vast, exalted, measureless, without ill will. With a mind that has developed the enlightenment factor of equanimity, he penetrates and sunders the mass of greed ... the mass of hatred ... the mass of delusion that he has never before penetrated and sundered.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“It is, Udayī, when the seven factors of enlightenment are developed and cultivated in this way that they lead to penetration.”</p>
