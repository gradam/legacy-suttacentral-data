<h1>64. In Conceiving</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthi. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One … and said to him: <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iii.75"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief….”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Bhikkhu, in conceiving one is bound by Mara; by not conceiving one is freed from the Evil One.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Understood, Blessed One! Understood, Fortunate One!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“In what way, bhikkhu, do you understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by me in brief?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“In conceiving form, venerable sir, one is bound by Mara; by not conceiving it one is freed from the Evil One. In conceiving feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness one is bound by Mara; by not conceiving it one is freed from the Evil One.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“It is in such a way, venerable sir, that I understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by the Blessed One in brief.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“Good, good, bhikkhu! It is good that you understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by me in brief. In conceiving form, bhikkhu, one is bound by Mara … <span class="supplied">as above in full</span> … by not conceiving it one is freed from the Evil One. It is in such a way that the meaning of what was stated by me in brief should be understood in detail.”</p>
<p>… And that bhikkhu became one of the arahants.</p>
