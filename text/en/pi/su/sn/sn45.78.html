<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other thing by means of which the unarisen Noble Eightfold Path arises and the arisen Noble Eightfold Path goes to fulfilment by development so effectively as by this: accomplishment in virtue ... accomplishment in desire … accomplishment in self ... accomplishment in view ... accomplishment in diligence … accomplishment in careful attention … <span class="supplied">complete as in §77</span> … He develops right concentration, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu who is accomplished in careful attention develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path.” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.37"></a></p>
