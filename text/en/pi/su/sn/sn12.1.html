<h1>1. Dependent Origination</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Bhikkhus, I will teach you dependent origination. Listen to that and attend closely, I will speak.”–“Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is dependent origination? With ignorance as condition, volitional formations <span class="supplied">come to be</span>; with volitional formations as condition, consciousness; with consciousness as condition, name-and-form; with name-and-form as condition, the six sense bases; with the six sense bases as condition, contact; with contact as condition, feeling; with feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging; with clinging as condition, existence; with existence as condition, birth; with birth as condition, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair come to be. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. This, bhikkhus, is called dependent origination.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations; <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.2"></a> with the cessation of volitional formations, cessation of consciousness; with the cessation of consciousness, cessation of name-and-form; with the cessation of name-and-form, cessation of the six sense bases; with the cessation of the six sense bases, cessation of contact; with the cessation of contact, cessation of feeling; with the cessation of feeling, cessation of craving; with the cessation of craving, cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging, cessation of existence; with the cessation of existence, cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One’s statement.</p>
