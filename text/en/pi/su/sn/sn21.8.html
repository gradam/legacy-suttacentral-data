<h1>8. Nanda</h1>

<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthi. Then the Venerable Nanda, the Blessed One’s maternal cousin, put on well-pressed and well-ironed robes, painted his eyes, took a glazed bowl, and approached the Blessed One. Having paid homage to the Blessed One, he sat down to one side, and the Blessed One said to him:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Nanda, this is not proper for you, a clansman who has gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness, that you wear well-pressed and well-ironed robes, paint your eyes, and carry a glazed bowl. This is proper for you, Nanda, a clansman who has gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness, that you be a forest dweller, an almsfood eater, a rag-robes wearer, and that you dwell indifferent to sensual pleasures.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>This is what the Blessed One said … <span class="supplied">who</span> further said this:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“When shall I see Nanda as a forest dweller,<br>
Wearing robes stitched from rags,<br>
Subsisting on the scraps of strangers,<br>
Indifferent towards sensual pleasures?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>Then, some time later, the Venerable Nanda became a forest dweller, an almsfood eater, a rag-robes wearer, and he dwelt indifferent to sensual pleasures.</p>
