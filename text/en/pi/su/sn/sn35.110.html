<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the things that can be clung to and the clinging. Listen to that….</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, are the things that can be clung to, and what is the clinging? The eye, bhikkhus, is a thing that can be clung to; the desire and lust for it is the clinging there. The ear is a thing that can be clung to … The mind is a thing that can be clung to; the desire and lust for it is the clinging there. These are called the things that can be clung to, and this the clinging.”</p>
