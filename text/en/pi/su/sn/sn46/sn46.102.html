<p>Kindred Sayings on the Limbs of Wisdom</p>
<p>Rukkha Suttaṃ</p>
<h1>102. The Tree</h1>
</div>
<h2>i. Seclusion</h2>
<p>Thus have I heard:</p>
<p>Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>
<p>Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks.”</p>
<p>“Yes, lord,” replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>
<p>The Exalted One said:</p>
<p>“Suppose a tree, monks, that inclines to the east, slopes to the east, tends to the east.</p>
<p>When cut down at the root, in what direction would it fall?”</p>
<p>“As it slopes, as it inclines, as it tends, lord.”</p>
<p>“Well, monks, even so a monk, cultivating and makng much of the seven limbs of wisdom, inclines to Nibbāna,, slopes to Nibbāna,, tends to Nibbāna,.</p>
<p>And how does a monk, cultivating and makng much of the seven limbs of wisdom, incline to Nibbāna,, slope to Nibbāna,, tend to Nibbāna,?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>That is how a monk, cultivating and makng much of the seven limbs of wisdom, inclines to Nibbāna, slopes to Nibbāna, tends to Nibbāna,.</p>
<h2>ii. Ending in Restraint of Passion</h2>
<p>“Suppose a tree, monks, that inclines to the east, slopes to the east, tends to the east.</p>
<p>When cut down at the root, in what direction would it fall?”</p>
<p>“As it slopes, as it inclines, as it tends, lord.”</p>
<p>“Well, monks, even so a monk, cultivating and makng much of the seven limbs of wisdom, inclines to Nibbāna, slopes to Nibbāna, tends to Nibbāna.</p>
<p>And how does a monk, cultivating and makng much of the seven limbs of wisdom, incline to Nibbāna, slope to Nibbāna, tend to Nibbāna?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivatesthe limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>That is how a monk, cultivating and makng much of the seven limbs of wisdom, inclines to Nibbāna, slopes to Nibbāna, tends to Nibbāna.</p>
<h2>iii. Ending in the Deathless</h2>
<p>“Suppose a tree, monks, that inclines to the east, slopes to the east, tends to the east.</p>
<p>When cut down at the root, in what direction would it fall?”</p>
<p>“As it slopes, as it inclines, as it tends, lord.”</p>
<p>“Well, monks, even so a monk, cultivating and makng much of the seven limbs of wisdom, inclines to Nibbāna, slopes to Nibbāna, tends to Nibbāna.</p>
<p>And how does a monk, cultivating and makng much of the seven limbs of wisdom, incline to Nibbāna, slope to Nibbāna, tend to Nibbāna?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end.</p>
<p>That is how a monk, cultivating and makng much of the seven limbs of wisdom, inclines to Nibbāna, slopes to Nibbāna, tends to Nibbāna.</p>
<h2>iv. Ending in Nibbāna</h2>
<p>“Suppose a tree, monks, that inclines to the east, slopes to the east, tends to the east.</p>
<p>When cut down at the root, in what direction would it fall?”</p>
<p>“As it slopes, as it inclines, as it tends, lord.”</p>
<p>“Well, monks, even so a monk, cultivating and makng much of the seven limbs of wisdom, inclines to Nibbāna, slopes to Nibbāna, tends to Nibbāna.</p>
<p>And how does a monk, cultivating and makng much of the seven limbs of wisdom, incline to Nibbāna, slope to Nibbāna, tend to Nibbāna?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna.</p>
<p>That is how a monk, cultivating and makng much of the seven limbs of wisdom, inclines to Nibbāna, slopes to Nibbāna, tends to Nibbāna.</p>
