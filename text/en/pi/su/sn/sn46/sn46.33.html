<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these five corruptions of gold, corrupted by which gold is neither malleable nor wieldy nor radiant but brittle and not properly fit for work. What five? Iron is a corruption of gold, corrupted by which gold is neither malleable nor wieldy nor radiant but brittle and not properly fit for work. Copper is a corruption of gold ... Tin is a corruption of gold ... Lead is a corruption of gold ... Silver is a corruption of gold.… These are the five corruptions of gold, corrupted by which gold is neither malleable nor wieldy nor radiant but brittle and not properly fit for work.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“So too, bhikkhus, there are these five corruptions of the mind, corrupted by which the mind is neither malleable nor wieldy nor radiant but brittle and not rightly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. What five? Sensual desire is a corruption of the mind, corrupted by which the mind is neither malleable nor wieldy nor radiant but brittle and not rightly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. <span class="supplied">Ill will is a corruption of the mind ... Sloth and torpor are a corruption of the mind ... Restlessness and remorse are a corruption of the mind ... Doubt is a corruption of the mind....</span> <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.93"></a> These are the five corruptions of the mind, corrupted by which the mind is neither malleable nor wieldy nor radiant but brittle and not rightly concentrated for the destruction of the taints.”</p>
