<h1>18. Discourse on the Neglected and Undertaken</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw1"></a>Thus have I heard:</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw2"></a>Once the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw3"></a>“Monks.”</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw4"></a>“Yes, lord,” replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw5"></a>The Exalted One said:</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw6"></a>“By whomsoever, monks, the seven limbs of wisdom are neglected, by them is neglected this Ariyan eightfold way for the utter destruction of ill.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw7"></a>By whomsoever, monks, the seven limbs of wisdom are undertaken, by them is undertaken this Ariyan eightfold way for the utter destruction of ill.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw8"></a>What are the seven?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw9"></a>The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br>
the limb of wisdom that is Norm investigation,<br>
the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br>
the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br>
the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br>
the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br>
the limb of wisdom that is equanimity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw10"></a>By whomsoever, monks, the seven limbs of wisdom are neglected, by them is neglected this Ariyan eightfold way for the utter destruction of ill.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw11"></a>By whomsoever, monks, the seven limbs of wisdom are undertaken, by them is undertaken this Ariyan eightfold way for the utter destruction of ill.”</p>
