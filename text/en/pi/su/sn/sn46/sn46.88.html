<p>Kindred Sayings on the Limbs of Wisdom</p>

<p>Thus have I heard:</p>
<p>Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>
<p>Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks.”</p>
<p>“Yes, lord,” replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>
<p>The Exalted One said:</p>
<p>“Just as, monks, whatsoever great rivers there be, such as the Ganges,
<i>Yamunā, Acīravatī, Sarabhū and Mahī,</i> all of them flow, slide and tend to the East, even so a monk who cultivates and makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom flows, slides, tends to Nibbāna.</p>
<p>And how, monks, by cultivating and making much of the seven limbs of wisdom does a monk flow, slide and tend to Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>Thus cultivating, thus making much of the seven limbs of wisdom a monk flows, slides and tends to Nibbāna.”</p>
