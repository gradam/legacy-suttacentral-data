<h1>107. The Rain-Cloud</h1>
</div>
<h2>i. Seclusion</h2>
<p>Thus have I heard:</p>
<p>Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>
<p>Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks.”</p>
<p>“Yes, lord,” replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>
<p>The Exalted One said:</p>
<p>“Just as, monks, from time to time a strong wind scatters and causes to vanish a great mass of clouds that has arisen, even so a monk who cultivates and makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom from time to time scatters and causes to vanish the ill, unprofitable states that rise and rise again.</p>
<p>And how does a monk who cultivates and makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom from time to time scatter and cause to vanish the ill, unprofitable states that rise and rise again?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>That is how monks, when a monk cultivates the seven limbs of wisdom, makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom, from time to time scatters and causes to vanish the ill, unprofitable states that rise and rise again.</p>
<h2>ii. Ending in Restraint of Passion</h2>
<p>“Just as, monks, from time to time a strong wind scatters and causes to vanish a great mass of clouds that has arisen, even so a monk who cultivates and makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom from time to time scatters and causes to vanish the ill, unprofitable states that rise and rise again.</p>
<p>And how does a monk who cultivates and makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom from time to time scatter and cause to vanish the ill, unprofitable states that rise and rise again?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>That is how monks, when a monk cultivates the seven limbs of wisdom, makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom, from time to time scatters and causes to vanish the ill, unprofitable states that rise and rise again.</p>
<h2>iii. Ending in the Deathless</h2>
<p>“Just as, monks, from time to time a strong wind scatters and causes to vanish a great mass of clouds that has arisen, even so a monk who cultivates and makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom from time to time scatters and causes to vanish the ill, unprofitable states that rise and rise again.</p>
<p>And how does a monk who cultivates and makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom from time to time scatter and cause to vanish the ill, unprofitable states that rise and rise again?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end.</p>
<p>That is how monks, when a monk cultivates the seven limbs of wisdom, makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom, from time to time scatters and causes to vanish the ill, unprofitable states that rise and rise again.</p>
<h2>iv. Ending in Nibbāna</h2>
<p>“Just as, monks, from time to time a strong wind scatters and causes to vanish a great mass of clouds that has arisen, even so a monk who cultivates and makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom from time to time scatters and causes to vanish the ill, unprofitable states that rise and rise again.</p>
<p>And how does a monk who cultivates and makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom from time to time scatter and cause to vanish the ill, unprofitable states that rise and rise again?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna.</p>
<p>That is how monks, when a monk cultivates the seven limbs of wisdom, makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom, from time to time scatters and causes to vanish the ill, unprofitable states that rise and rise again.</p>
