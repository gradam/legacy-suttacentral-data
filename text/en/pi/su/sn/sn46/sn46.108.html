<p>Kindred Sayings on the Limbs of Wisdom</p>
<p>Nāvā Suttaṃ</p>
<h1>108. The Ship</h1>
</div>
<h2>i. Seclusion</h2>
<p>Thus have I heard:</p>
<p>Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>
<p>Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks.”</p>
<p>“Yes, lord,” replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>
<p>The Exalted One said:</p>
<p>“Just as, monks, in the case of a sea-faring vessel rigged with masts and stays and stranded on the bank, for six months it is worn by the water, while in the dry season its rigging is spoiled by wind and sun: then, overstrung by a shower in the rainy season, it is easily weakened and rots away; just so, in a monk who cultivates and makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom right easily the fetters are weakened and rot away.</p>
<p>And how, monks, in one so cultivating and making much of the seven limbs of wisdom are the fetters weakened and rot away?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>That is how monks, in one so cultivating and making much of the seven limbs of wisdom the fetters are weakened and rot away.</p>
<h2>ii. Ending in Restraint of Passion</h2>
<p>“Just as, monks, in the case of a sea-faring vessel rigged with masts and stays and stranded on the bank, for six months it is worn by the water, while in the dry season its rigging is spoiled by wind and sun: then, overstrung by a shower in the rainy season, it is easily weakened and rots away; just so, in a monk who cultivates and makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom right easily the fetters are weakened and rot away.</p>
<p>And how, monks, in one so cultivating and making much of the seven limbs of wisdom are the fetters weakened and rot away?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>That is how monks, in one so cultivating and making much of the seven limbs of wisdom the fetters are weakened and rot away.</p>
<h2>iii. Ending in the Deathless</h2>
<p>“Just as, monks, in the case of a sea-faring vessel rigged with masts and stays and stranded on the bank, for six months it is worn by the water, while in the dry season its rigging is spoiled by wind and sun: then, overstrung by a shower in the rainy season, it is easily weakened and rots away; just so, in a monk who cultivates and makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom right easily the fetters are weakened and rot away.</p>
<p>And how, monks, in one so cultivating and making much of the seven limbs of wisdom are the fetters weakened and rot away?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end.</p>
<p>That is how monks, in one so cultivating and making much of the seven limbs of wisdom the fetters are weakened and rot away.</p>
<h2>iv. Ending in Nibbāna</h2>
<p>“Just as, monks, in the case of a sea-faring vessel rigged with masts and stays and stranded on the bank, for six months it is worn by the water, while in the dry season its rigging is spoiled by wind and sun: then, overstrung by a shower in the rainy season, it is easily weakened and rots away; just so, in a monk who cultivates and makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom right easily the fetters are weakened and rot away.</p>
<p>And how, monks, in one so cultivating and making much of the seven limbs of wisdom are the fetters weakened and rot away?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna.</p>
<p>That is how monks, in one so cultivating and making much of the seven limbs of wisdom the fetters are weakened and rot away.</p>
