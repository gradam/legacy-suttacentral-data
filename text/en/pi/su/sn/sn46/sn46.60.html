<h1>60. The Fissured</h1>
</div>
<h2>I. Great the Fruit and Great the Profit</h2>
<p>Thus have I heard:</p>
<p>Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>
<p>Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>"Monks."</p>
<p>"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>
<p>The Exalted One said:</p>
<p>"Monks, the idea of the fissured corpse, if cultivated and made much of, is of great fruit and great profit.</p>
<p>And how cultivated and made much of is the idea of the fissured corpse of great fruit and great profit?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, accompanied by the idea of the fissured corpse, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm, accompanied by the idea of the fissured corpse, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, accompanied by the idea of the fissured corpse, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest, accompanied by the idea of the fissured corpse, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, accompanied by the idea of the fissured corpse, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration, accompanied by the idea of the fissured corpse, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity, accompanied by the idea of the fissured corpse, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>Thus cultivated, monks, thus made much of, the idea of the fissured corpse is of great fruit and great profit."</p>
<h2>II. Realization or No Return</h2>
<p>Monks, from the cultivation and making much of the idea of the fissured corpse, of two fruits one may be looked for even in this very life, to wit: realization, or, if there be any substrate left, the state of non-return.</p>
<p>How should it be cultivated, monks, how should it be made much of that of two fruits one may be looked for even in this very life, to wit: realization, or, if there be any substrate left, the state of non-return?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, accompanied by the idea of the fissured corpse, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm, accompanied by the idea of the fissured corpse, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
