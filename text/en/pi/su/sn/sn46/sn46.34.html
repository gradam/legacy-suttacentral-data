<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, these seven factors of enlightenment are nonobstructions, nonhindrances, noncorruptions of the mind; when developed and cultivated they lead to the realization of the fruit of true knowledge and liberation. What seven? The enlightenment factor of mindfulness, bhikkhus, is a nonobstruction … The enlightenment factor of equanimity is a nonobstruction, a nonhindrance, a noncorruption of the mind; when developed and cultivated it leads to the realization of the fruit of true knowledge and liberation. These seven factors of enlightenment are nonobstructions, nonhindrances, noncorruptions of the mind; when developed and cultivated they lead to the realization of the fruit of true knowledge and liberation.”</p>
