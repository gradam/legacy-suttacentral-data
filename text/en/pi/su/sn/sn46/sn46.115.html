<h1>115. Suffering</h1>
</div>
<h2>a. Full Comprehension</h2>
<p>Thus have I heard:</p>
<p>Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>
<p>Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks.”</p>
<p>“Yes, lord,” replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>
<p>The Exalted One said:</p>
<p>“Monks, there are these three forms of suffering.</p>
<p>What three?</p>
<p>The sort of suffering caused by pain, the sort caused by the activities, the sort of suffering caused by the changeable nature of things.</p>
<p>These are the three.</p>
<p>It is for the full comprehension of these three forms of suffering monks, that the seven limbs of wisdom is to be cultivated.</p>
<p>What seven limbs of wisdom?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
