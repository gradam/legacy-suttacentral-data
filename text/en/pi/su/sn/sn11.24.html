<h1>24. Transgression</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthī. Now on that occasion two bhikkhus had a quarrel and one bhikkhu had transgressed against the other. Then the former bhikkhu confessed his transgression to the other bhikkhu, but the latter would not pardon him.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported to him what had happened. <span class="supplied">The Blessed One said:</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are two kinds of fools: one who does not see a transgression as a transgression; and one who, when another is confessing a transgression, does not pardon him in accordance with the Dhamma. These are the two kinds of fools.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“There are, bhikkhus, two kinds of wise people: one who sees a transgression as a transgression; and one who, when another is confessing a transgression, pardons him in accordance with the Dhamma. These are the two kinds of wise people.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Once in the past, bhikkhus, Sakka, lord of the devas, instructing the Tavatiṃsa devas in the Sudhamma assembly hall, on that occasion recited this verse: <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.i.240"></a></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a> “‘Bring anger under your control;<br>
Do not let your friendships decay.<br>
Do not blame one who is blameless;<br>
Do not utter divisive speech.<br>
Like a mountain avalanche<br>
Anger crushes evil people.’”</p>
