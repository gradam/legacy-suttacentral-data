<h1>118. Sakka’s Questin</h1>

<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Then Sakka, lord of the devas, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Venerable sir, what is the cause and reason <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.102"></a> why some beings here do not attain Nibbāna in this very life? And what is the cause and reason why some beings here attain Nibbāna in this very life?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“There are, lord of the devas, forms cognizable by the eye that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. If a bhikkhu seeks delight in them, welcomes them, and remains holding to them, his consciousness becomes dependent upon them and clings to them. A bhikkhu with clinging does not attain Nibbāna.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“There are, lord of the devas, sounds cognizable by the ear ... mental phenomena cognizable by the mind that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. If a bhikkhu seeks delight in them, welcomes them, and remains holding to them, his consciousness becomes dependent upon them and clings to them. A bhikkhu with clinging does not attain Nibbāna.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“This is the cause and reason, lord of the devas, why some beings here do not attain Nibbāna in this very life.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“There are, lord of the devas, forms cognizable by the eye ... mental phenomena cognizable by the mind that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. If a bhikkhu does not seek delight in them, does not welcome them, and does not remain holding to them, his consciousness does not become dependent upon them or cling to them. A bhikkhu without clinging attains Nibbāna.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“This is the cause and reason, lord of the devas, why some beings here attain Nibbāna in this very life.” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.103"></a></p>
