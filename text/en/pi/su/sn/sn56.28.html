<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, these are these Four Noble Truths. What four? The noble truth of suffering, the noble truth of the origin of suffering, the noble truth of the cessation of suffering, the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering. In this world, with its devas, Mara, and Brahma, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, the Tathagata is the noble one. Therefore they are called noble truths.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Therefore, bhikkhus, an exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is suffering.’… An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.436"></a></p>
