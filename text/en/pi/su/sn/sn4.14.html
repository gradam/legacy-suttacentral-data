<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Kosalans at the brahmin village of Ekasala. Now on that occasion the Blessed One was teaching the Dhamma surrounded by a large assembly of laypeople.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Then it occurred to Mara the Evil One: “This ascetic Gotama is teaching the Dhamma while surrounded by a large assembly of laypeople. Let me approach the ascetic Gotama in order to confound them.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>Then Mara the Evil One approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a> “This is not suitable for you,<br>
That you instruct others.<br>
When so engaged don’t get caught<br>
In attraction and repulsion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="supplied">The Blessed One:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a> “Compassionate for their welfare,<br>
The Buddha instructs others.<br>
The Tathagata is fully released<br>
From attraction and repulsion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Mara the Evil One … disappeared right there.</p>
