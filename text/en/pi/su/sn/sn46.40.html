<h1>40. Hindrances</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, these five hindrances are makers of blindness, causing lack of vision, causing lack of knowledge, detrimental to wisdom, tending to vexation, leading away from Nibbāna. What five? The hindrance of sensual desire is a maker of blindness … The hindrance of ill will … The hindrance of sloth and torpor ... The hindrance of restlessness and remorse … The hindrance of doubt is a maker of blindness … leading away from Nibbāna. These five hindrances are makers of blindness, causing lack of vision, causing lack of knowledge, detrimental to wisdom, tending to vexation, leading away from Nibbāna.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“These seven factors of enlightenment, bhikkhus, are makers of vision, makers of knowledge, promoting the growth of wisdom, free from vexation, leading towards Nibbāna. What seven? The enlightenment factor of mindfulness is a maker of vision ... The enlightenment factor of equanimity is a maker of vision ... leading towards Nibbāna. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.98"></a> These seven factors of enlightenment are makers of vision, makers of knowledge, promoting the growth of wisdom, free from vexation, leading towards Nibbāna.”</p>
