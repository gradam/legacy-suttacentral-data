The Blessed One saw him coming in the distance and addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus, this clansman is beautiful in both respects. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.279"></a> He is handsome, good-looking, pleasing to behold, possessing supreme beauty of complexion. And he is one who, by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life enters and dwells in that unsurpassed goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>This is what the Blessed One said … <span class="supplied">who</span> further said this:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“This bhikkhu shines with sublime beauty,<br>
Having a mind utterly straight.<br>
Detached is he, free from fetters,<br>
Attained to Nibbāna by nonclinging.<br>
He carries about his final body,<br>
Having conquered Mara and his mount.”</p>
