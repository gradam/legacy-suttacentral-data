<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthi. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iii.27"></a> “Bhikkhus, I will teach you things that should be fully understood and also full understanding. Listen to that….</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, are the things that should be fully understood? Form, bhikkhus, is something that should be fully understood; feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness is something that should be fully understood. These are called the things that should be fully understood.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is full understanding? The destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of delusion. This is called full understanding.”</p>
