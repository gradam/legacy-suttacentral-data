<h1>31. The Root of Misery</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthi. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you misery and the root of misery. Listen to that….</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is misery? Form is misery; feeling is misery; perception is misery; volitional formations are misery; consciousness is misery. This is called misery.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the root of misery? It is this craving that leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here and there; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for existence, craving for extermination. This is called the root of misery.”</p>
