As to those ascetics and brahmins who do not understand birth … existence … clinging … craving ... feeling ... contact ... the six sense bases … name-and-form … consciousness … volitional formations, their origin, their cessation, and the way leading to their cessation: it is impossible that they will abide having transcended volitional formations.</p>
