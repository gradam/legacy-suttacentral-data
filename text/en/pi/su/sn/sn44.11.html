<h1>11. Sabhiya Kaccana</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>On one occasion the Venerable Sabhiya Kaccana was dwelling at Ñatika in the Brick Hall. Then the wanderer Vacchagotta approached the Venerable Sabhiya Kaccana and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to him:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“How is it, Master Kaccana, does the Tathagata exist after death?”</p>
<p><span class="supplied">All as in §1 down to:</span> <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.402"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“What then, Master Kaccana, is the cause and reason why this has not been declared by the Blessed One?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Vaccha, as to the cause and condition for describing him as ‘consisting of form’ or as ‘formless’ or as ‘percipient’ or as ‘nonpercipient’ or as ‘neither percipient nor nonpercipient’: if that cause and condition were to cease completely and totally without remainder, in what way could one describe him as ‘consisting of form’ or as ‘formless’ or as ‘percipient’ or as ‘nonpercipient’ or as ‘neither percipient nor nonpercipient’?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“How long has it been since you went forth, Master Kaccana?”</p>
<p>“Not long, friend. Three years.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“One, friend, who has gotten so much in such a time has indeed gotten much, not to speak of one who has surpassed this!” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.403"></a></p>
