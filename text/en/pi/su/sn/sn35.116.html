<h1>116. Going to the End of the World</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, I say that the end of the world cannot be known, seen, or reached by travelling. Yet, bhikkhus, I also say that without reaching the end of the world there is no making an end to suffering.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Having said this, the Blessed One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling. Then, soon after the Blessed One had left, the bhikkhus considered: “Now, friends, the Blessed One has risen from his seat and entered his dwelling after reciting a synopsis in brief without expounding the meaning in detail. Now who will expound in detail the meaning of the synopsis that the Blessed One recited in brief?” Then they considered: “The Venerable Ananda is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise brothers in the holy life; the Venerable Ananda is capable of expounding in detail the meaning of this synopsis recited in brief by the Blessed One without expounding the meaning in detail. Let us approach him and ask him the meaning of this.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>Then those bhikkhus approached the Venerable Ananda and exchanged greetings with him, after which they sat down to one side and told him what had taken place, <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.94"></a> adding: “Let the Venerable Ananda expound it to us.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><span class="add show">The Venerable Ananda replied:</span> “Friends, it is as though a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, would pass over the root and trunk of a great tree standing possessed of heartwood, thinking that heartwood should be sought among the branches and foliage. And so it is with you venerable ones: when you were face to face with the Teacher you passed by the Blessed One, thinking that I should be asked about the meaning. For, friends, knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he sees; he has become vision, he has become knowledge, he has become the Dhamma, he has become the holy one; he is the expounder, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the giver of the Deathless, the lord of the Dhamma, the Tathagata. That was the time when you should have asked the Blessed One the meaning. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.95"></a> As he explained it to you, so you should have remembered it.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Surely, friend Ananda, knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he sees; he has become vision ... the Tathagata. That was the time when we should have asked the Blessed One the meaning, and as he explained it to us, so we should have remembered it. Yet the Venerable Ananda is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise brothers in the holy life; the Venerable Ananda is capable of expounding the detailed meaning of this synopsis recited in brief by the Blessed One without expounding the meaning in detail. Let the Venerable Ananda expound it without finding it troublesome.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Then listen, friends, and attend closely to what I shall say.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“Yes, friend,” the bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Ananda said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“Friends, when the Blessed One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling after reciting a synopsis in brief without expounding the meaning in detail, that is: ‘Bhikkhus, I say that the end of the world cannot be known, seen, or reached by travelling. Yet, bhikkhus, I also say that without reaching the end of the world there is no making an end to suffering,’ I understand the detailed meaning of this synopsis as follows: That in the world by which one is a perceiver of the world, a conceiver of the world—this is called the world in the Noble One’s Discipline. And what, friends, is that in the world by which one is a perceiver of the world, a conceiver of the world? The eye is that in the world by which one is a perceiver of the world, a conceiver of the world . The ear ... The nose ... The tongue ... The body ... The mind is that in the world by which one is a perceiver of the world, a conceiver of the world. That in the world by which one is a perceiver of the world, a conceiver of the world—this is called the world in the Noble One’s Discipline. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.96"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“Friends, when the Blessed One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling after reciting a synopsis in brief without expounding the meaning in detail, that is: ‘Bhikkhus, I say that the end of the world cannot be known, seen, or reached by travelling. Yet, bhikkhus, I also say that without reaching the end of the world there is no making an end to suffering,’ I understand the meaning of this synopsis in detail to be thus. Now, friends, if you wish, go to the Blessed One and ask him about the meaning of this. As the Blessed One explains it to you, so you should remember it.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>“Yes, friends,” those bhikkhus replied, and having risen from their seats, they went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, they sat down to one side and told the Blessed One all that had taken place after he had left, adding: <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.97"></a> “Then, venerable sir, we approached the Venerable Ananda and asked him about the meaning. The Venerable Ananda expounded the meaning to us in these ways, with these terms, with these phrases.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>“Ananda is wise, bhikkhus, Ananda has great wisdom. If you had asked me the meaning of this, I would have explained it to you in the same way that it has been explained by Ananda. Such is the meaning of this, and so you should remember it.”</p>
