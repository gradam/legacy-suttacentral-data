<p>“A monk endowed with six qualities is incapable of realizing the unexcelled cooled state. Which six? There is the case where a monk doesn’t rein in his mind when it should be reined in. He doesn’t exert his mind when it should be exerted. He doesn’t gladden his mind when it should be gladdened. He doesn’t watch over his mind when it should be watched over. He is intent on what is lowly. And he delights in self-identity. A monk endowed with these six qualities is incapable of realizing the unexcelled cooled state.</p>
<p>“A monk endowed with six qualities is capable of realizing the unexcelled cooled state. Which six? There is the case where a monk reins in his mind when it should be reined in. He exerts his mind when it should be exerted. He gladdens his mind when it should be gladdened. He watches over his mind when it should be watched over. He is intent on what is exquisite. And he delights in Unbinding. A monk endowed with these six qualities is capable of realizing the unexcelled cooled state.”</p>
