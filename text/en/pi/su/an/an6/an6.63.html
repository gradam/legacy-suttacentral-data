<h2>1.</h2>
<p>“‘Sensuality should be known. The cause of sensuality… The diversity in sensuality… The result of sensuality… The cessation of sensuality… The path of practice for the cessation of sensuality should be known.’ Thus it has been said. In reference to what was it said?</p>
<p>“There are these five strings of sensuality. Which five? Forms cognizable via the eye—agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing; sounds cognizable via the ear… aromas cognizable via the nose… flavors cognizable via the tongue… tactile sensations cognizable via the body—agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing. But these are not sensuality. They are called strings of sensuality in the discipline of the noble ones.</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>The passion for his resolves is a man's sensuality,<br>
not the beautiful sensual pleasures found in the world.<br>
The passion for his resolves is a man's sensuality.</p>
<p>The beauties remain as they are in the world,<br>
while the wise, in this regard,<br>
subdue their desire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“And what is the cause of sensuality? Contact is the cause of sensuality.</p>
<p>“And what is the diversity in sensuality? Sensuality with regard to forms is one thing, sensuality with regard to sounds is another, sensuality with regard to aromas is another, sensuality with regard to flavors is another, sensuality with regard to tactile sensations is another. This is called the diversity in sensuality.</p>
<p>“And what is the result of sensuality? One who wants sensuality produces a corresponding state of existence, on the side of merit or demerit. This is called the result of sensuality.</p>
<p>“And what is the cessation of sensuality? From the cessation of contact is the cessation of sensuality; and just this noble eightfold path—right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right samādhi—is the way leading to the cessation of sensuality.</p>
<p>“Now when a disciple of the noble ones discerns sensuality in this way, the cause of sensuality in this way, the diversity of sensuality in this way, the result of sensuality in this way, the cessation of sensuality in this way, and the path of practice leading to the cessation of sensuality in this way, then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of sensuality.</p>
<p>“‘Sensuality should be known. The cause of sensuality… The diversity in sensuality… The result of sensuality… The cessation of sensuality… The path of practice for the cessation of sensuality should be known.’ Thus it has been said, and in reference to this was it said.</p>

<p>“‘Feeling should be known. The cause of feeling… The diversity in feeling… The result of feeling… The cessation of feeling… The path of practice for the cessation of feeling should be known.’ Thus it has been said. In reference to what was it said?</p>
<p>“There are these three kinds of feeling: a feeling of pleasure, a feeling of pain, and feeling of neither pleasure nor pain.</p>
<p>“And what is the cause of feeling? Contact is the cause of feeling.</p>
<p>“And what is the diversity in feeling? There is the feeling of pleasure connected with the baits of the world. There is the feeling of pleasure not connected with the baits of the world. There is the feeling of pain connected with the baits of the world. There is the feeling of pain not connected with the baits of the world. There is the feeling of neither pleasure nor pain connected with the baits of the world. There is the feeling of neither pleasure nor pain not connected with the baits of the world. This is called the diversity in feeling.</p>
<p>“And what is the result of feeling? One who feels a feeling produces a corresponding state of existence, on the side of merit or demerit. This is called the result of feeling.</p>
<p>“And what is the cessation of feeling? From the cessation of contact is the cessation of feeling; and just this noble eightfold path—right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right samādhi—is the way leading to the cessation of feeling.</p>
<p>“Now when a disciple of the noble ones discerns feeling in this way, the cause of feeling in this way, the diversity of feeling in this way, the result of feeling in this way, the cessation of feeling in this way, and the path of practice leading to the cessation of feeling in this way, then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of feeling.</p>

<p>“There are these six kinds of perception: the perception of form, the perception of sound, the perception of aroma, the perception of flavor, the perception of tactile sensation, the perception of ideas.</p>

This is called the diversity in perception.</p>
<p>“And what is the result of perception? Perception has expression as its result, I tell you. However a person perceives something, that is how he expresses it: 'I have this sort of perception.’ This is called the result of perception.</p>
<p>“And what is the cessation of perception? From the cessation of contact is the cessation of perception; and just this noble eightfold path—right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right samādhi—is the way leading to the cessation of perception.</p>
<p>“Now when a disciple of the noble ones discerns perception in this way, the cause of perception in this way, the diversity of perception in this way, the result of perception in this way, the cessation of perception in this way, and the path of practice leading to the cessation of perception in this way, then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of perception.</p>

<p>“And what is the cause of defilements? Ignorance is the cause of defilements.</p>
<p>“And what is the diversity in defilements? There are defilements that lead to hell, those that lead to the animal womb, those that lead to the realm of the hungry shades, those that lead to the human world, those that lead to the world of the devas. This is called the diversity in defilements.</p>
<p>“And what is the result of defilements? One who is immersed in ignorance produces a corresponding state of existence, on the side of merit or demerit. This is called the result of defilements.</p>
<p>“And what is the cessation of defilements? From the cessation of ignorance is the cessation of defilements; and just this noble eightfold path—right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right samādhi—is the way leading to the cessation of defilements.</p>

<p>“Intention, I tell you, is kamma. Intending, one does kamma by way of body, speech, and intellect.</p>
<p>“And what is the cause of kamma? Contact is the cause of kamma.</p>
<p>“And what is the diversity in kamma? There is kamma to be experienced in hell, kamma to be experienced in the realm of common animals, kamma to be experienced in the realm of the hungry shades, kamma to be experienced in the human world, kamma to be experienced in the world of the devas. This is called the diversity in kamma.</p>
<p>“And what is the result of kamma? The result of kamma is of three sorts, I tell you: that which arises right here &amp; now, that which arises later [in this lifetime], and that which arises following that. This is called the result of kamma.</p>
<p>“And what is the cessation of kamma? From the cessation of contact is the cessation of kamma; and just this noble eightfold path—right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right samādhi—is the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma.</p>

<p>“And what is the diversity in suffering? There is major suffering and minor, slowly fading and quickly fading. This is called the diversity in suffering.</p>
<p>“And what is the result of suffering? There are some cases in which a person overcome with pain, his mind exhausted, grieves, mourns, laments, beats his breast, and becomes bewildered. Or one overcome with pain, his mind exhausted, comes to search outside, 'Who knows a way or two to stop this pain?’ I tell you, monks, that suffering results either in bewilderment or in search. This is called the result of suffering.</p>
<p>“And what is the cessation of suffering? From the cessation of craving is the cessation of suffering; and just this noble eightfold path—right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right samādhi—is the path of practice leading to the cessation of suffering.</p>
