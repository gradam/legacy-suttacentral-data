<h1>49. With Khema</h1>
</div>
<p>On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s monastery. And at that time Ven. Khema and Ven. Sumana were staying near Savatthi in the Blind Man’s Grove. Then Ven. Khema and Ven. Sumana went to the Blessed One and on arrival, have bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, Ven. Khema said to the Blessed One, “When a monk is an arahant, with his fermentations ended—one who has reached fulfillment, done the task, laid down the burden, attained the true goal, totally destroyed the fetter of becoming, and is released through right gnosis—the thought doesn’t occur to him that ‘There is someone better than me,’ or ‘There is someone equal to me,’ or ‘There is someone worse than me.’” That is what Ven. Khema said, and the Teacher approved. Sensing that “The Teacher approves of me,” Ven. Khema got up from his seat, bowed down to the Blessed One, circled him—keeping him on his right—and left.</p>
<p>Then Ven. Sumana, not long after Ven. Khema had left, said to the Blessed One, “When a monk is an arahant, with his fermentations ended—one who has reached fulfillment, done the task, laid down the burden, attained the true goal, totally destroyed the fetter of becoming, and is released through right gnosis—the thought doesn’t occur to him that ‘There is no one better than me,’ or ‘There is no one equal to me,’ or ‘There is no one worse than me.’” That is what Ven. Sumana said, and the Teacher approved. Sensing that “The Teacher approves of me,” Ven. Sumana got up from his seat, bowed down to the Blessed One, circled him—keeping him on his right—and left.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, not long after Ven. Khema & Ven. Sumana had left, said to the monks, “Monks, this is how clansmen declare gnosis. The meaning [of gnosis] is stated, but without mention of self. Yet there are some worthless people who declare gnosis as if in jest. They will fall into trouble afterward.</p>
<blockquote class="gatha"><p>Not as higher, lower, nor equal <br>do they refer to themselves. <br>With birth ended, <br>the holy life fulfilled <br>they go about <br>totally freed from fetters.”  </p></blockquote>
