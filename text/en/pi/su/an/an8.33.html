<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these eight grounds for giving. What eight? (1) One gives a gift from desire. (2) One gives a gift from hatred. (3) One gives a gift from delusion. (4) One gives a gift from fear. (5) One gives a gift, <span class="supplied">thinking</span>: ‘Giving was practiced before by my father and forefathers; I should not abandon this ancient family custom.’ (6) One gives a gift, <span class="supplied">thinking</span>: ‘Having given this gift, with the breakup of the body, after death, I will be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.’ (7) One gives a gift, <span class="supplied">thinking</span>: ‘When I am giving this gift my mind becomes placid, <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.237"></a> and elation and joy arise.’ (8) One gives a gift for the purpose of ornamenting the mind, equipping the mind. These are the eight grounds for giving.”</p>
