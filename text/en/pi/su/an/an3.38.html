<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, once in the past, when Sakka, ruler of the devas, was guiding the Tāvatiṃsa devas, on that occasion he recited this verse:</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“This verse, bhikkhus, was badly recited by Sakka, ruler of the devas, not well recited. It was badly stated, not well stated. For what reason? Because Sakka, ruler of the devas, is not free from birth, old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; he is not free from suffering, I say.

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“‘The person who would be like me …<br>
and during special fortnights.’ <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.145"></a><br></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“For what reason? Because that bhikkhu is free from birth, old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; he is free from suffering, I say.”</p>
