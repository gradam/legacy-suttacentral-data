<h1>31. A Share in Clear Knowing</h1>
</div>
<p>“These two qualities have a share in clear knowing. Which two? Tranquillity <i>(samatha)</i> & insight <i>(vipassana).</i></p>
<p>“When tranquillity is developed, what purpose does it serve? The mind is developed. And when the mind is developed, what purpose does it serve? Passion is abandoned.</p>
<p>“When insight is developed, what purpose does it serve? Discernment is developed. And when discernment is developed, what purpose does it serve? Ignorance is abandoned.</p>
<p>“Defiled by passion, the mind is not released. Defiled by ignorance, discernment does not develop. Thus from the fading of passion is there awareness-release. From the fading of ignorance is there discernment-release.”</p>
