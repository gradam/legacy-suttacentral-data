<h1>1. Loving-Kindness</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Bhikkhus, when the liberation of the mind by loving-kindness has been pursued, developed, and cultivated, made a vehicle and basis, carried out, consolidated, and properly undertaken, eight benefits are to be expected. What eight?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>(1) “One sleeps well; (2) one awakens happily; (3) one does not have bad dreams; (4) one is pleasing to human beings; (5) one is pleasing to spirits; (6) deities protect one; (7) fire, poison, and weapons do not injure one; and (8) if one does not penetrate further, one moves on to the brahmā world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“When, bhikkhus, the liberation of the mind by loving-kindness has been pursued, developed, and cultivated, made a vehicle and basis, carried out, consolidated, and properly undertaken, these eight benefits are to be expected.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>For one who, ever mindful, develops<br>
measureless loving-kindness,<br>
the fetters thin out as he sees<br>
the destruction of the acquisitions. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.151"></a><br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>If, with a mind free from hate,<br>
one arouses love toward just one being,<br>
one thereby becomes good.<br>
Compassionate in mind toward all beings,<br>
the noble one generates abundant merit.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>Those royal sages who conquered the earth<br>
with its multitudes of beings<br>
traveled around performing sacrifices:<br>
the horse sacrifice, the person sacrifice,<br><span class="italic">sammāpāsa</span>, <span class="italic">vājapeyya</span>, <span class="italic">niraggaḷa</span>.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>All these are not worth a sixteenth part<br>
of a well-developed loving mind,<br>
just as the hosts of stars cannot match<br>
a sixteenth part of the moon’s radiance.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>One who does not kill or enjoin killing,<br>
who does not conquer or enjoin conquest,<br>
one who has loving-kindness toward all beings<br>
harbors no enmity toward anyone.<br></p>
