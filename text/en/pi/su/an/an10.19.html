<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these ten abodes of the noble ones in which the noble ones of the past, present, or future abide. What ten?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Here, a bhikkhu (1) has abandoned five factors; (2) possesses six factors; (3) has a single guard (4) and four supports; (5) has dispelled personal truths, (6) totally renounced seeking, (7) purified his intentions, (8) tranquilized bodily activity, and become (9) well liberated in mind and (10) well liberated by wisdom. These are the ten abodes of the noble ones in which the noble ones of the past, present, or future abide.”</p>
