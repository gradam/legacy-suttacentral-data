<h1>57. Sīha</h1>

<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span></p>
<p>Once, while the Exalted One dwelt near Vesālī, at the Gabled Hall in Mahavana, general Sīha visited him, saluted and sat down at one side.</p>
<p>So seated, he said to the Exalted One:</p>
<p>‘Is it possible, lord, to show the visible result of giving?’</p>
<p>‘Well, Sīha, just on that I will question you in return; explain the matter as it seems good to you.</p>
<p>Now what think you, Sīha?</p>
<p>There might be two men: one unbelieving, mean, miserly, cross-grained; the other a believer, a master-giver, delighting in constant giving.</p>
<p>What think you, Sīha, on whom would compassionate arahants first have compassion; the unbelieving, mean, miserly, cross-grained man or the believer, the master-giver who delights in constant alms-giving?</p>
<p>‘The unbeliever, mean, miserly, cross-grained man, lord, why should they first have compassion on him?</p>
<p>But the believer, the master-giver who delights in constant alms-giving, on him surely they would first have compassion.’</p>
<p><a id="pts-vp" class="pts-vp47"></a>‘Then what think you, Sīha?</p>
<p>Which of the twain would visiting arahants first visit; the unbelieving, mean, miserly, cross-grained man or the believer, the master-giver who delights in constant alms-giving?</p>
<p>‘The unbeliever, mean, miserly, cross-grained man, lord, why should visiting arahants first visit him?</p>
<p>But the believer, the master-giver who delights in constant alms-giving, surely visiting arahants would first visit him.’</p>
<p>‘Then what think you, Sīha?</p>
<p>From whom would receiving arahants first receive alms; the unbelieving, mean, miserly, cross-grained man or the believer, the master-giver who delights in constant alms-giving?</p>
<p>‘The unbeliever, mean, miserly, cross-grained man, lord, why should receiving arahants first receive alms from him?</p>
<p>But the believer, the master-giver who delights in constant alms-giving, surely receiving arahants would first receive alms from him.’</p>
<p>‘Then what think you, Sīha?</p>
<p>To whom would teaching arahants first teach Dhamma; the unbelieving, mean, miserly, cross-grained man or the believer, the master-giver who delights in constant alms-giving?</p>
<p>‘The unbeliever, mean, miserly, cross-grained man, lord, why should teaching arahants first teach Dhamma to him?</p>
<p>But the believer, the master-giver who delights in constant alms-giving, surely teaching arahants would first teach Dhamma to him.’</p>
<p>‘Then what think you, Sīha?</p>
<p>Of whom would a fair report be noised abroad; the unbelieving, mean, miserly, cross-grained man or the believer, the master-giver who delights in constant alms-giving?</p>
<p>‘The unbeliever, mean, miserly, cross-grained man, lord, why would a fair report be noised abroad about him?</p>
<p>But the believer, the master-giver who delights in constant alms-giving, surely a fair report would be noised abroad about him.’</p>
<p>‘Then what think you, Sīha?</p>
<p>Who would approach any gathering—nobles, brahmans, householders, recluses—with confidence, untroubled; the unbelieving, mean, miserly, cross-grained man or the believer, the master-giver who delights in constant alms-giving?</p>
<p>‘The unbeliever, mean, miserly, cross-grained man, lord, how would would he approach any gathering—nobles, brahmans, householders, recluses—with confidence, untroubled?</p>
<p>But the believer, the master-giver who delights in constant alms-giving, surely he would approach any gathering—nobles, brahmans, householders, recluses—with confidence, untroubled.’</p>
<p>‘And what think you, Sīha, who, on the breaking up of the body after death, would arise in the happy heaven world: the unbelieving, mean, miserly, cross-grained man or the believer, the master-giver who delights in constant almsgiving?</p>
<p>‘The unbeliever, mean, miserly, cross-grained man, lord, why shall he, on the breaking up of the body after death, arise in the happy heaven world?</p>
<p>But the believer, the master-giver who delights in constant alms-giving, surely he after death may arise in the happy heaven world.</p>
<p>Lord, these six visible results of giving, declared by the Exalted One—I go not to the Exalted One for faith for that; I just know them.</p>
<p>I, lord, am a giver, a master-giver, and on me compassionate arahants first have compassion.</p>
<p>I, lord, am a giver, a master-giver, and on me they first visit.</p>
<p>I, lord, am a giver, a master-giver, and from me they first receive.</p>
<p>I, lord, am a giver, a master-giver, and to me they first teach Dhamma.</p>
<p>I, lord, am a giver, a master-giver, and of me a fair report is noised abroad:</p>
<p>"General Sīha is a giver, a worker, the Order's servant," it is said.</p>
<p>I, lord, am a giver, a master-giver, and any gathering I approach—nobles, brahmans, householders, recluses—I approach with confidence, untroubled.</p>
<p>Lord, these six visible results of giving, declared by the Exalted One—I go not to the Exalted One for faith for that; I just know them.</p>
<p>But when the Exalted One said:</p>
<p>“The giver, Sīha, the master-giver, on the breaking up of the body after death, arises in the happy heaven world”—that I know not; and there I go to the Exalted One for faith.’</p>
<p>‘Thus it is, Sīha, thus it is; the giver, Sīha, the master-giver, on the breaking up of the body after death, arises in the happy heaven world.’</p>
