<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Ānanda, I claim to be confident about the things that lead to the realization by direct knowledge of the various doctrinal principles, <span class="supplied">and I am thus able</span> to teach the Dhamma to various people in various ways such that one who practices accordingly will know of what exists that it exists and of what does not exist that it does not exist; such that one will know of the inferior that it is inferior and of the sublime that it is sublime; such that one will know of what is surpassable that it is surpassable and of what is unsurpassable that it is unsurpassable; such that <a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.37"></a> it is possible that one will know, see, and realize this just as it is to be known, seen, and realized.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“These, Ānanda, are the ten Tathāgata’s powers that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel.” <a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.39"></a></p>
