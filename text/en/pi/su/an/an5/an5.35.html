<h1>35 The Benefits of Giving</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits of giving. What five? (1) One is dear and agreeable to many people. (2) Good persons resort to one. (3) One acquires a good reputation. (4) One is not deficient in the layperson’s duties. (5) With the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. These are the five benefits in giving.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>By giving, one becomes dear,<br>
one follows the duty of the good;<br>
the good self-controlled monks<br>
always resort to one.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>They teach one the Dhamma<br>
that dispels all suffering,<br>
having understood which<br>
the taintless one here attains nibbāna.<br></p>
