<h1>98. Wilderness</h1>
</div>
<p>“Endowed with five qualities, a monk pursuing mindfulness of breathing will in no long time penetrate the Unprovoked [release]. Which five?</p>
<p>“He is a person who imposes only a little [on others]: one of few duties & projects, easy to support, easily contented with the requisites of life.</p>
<p>“He is a person who eats only a little food, committed to not indulging his stomach.</p>
<p>“He is a person of only a little sloth, committed to wakefulness.</p>
<p>“He lives in the wilderness, in an isolated dwelling place.</p>
<p>“He reflects on the mind as it is released.</p>
<p>“Endowed with these five qualities, a monk pursuing mindfulness of breathing will in no long time penetrate the Unprovoked.”</p>
