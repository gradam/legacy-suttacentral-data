</div>
 
<h1>254.</h1>
<p>“Monks, there are these five forms of stinginess. Which five? Stinginess as to one’s monastery [lodgings], stinginess as to one’s family [of supporters], stinginess as to one’s gains, stinginess as to one’s status, and stinginess as to the Dhamma. These are the five forms of stinginess. And the meanest of these five is this: stinginess as to the Dhamma.”</p>
<h1>255.</h1>
<p>“With the abandoning and eradication of the five forms of stinginess, the holy life is fulfilled. Which five?</p>
<p>“With the abandoning and eradication of stinginess as to one’s monastery [lodgings], the holy life is fulfilled. With the abandoning and eradication of stinginess as to one’s family [of supporters] … stinginess as to one’s gains … stinginess as to one’s status … stinginess as to the Dhamma, the holy life is fulfilled.</p>

<p>“Without abandoning these five qualities, one is incapable of entering & remaining in the first jhana. Which five? Stinginess as to one’s monastery [lodgings], stinginess as to one’s family [of supporters], stinginess as to one’s gains, stinginess as to one’s status, and stinginess as to the Dhamma. Without abandoning these five qualities, one is incapable of entering & remaining in the first jhana.</p>

Stinginess as to one’s monastery [lodgings]… one’s family [of supporters]… one’s gains… one’s status, and stinginess as to the Dhamma. With the abandoning of these five qualities, one is capable of entering & remaining in the first jhana.”</p>

<h1>257-263.</h1>
<p>“Without abandoning these five qualities, one is incapable of entering & remaining in the second jhana… the third jhana … the fourth jhana; incapable of realizing the fruit of stream-entry… the fruit of once-returning… the fruit of non-returning… arahantship. Which five? Stinginess as to one’s monastery [lodgings]… one’s family [of supporters]… one’s gains… one’s status, and stinginess as to the Dhamma. Without abandoning these five qualities, one is incapable of entering & remaining in the second jhana… the third jhana… the fourth jhana; one is incapable realizing the fruit of stream-entry… the fruit of once-returning… the fruit of non-returning… arahantship.</p>
