<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, one who possesses three qualities should be known as a fool. What three? Afflictive bodily action, afflictive verbal action, and afflictive mental action. One who possesses these three qualities should be known as a fool.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“One who possesses three qualities should be known as a wise person. What three? Unafflictive bodily action, unafflictive verbal action, and unafflictive mental action. One who possesses these three qualities should be known as a wise person.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will avoid the three qualities possessing which one is known as a fool, and we will undertake and observe the three qualities possessing which one is known as a wise person.’ It is in this way that you should train yourselves.” <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.105"></a></p>
