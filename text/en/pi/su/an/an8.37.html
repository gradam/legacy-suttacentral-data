<h1>37 The Good Person’S Gifts</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these eight gifts of a good person. What eight? <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.244"></a> (1) He gives what is pure; (2) he gives what is excellent; (3) he gives a timely gift; (4) he gives what is allowable; (5) he gives after investigation; (6) he gives often; (7) while giving he settles his mind in confidence; and (8) having given, he is elated. These are the eight gifts of a good person.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>He gives what is pure and excellent,<br>
allowable drinks and food at the proper time;<br>
he gives gifts often to fertile fields of merit,<br>
to those who lead the spiritual life.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>He does not feel regret,<br>
having given away many material things.<br>
Those with deep insight praise<br>
the gifts given in this way.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Having thus practiced charity<br>
with a mind freely generous,<br>
one intelligent and wise, rich in faith,<br>
is reborn in a pleasant, unafflicted world.<br></p>
