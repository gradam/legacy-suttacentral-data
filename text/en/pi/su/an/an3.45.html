<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these three things prescribed by the wise, prescribed by good people. What three? (1) Giving is prescribed by the wise, prescribed by good people. (2) The going forth is prescribed by the wise, prescribed by good people. (3) Attending upon one’s mother and father is prescribed by the wise, prescribed by good people. These three things are prescribed by the wise, prescribed by good people.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Good people prescribe giving,<br>
harmlessness, self-control, and self-taming,<br>
service to one’s mother and father<br>
and to the peaceful followers of the spiritual life.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>These are the deeds of the good<br>
which the wise person should pursue.<br>
The noble one possessed of vision<br>
goes to an auspicious world.<br></p>
