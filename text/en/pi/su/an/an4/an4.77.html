<h1>77. Unconjecturable</h1>
</div>
<p>“There are these four unconjecturables that are not to be conjectured about, that would bring madness & vexation to anyone who conjectured about them. Which four?</p>
<p>“The Buddha-range of the Buddhas is an unconjecturable that is not to be conjectured about, that would bring madness & vexation to anyone who conjectured about it.</p>
<p>“The jhana-range of a person in jhana...</p>
<p>“The [precise working out of the] results of kamma...</p>
<p>“Conjecture about [the origin, etc., of] the world is an unconjecturable that is not to be conjectured about, that would bring madness & vexation to anyone who conjectured about it.</p>
<p>“These are the four unconjecturables that are not to be conjectured about, that would bring madness & vexation to anyone who conjectured about them.”</p>
