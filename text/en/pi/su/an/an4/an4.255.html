<h1>255. Searches</h1>
</div>
<p>“Monks, these four are ignoble searches. Which four? There is the case where a person, being subject himself to aging, seeks [happiness in] what is subject to aging. Being subject himself to illness, he seeks [happiness in] what is subject to illness. Being subject himself to death, he seeks [happiness in] what is subject to death. Being subject himself to defilement, he seeks [happiness in] what is subject to defilement. These are four ignoble searches.</p>
<p>“Now, these four are noble searches. Which four? There is the case where a person, being subject himself to aging, realizing the drawbacks of what is subject to aging, seeks the unaging, unsurpassed rest from the yoke: Unbinding. Being subject himself to illness, realizing the drawbacks of what is subject to illness, he seeks the unailing, unsurpassed rest from the yoke: Unbinding. Being subject himself to death, realizing the drawbacks of what is subject to death, he seeks the undying, unsurpassed rest from the yoke: Unbinding. Being subject himself to defilement, realizing the drawbacks of what is subject to defilement, he seeks the undefiled, unsurpassed rest from the yoke: Unbinding.</p>
<p>“These are four noble searches.”</p>
