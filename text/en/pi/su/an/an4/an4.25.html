<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, this spiritual life is not lived for the sake of deceiving people and cajoling them; nor for the benefit of gain, honor, and praise; nor for the benefit of winning in debates; nor with the thought: ‘Let the people know me thus.’ But rather, this spiritual life is lived for the sake of restraint, abandoning, dispassion, and cessation.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>The Blessed One taught the spiritual life,<br>
not based on tradition, culminating in nibbāna,<br>
lived for the sake of<br>
restraint and abandoning.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>This is the path of the great beings,<br>
the path followed by the great seers.<br>
Those who practice it<br>
as taught by the Buddha,<br>
acting upon the Teacher’s guidance,<br>
will make an end of suffering.<br></p>
