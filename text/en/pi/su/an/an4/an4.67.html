<h1>67. By a Snake</h1>
</div>
<p>On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s monastery. Now, at that time in Savatthi a certain monk had died after having been bitten by a snake. Then a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there they said to him, “Lord, just now in Savatthi a certain monk died after having been bitten by a snake.”</p>
<p>“Then it’s certain, monks, that that monk didn’t suffuse the four royal snake lineages with a mind of good will. For if he had suffused the four royal snake lineages with a mind of good will, he would not have died after having been bitten by a snake. Which four? The Virupakkha royal snake lineage, the Erapatha royal snake lineage, the Chabyaputta royal snake lineage, the Dark Gotamaka royal snake lineage. It’s certain that that monk didn’t suffuse these four royal snake lineages with a mind of good will. For if he had suffused these four royal snake lineages with a mind of good will, he would not have died after having been bitten by a snake. I allow you, monks, to suffuse these four royal snake lineages with a mind of good will for the sake of self-protection, self-guarding, self-preservation.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha"><p>I have good will for the Virupakkhas, <br>good will for the Erapathas, <br>good will for the Chabyaputtas, <br>good will for the Dark Gotamakas. </p><p>I have good will for footless beings, <br>good will for two-footed beings, <br>good will for four-footed beings, <br>good will for many-footed beings. </p><p>May footless beings do me no harm. <br>May two-footed beings do me no harm.<br>May four-footed beings do me no harm.<br>May many-footed beings do me no harm. </p><p>May all creatures, <br>all breathing things, all beings<br>—each & every one—<br>meet with good fortune. <br>May none of them come to any evil. </p><p>Limitless is the Buddha, <br>limitless the Dhamma, <br>limitless the Sangha.<br>There is a limit to creeping things: <br>snakes, scorpions, centipedes, <br>spiders, lizards, & rats. <br>I have made this safeguard, <br>I have made this protection. <br>May the beings depart.<br>I pay homage to the Blessed One, <br>homage <br>to the seven rightly self-awakened ones.</p></blockquote>
