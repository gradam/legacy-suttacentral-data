<h1>6. One of Little Learning</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? One of little learning who is not intent on what he has learned; one of little learning who is intent on what he has learned; one of much learning who is not intent on what he has learned; and one of much learning who is intent on what he has learned.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>(1) “And how is a person one of little learning who is not intent on what he has learned? <a class="pts_pn" id="an.ii.7"></a> Here, someone has learned little—that is, of the discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and questions-and-answers—but he does not understand the meaning of what he has learned; he does not understand the Dhamma; and he does not practice in accordance with the Dhamma. In such a way, a person is one of little learning who is not intent on what he has learned.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>(2) “And how is a person one of little learning who is intent on what he has learned? Here, someone has learned little—that is, of the discourses … questions-and-answers—but having understood the meaning of what he has learned, and having understood the Dhamma, he practices in accordance with the Dhamma. In such a way, a person is one of little learning who is intent on what he has learned.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>(3) “And how is a person one of much learning who is not intent on what he has learned? Here, someone has learned much—that is, of the discourses … questions-and-answers—but he does not understand the meaning of what he has learned; he does not understand the Dhamma; and he does not practice in accordance with the Dhamma. In such a way, a person is one of much learning who is not intent on what he has learned.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>(4) “And how is a person one of much learning who is intent on what he has learned? Here, someone has learned much—that is, of the discourses … questions-and-answers—and having understood the meaning of what he has learned, and having understood the Dhamma, he practices in accordance with the Dhamma. In such a way, a person is one of much learning who is intent on what he has learned.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>If one has little learning<br>
and is not settled in the virtues,<br>
they criticize him on both counts,<br>
virtuous behavior and learning.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>If one has little learning<br>
but is well settled in the virtues,<br>
they praise him for his virtuous behavior;<br>
his learning has succeeded.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>If one is highly learned<br>
but is not settled in the virtues,<br>
they criticize him for his lack of virtue;<br>
his learning has not succeeded. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.ii.8"></a><br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>If one is highly learned<br>
and is settled in the virtues,<br>
they praise him on both counts,<br>
virtuous behavior and learning.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>When a disciple of the Buddha is highly learned,<br>
an expert on the Dhamma, endowed with wisdom,<br>
like a coin of refined mountain gold,<br>
who is fit to blame him?<br>
Even the devas praise such a one;<br>
by Brahmā too he is praised.<br></p>
