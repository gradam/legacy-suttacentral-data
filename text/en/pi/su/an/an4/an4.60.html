<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Blessed One…. The Blessed One said to him:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Householder, a noble disciple who possesses four qualities is practicing the way proper to the layperson, a way that brings the attainment of fame and leads to heaven. What four?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Here, householder, a noble disciple serves the Saṅgha of bhikkhus with robes; he serves the Saṅgha of bhikkhus with almsfood; he serves the Saṅgha of bhikkhus with lodgings; he serves the Saṅgha of bhikkhus with medicines and provisions for the sick.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Householder, a noble disciple who possesses these four qualities is practicing the way proper to the layperson, a way that brings the attainment of fame and leads to heaven.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>When the wise practice the way<br>
proper for the layperson, they serve<br>
the virtuous monks of upright conduct<br>
with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines:<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>for them both by day and night<br>
merit always increases;<br>
having done excellent deeds,<br>
they pass on to a heavenly state.<br></p>
