<h1>8 Self-Confidence</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of self-confidence that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he claims the place of the chief bull, <a class="pts_pn" id="an.ii.9"></a> roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel. What four?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>(1) “I do not see any ground on the basis of which an ascetic or brahmin or deva or Māra or Brahmā or anyone in the world might reasonably reprove me, saying: ‘Though you claim to be perfectly enlightened, you are not fully enlightened about these things.’ Since I do not see any such ground, I dwell secure, fearless, and self-confident.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>(2) “I do not see any ground on the basis of which an ascetic or brahmin or deva or Māra or Brahmā or anyone in the world might reasonably reprove me, saying: ‘Though you claim to be one whose taints are destroyed, you have not fully destroyed these taints.’ Since I do not see any such ground, I dwell secure, fearless, and self-confident.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>(3) “I do not see any ground on the basis of which an ascetic or brahmin or deva or Māra or Brahmā or anyone in the world might reasonably reprove me, saying: ‘These things that you have said to be obstructive are not able to obstruct one who engages in them.’ Since I do not see any such ground, I dwell secure, fearless, and self-confident.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>(4) “I do not see any ground on the basis of which an ascetic or brahmin or deva or Māra or Brahmā or anyone in the world might reasonably reprove me, saying: ‘The Dhamma does not lead one who practices it to the complete destruction of suffering, the goal for the sake of which you teach it.’ Since I do not see any such ground, I dwell secure, fearless, and self-confident.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of self-confidence that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the wheel of Brahmā.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>These pathways of doctrine,<br>
formulated in diverse ways,<br>
relied upon by ascetics and brahmins,<br>
do not reach the Tathāgata,<br>
the self-confident one who has passed<br>
beyond the pathways of doctrine.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>Consummate, having overcome <span class="supplied">everything</span>,<br>
he set in motion the wheel of Dhamma<br>
out of compassion for all beings.<br>
Beings pay homage to such a one,<br>
the best among devas and humans,<br>
who has gone beyond existence. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.ii.10"></a><br></p>
