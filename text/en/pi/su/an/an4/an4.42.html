<h1>42. Questions</h1>
</div>
<p>“There are these four ways of answering questions. Which four? There are questions that should be answered categorically [straightforwardly yes, no, this, that]. There are questions that should be answered with an analytical (qualified) answer [defining or redefining the terms]. There are questions that should be answered with a counter-question. There are questions that should be put aside. These are the four ways of answering questions.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha"><p>First the categorical answer, <br>then the qualified, <br>third, the type to be counter-questioned, <br>& fourth, the one to be set aside.<br>Any monk who knows which is which, <br>in line with the Dhamma, <br>is said to be skilled <br>in the four types of questions: <br>hard to overcome, hard to beat, <br>profound, hard to defeat. <br>He knows what’s worthwhile <br>& what’s not, <br>proficient in (recognizing) both, <br>he rejects the worthless, <br>grasps the worthwhile.<br>He’s called one who has broken through <br>to what’s worthwhile, <br>prudent, <br>wise.</p></blockquote>
