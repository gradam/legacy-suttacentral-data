<p>“Bhikkhus, possessed of five things a bhikkhu is unable to live engaging in proper composure. What five? Here, a bhikkhu is intolerant of (visual) forms, intolerant of sounds, intolerant of odours, intolerant of tastes, intolerant of physical sensations. Possessed with these five things a bhikkhu is unable to live engaging in proper composure.</p>
