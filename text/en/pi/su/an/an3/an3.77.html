<h1>77. Becoming (2)</h1>
</div>
<p>Then Ven. Ananda went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowed down to him and sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, “Lord, this word, ‘becoming, becoming’—to what extent is there becoming?”</p>
<p>“Ananda, if there were no kamma ripening in the sensuality-property, would sensuality-becoming be discerned?”</p>
<p>“No, lord.”</p>
<p>“Thus kamma is the field, consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture. The <a title=’Pali: cetana’>intention & aspiration</a> of living beings hindered by ignorance & fettered by craving is established in/tuned to a lower property. Thus there is the production of renewed becoming in the future.</p>
<p>“If there were no kamma ripening in the form-property, would form-becoming be discerned?”</p>
<p>“No, lord.”</p>
<p>“Thus kamma is the field, consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture. The intention & aspiration of living beings hindered by ignorance & fettered by craving is established in/tuned to a middling property. Thus there is the production of renewed becoming in the future.</p>
<p>“If there were no kamma ripening in the formless-property, would formless-becoming be discerned?”</p>
<p>“No, lord.”</p>
<p>“Thus kamma is the field, consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture. The intention & aspiration of living beings hindered by ignorance & fettered by craving is established in/tuned to a refined property. Thus there is the production of renewed becoming in the future. This is how there is becoming.”</p>
