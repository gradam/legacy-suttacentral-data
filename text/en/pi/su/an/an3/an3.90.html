<h1>90. Trainings (2)</h1>
</div>
<p>“There are these three trainings. Which three? The training in heightened virtue, the training in heightened mind, the training in heightened discernment.</p>
<p>“And what is the training in heightened virtue? There is the case where a monk is virtuous. He dwells restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha, consummate in his behavior & sphere of activity. He trains himself, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest fault. This is called the training in heightened virtue.</p>
<p>“And what is the training in heightened mind? There is the case where a monk—quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful [mental] qualities—enters & remains in the first jhana: rapture & pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation. With the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, he enters & remains in the second jhana: rapture & pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought & evaluation—internal assurance. With the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters & remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, ‘Equanimous & mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.’ With the abandoning of pleasure & pain—as with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress—he enters & remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This is called the training in heightened mind.</p>
<p>“And what is the training in heightened discernment? There is the case where a monk, through the ending of the mental fermentations, enters & remains in the fermentation-free awareness-release & discernment-release, having known & made them manifest for himself right in the here & now. This is called the training in heightened discernment.</p>
<p>“These are the three trainings.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha"><p>Heightened virtue, <br>heightened mind, heightened discernment: <br>persistent, <br>firm, <br>steadfast, <br>absorbed in jhana, <br>mindful, <br>with guarded faculties <br>you should practice them— </p><p>as in front, so behind; <br>as behind, so in front; <br>as below, so above; <br>as above, so below; <br>as by day, so by night; <br>as by night, so by day; </p><p>conquering all the directions <br>with limitless concentration.</p> <p>This is called the practice of training, <br>as well as the pure way of life. <br>[Following it,] you’re called self-awakened in the world, <br>enlightened, <br>one who’s taken the path to its end.</p> <p>With the cessation of sensory consciousness <br>of one released in the stopping of craving, <br>the liberation of awareness of one released in the stopping of craving, <br>is like the unbinding of a flame.</p></blockquote>
