<h1>122. Sagacity</h1>
</div>
<p>Monks, there are these three forms of sagacity. Which three? Bodily sagacity, verbal sagacity, and mental sagacity.</p>
<p>And what is bodily sagacity? There is the case where a monk abstains from taking life, abstains from theft, abstains from unchastity. This is called bodily sagacity.</p>
<p>And what is verbal sagacity? There is the case where a monk abstains from lying, abstains from divisive tale-bearing, abstains from harsh language, abstains from idle chatter. This is called verbal sagacity.</p>
<p>And what is mental sagacity? There is the case where a monk who—with the wasting away of the mental fermentations—remains in the fermentation-free awareness-release and discernment-release, having known and made them manifest for himself right in the here and now. This is called mental sagacity.</p>
<p>These, monks, are the three forms of sagacity.</p>
<blockquote class="gatha"><p>A sage in body, a sage in speech,<br>A sage in mind, without fermentation: <br>a sage consummate in sagacity <br>is said to have abandoned everything.<br>—the All.</p></blockquote>
