<h1>118. The Near Shore</h1>
</div>
<p>“Monks, I shall point out the nearest shore and the farthest shore.  Hear this, and thoroughly attend to it in mind. I shall speak.”</p>
<p>“Just so, Venerable One,” the monks assented to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>“What, monks, is the nearest shore; what is the farthest shore?</p>
<p>“Wrong view is the nearest shore; right view is the farthest shore;</p>
<p>“Wrong intention is the nearest shore; right intention is the farthest shore;<br /> wrong speech is the nearest shore; right speech is the farthest shore;<br /> wrong conduct is the nearest shore; right conduct is the farthest shore;<br /> wrong livelihood is the nearest shore; right livelihood is the farthest shore;<br /> wrong effort is the nearest shore; right effort is the farthest shore;<br /> wrong mindfulness is the nearest shore; right mindfulness is the farthest shore;<br /> wrong concentration is the nearest shore; right concentration is the farthest shore;<br /> wrong knowledge is the nearest shore; right knowledge is the farthest shore;<br /> wrong liberation is the nearest shore; right liberation is the farthest shore.</p>
<p>“This, monks, is the nearest shore; this is the farthest shore.</p>
<blockquote class="gatha"><p>“Amongst humans, very few are they, <br>those mortals going to the farthest shore; <br>Rather, the rest of humankind<br> runs just along this shore. </p> <p>Those who, indeed, practise in the Dhamma, <br>in the well-taught Dhamma, <br>They are mortals who will go beyond <br>the sway of death, so difficult to escape.</p><p> Renouncing the dark qualities,<br> the wise person should cultivate the bright;  <br>From home, having come to homelessness, <br>in seclusion, where delight is difficult, </p> <p>One should wish to feel delight there, <br>having destroyed sensuality, a person of nothing. <br>The wise person should purify himself <br>from the defilements of the mind. </p> <p>Those with mind rightly well-cultivated <br>in the qualities of perfect awakening, <br>Who, in the giving-up of grasping, <br>without clinging, are delighted, <br>The brilliant ones, with unconscious influences withered away,  <br>they, in the world, are completely unbound.”</p></blockquote>
