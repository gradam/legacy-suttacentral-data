<h1>48. Ten Things</h1>
</div>
<p>“There are these ten things that a person gone-forth should reflect on often. Which ten?</p>
<p>“‘I have become casteless’: a person gone forth should often reflect on this.</p>
<p>“‘My life is dependent on others’...</p>
<p>“‘My behavior should be different [from that of householders]’...</p>
<p>“‘Can I fault myself with regard to my virtue?’...</p>
<p>“‘Can my knowledgeable fellows in the holy life, on close examination, fault me with regard to my virtue?’...</p>
<p>“‘I will grow different, separate from all that is dear & appealing to me’...</p>
<p>“‘I am the owner of my actions <i>(kamma),</i> heir to my actions, born of my actions, related through my actions, and have my actions as my arbitrator. Whatever I do, for good or for evil, to that will I fall heir’...</p>
<p>“‘What am I becoming as the days & nights fly past?’...</p>
<p>“‘Do I delight in an empty dwelling?’...</p>
<p>“‘Have I attained a superior human attainment, a truly noble distinction of knowledge & vision, such that—when my fellows in the holy life question me in the last days of my life—I won’t feel abashed?’: a person gone forth should often reflect on this.</p>
<p>“These are the ten things that a person gone-forth should reflect on often.”</p>
