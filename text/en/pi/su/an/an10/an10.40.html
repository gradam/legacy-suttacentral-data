<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhante, it is said: ‘Concord in the Saṅgha, concord in the Saṅgha.’ How is there concord in the Saṅgha?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Here, Ānanda, (1) bhikkhus explain non-Dhamma as non-Dhamma … <span class="add">as in 10:38</span> … and (10) what has been prescribed by the Tathāgata as having been prescribed by him. On these ten grounds they do not withdraw and go apart. They do not perform legal acts separately or recite the Pātimokkha separately. It is in this way, Ānanda, that there is concord in the Saṅgha.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“But, Bhante, when one reconciles a divided Saṅgha, what does one generate?”</p>
<p>“One generates divine merit, Ānanda.”</p>
<p>“But, Bhante, what is divine merit?”</p>
<p>“One rejoices in heaven for an eon, Ānanda.” <a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.77"></a></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Pleasant is concord in the Saṅgha,<br>
and the mutual help of those who live in concord.<br>
Delighting in concord, established in Dhamma,<br>
one does not fall away from security from bondage.<br>
Having brought concord to the Saṅgha,<br>
one rejoices in heaven for an eon.<br></p>
