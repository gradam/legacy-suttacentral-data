<h1>53. Standstill</h1>

<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, I do not praise even a standstill in wholesome qualities, much less decline. I praise only growth in wholesome qualities, not a standstill or deterioration.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And how is there deterioration—not a standstill or growth—in wholesome qualities? Here, a bhikkhu has a certain degree of faith, virtuous behavior, learning, renunciation, wisdom, and discernment. Those qualities of his do not remain the same or increase. This, I say, is deterioration rather than a standstill or growth in wholesome qualities. Thus there is deterioration—not a standstill or growth—in wholesome qualities.</p>
