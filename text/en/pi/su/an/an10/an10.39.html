<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Bhante, it is said: ‘Schism in the Saṅgha, schism in the Saṅgha.’ How is there schism in the Saṅgha?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Here, Ānanda, (1) bhikkhus explain non-Dhamma as Dhamma … <span class="supplied">as in 10:37</span> … and (10) what has been prescribed by the Tathāgata as not having been prescribed by him. On these ten grounds they withdraw and go apart. They perform legal acts separately and recite the Pātimokkha separately. It is in this way, Ānanda, that there is schism in the Saṅgha.” “But, Bhante, when one causes schism in a harmonious Saṅgha, what does one generate?”</p>
<p>“One generates evil lasting for an eon, Ānanda.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“But, Bhante, what is that evil lasting for an eon?”</p>
<p>“One is tormented in hell for an eon, Ānanda.” <a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.76"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>One who causes schism in the Saṅgha is bound for misery,</p>
<p>bound for hell, to abide there for an eon.</p>
<p>Delighting in factions, established in non-Dhamma,</p>
<p>he falls away from security from bondage.</p>
<p>Having caused schism in a harmonious Saṅgha,</p>
<p>he is tormented in hell for an eon.</p>
