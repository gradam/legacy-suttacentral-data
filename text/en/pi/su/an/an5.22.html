(2) Without fulfilling the factor of proper conduct, it is impossible for him to fulfill the factor of a trainee. (3) Without fulfilling the factor of a trainee, it is impossible for him to fulfill the aggregate of virtuous behavior. (4) Without fulfilling the aggregate of virtuous behavior, it is impossible for him to fulfill the aggregate of concentration.

<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“(1) But, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is reverential and deferential, and his behavior is congenial to his fellow monks, it is possible for him to fulfill the factor of proper conduct. (2) Having fulfilled the factor of proper conduct, it is possible for him to fulfill the factor of a trainee. (3) Having fulfilled the factor of a trainee, it is possible for him to fulfill the aggregate of virtuous behavior. (4) Having fulfilled the aggregate of virtuous behavior, it is possible for him to fulfill the aggregate of concentration. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.16"></a> (5) Having fulfilled the aggregate of concentration, it is possible for him to fulfill the aggregate of wisdom.”</p>
