“I ask you, Gracious One, please tell this to me,” said venerable Dhotaka,
<br>
“I am waiting for a word of yours, Great Seer,<br>
having heard your utterance I could train for my own Nibbāna.”</p>

“Then you must become ardent, Dhotaka said the Gracious One,<br>
“being prudent and mindful right here, <br>
henceforth, after hearing this utterance you should train for your own
Nibbāna.”</p>

“I see in the world with its gods and men,” said venerable Dhotaka,<br>
“a brahmin who moves about having nothing,<br>
therefore I revere you, All-Seeing Visionary,<br>
O Sakyan, please free me from my doubts.”</p>

“I will not be able to free <br>
anyone in the world who is having doubts, Dhotaka,<br>
but knowing <span class="supplied">Nibbāna</span> , the best thing,<br>
in this way you can cross over the flood.”</p>

“Brahmin! Being compassionate teach,” said venerable Dhotaka,<br>
“the state of detachment that I should know,<br>
then I, being undisturbed, just like the sky,<br>
may live peaceful and independent right here.”</p>

“I shall proclaim the peace to you, Dhotaka,” said the Gracious One,<br>
“which is not hearsay here in the world,<br>
which, having understood, and living mindfully, one can cross over clinging
to the world.”</p>

“I greatly rejoice in that supreme peace, Great Seer,<br>
which, having understood, and living mindfully, one can cross over clinging
to the world.”</p>

“Whatever you know, Dhotaka,” said the Gracious One,<br>
“above, below, and across the middle,<br>
having understood this is called a shackle in the world,<br>
you must not have craving for repeated existence.”</p>
