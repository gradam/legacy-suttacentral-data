<h1>The Discourse about Piṇḍola</h1>
</hgroup><p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then at that time venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja was sitting not far from the Gracious One, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, a forest-dweller, an alms gatherer, a rag-rober, one with <span class="supplied">only</span> three-robes, with few longings, satisfied, completely secluded, unattached, with energy aroused, being one who spoke about the ascetic practices, <span class="supplied">who was</span> applying <span class="supplied">himself</span> to the higher mind.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>The Gracious One saw venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja, who was sitting not far away, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, a forest-dweller, an alms gatherer, a rag-rober, one with <span class="supplied">only</span> three-robes, with few longings, satisfied, completely secluded, unattached, with energy aroused, being one who spoke about the ascetic practices, <span class="supplied">who was</span> applying <span class="supplied">himself</span> to the higher mind.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Not finding fault, not hurting, and restraint in regard to the Pātimokkha,<br>
Knowing the <span class="supplied">correct</span> measure in food, and <span class="supplied">living in</span> a remote dwelling place,<br>
Being devoted to the higher mind—<br>
this is the teaching of the Buddhas.”</p>
