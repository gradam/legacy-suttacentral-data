<h1>The Third Discourse about the Awakening <span class="supplied">Tree</span></h1>
</hgroup>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>
<span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was
dwelling near Uruvelā, on the bank of the river Nerañjarā, at the root of
the Awakening tree, in the first <span class="supplied">period</span> after
attaining Awakening. Then at that time the Gracious One was sitting in one
cross-legged posture for seven days experiencing the happiness of freedom.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>
Then with the passing of those seven days, the Gracious One, after arising
from that concentration, for the last watch of the night, applied his mind
thoroughly to conditional origination in forward and reverse order:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>
“This being so, that is; from the arising of this, that arises, this not
being so, that is not; from the ceasing of this, that ceases, that is to
say: because of ignorance there are <span class="supplied">volitional</span>
processes, because of <span class="supplied">volitional</span> processes:
consciousness, because of consciousness: mind and body, because of mind and
body: the six sense spheres, because of the six sense spheres: contact,
because of contact: feeling, because of feeling: craving, because of
craving: attachment, because of attachment: continuation, because of
continuation: birth, because of birth: old age, death, grief, lamentation,
pain, sorrow, and despair <span class="supplied">all</span> arise, and so
there is an origination of this whole mass of suffering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>
“But from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance, there is the
cessation of <span class="supplied">volitional</span> processes, from the
cessation of <span class="supplied">volitional</span> processes, the
cessation of consciousness, from the cessation of consciousness, the
cessation of mind and body, from the cessation of mind and body, the
cessation of the six sense spheres, from the cessation of the six sense
spheres, the cessation of contact, from the cessation of contact, the
cessation of feeling, from the cessation of feeling, the cessation of
craving, from the cessation of craving, the cessation of attachment, from
the cessation of attachment, the cessation of continuation, from the
cessation of continuation, the cessation of birth, from the cessation of
birth, old age, death, grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and despair
<span class="supplied">all</span> cease, and so there is a cessation of this
whole mass of suffering.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>
Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that
occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>
“When <span class="supplied">the nature of</span> things becomes really
manifest <br>
To the ardent meditating brāhmaṇa,<br>
He dwells dispelling Māra’s army,<br>
As the sun <span class="supplied">dwells</span> lighting up the firmament.”</p>
</blockquote>
