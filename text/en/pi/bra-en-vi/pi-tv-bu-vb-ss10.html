<h1>Monksʼ Suspension 10: Schism of the Sangha</h1>
</div>
<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.296">BD.1.296</a><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Ss.10.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.10.1.1">Bu-Ss.10.1.1</a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.171">Vin.3.171</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1673"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Just then Devadatta went to see Kokālika, Kaṭamodakatissaka, Khaṇḍadeviyā-putta, and Samuddadatta, and he said to them: “Come, let us create a schism in the Sangha of the ascetic Gotama, a break in transmission.”</p>
<p>Kokālika said to Devadatta: “The ascetic Gotama has great spiritual power and might. How will we do this?”</p>
<p>“Well, let’s go to the ascetic Gotama and request five things: ʻBhante, in many ways the Master praises fewness of wishes, contentment, erasing of defilements, ascetic practices, being inspiring,<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.297">BD.1.297</a> reduction of things, and being energetic. And there are five things that lead to just that. It would be good, bhante:</p>
<ol>
<li>if the monks were forest dwellers for life, and whoever enters a village would commit an offence;</li>
<li>if they were alms-collectors for life, and whoever accepts an invitation would commit an offence;</li>
<li>if they were rag-robe wearers for life, and whoever accepts a robe from a lay person would commit an offence;</li>
<li>if they dwelt at the foot of a tree for life, and whoever takes shelter would commit an offence;</li>
<li>if they did not eat fish and meat for life, and whoever does would commit an offence.ʼ</li>
</ol>
<p>“The ascetic Gotama will not allow this, and we will then be able to win people over with these five points.”</p>
<p>“It may be possible to create a schism in the Sangha with these five points, for people have confidence in austerity.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.10.1.2">Bu-Ss.10.1.2</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1674"></a>Then Devadatta, together with his group, went to the Master, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and made his request.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.298">BD.1.298</a> The Master replied: “No, Devadatta. Those who wish may be forest dwellers, and those who wish may live near a village. Those who wish <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.172">Vin.3.172</a> may be alms-collectors, and those who wish may accept invitations. Those who wish may be rag-robe wearers, and those who wish may accept robes from lay people. I have allowed dwelling at the foot of a tree for eight months of the year, as well as fish and meat which are pure in three respects: itʼs not seen, heard or suspected (that the animal has been killed specifically to feed a monastic).”</p>
<p>Devadatta thought, “The Master does not allow the five points,” and he was glad and elated. He rose from his seat, paid homage to the Master, circumambulated him with his right side towards him, and departed with his group.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1675"></a>Devadatta then entered Rājagaha and won people over with the five points, saying, “The ascetic Gotama does not<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.299">BD.1.299</a> agree to them, but we practice in accordance with them.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1676"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.10.1.3">Bu-Ss.10.1.3</a>The foolish people with little faith and confidence said: “These Sakyan ascetics are practising asceticism and they live for the sake of erasing defilements. But the acetic Gotama lives in luxury and is intent on abundance.” But the wise people who had faith and confidence complained and criticised Devadatta: “How can Devadatta proceed to create a schism in the Sangha of the Master, a break in transmission?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1677"></a>Monks heard the criticism of those people, and the monks of few desires … complained and criticised him in the same way.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1678"></a> They informed the Master … and he questioned Devadatta: “Is it true, Devadatta, that you are proceeding to create a schism in the Sangha, a break in transmission?”</p>
<p>“Itʼs true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked him: “… Foolish man, how can you proceed to create a schism in the Sangha, a break in transmission? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2 class="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1679"></a>“If a monk pursues schism in the united Sangha or persists in taking up an issue conducive to schism, the monks should say to him: ‘Venerable, do not pursue schism in the united Sangha or persist in taking up an issue conducive to schism. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.300">BD.1.300</a> Stay with the Sangha, for a united Sangha—in concord, in harmony, having a joint recitation—lives in comfort.’ If that monk <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.173">Vin.3.173</a> continues as before, he should be admonished up to three times to make him stop. If he stops, good. If not, he commits an offence entailing suspension.”</p>
