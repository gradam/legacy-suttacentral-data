<h1>Monksʼ Undetermined 2</h1>

<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.336">BD.1.336</a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-An.2.1">Bu-An.2.1</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1829"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍikaʼs Park. Just then Venerable Udāyī was thinking, “The Master has prohibited sitting alone with a woman on a private and secluded seat suitable for doing it,” and so he sat alone in private with the same girl. There he spoke to her on the Dhamma, or they chatted together if the situation allowed.</p>
<p>For a second time Visākhā had been invited to that family. When she arrived there, she saw Venerable Udāyī sitting alone in private with the same girl, and she said to Venerable Udāyī: “Bhante, itʼs not appropriate that you should sit alone with a woman on a private seat. Although you may not be aiming at that activity, people with little confidence are hard to convince.” But Venerable Udāyī did not listen. After she had left, Visākhā informed the monks about what had happened. The monks of few desires … complained and criticised him: “How can Venerable Udāyī sit alone with a woman on a private seat?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1830"></a>After rebuking Venerable Udāyī in many ways, they informed the Master … “Is it true, Udāyī, that you sat alone with a woman on a private seat?”</p>
<p>“Itʼs true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked him: “… Foolish man, how could you sit alone with a woman on a private seat? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2 class="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1831"></a>“Although a seat is not secluded, nor suitable for doing it, it may be suitable for speaking lewdly to a woman. If a monk sits alone with a woman <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.337">BD.1.337</a> in private on such a seat, and a trustworthy female lay disciple sees him and accuses him of an offence entailing suspension or an offence entailing confession, then, if he admits to the sitting, he is be dealt with according to one of these two or according to <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.192">Vin.3.192</a> what that trustworthy female lay disciple has said. This rule too is undetermined.”</p>
