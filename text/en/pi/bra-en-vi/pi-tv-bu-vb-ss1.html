<h1>Monks’ Suspension 1: Emission of semen</h1>

<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>
<h3 class="anunidana1">First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Ss.1.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.1.1.1">Bu-Ss.1.1.1</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa775"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Sāvatthī, in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time Venerable Seyyasaka was discontent with the spiritual life, and he became thin, haggard, pale, with veins protruding from his limbs. Venerable Udāyī saw Venerable Seyyasaka in this condition and said to him: “Seyyasaka, you are not looking well. Could it be that you are discontent with the spiritual life?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Well then, eat as much as you like, sleep as much as you like, and bathe as much as you like, and whenever you become discontent and lustful, emit semen with your hand.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.193">BD.1.193</a>“But is that allowable?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do it too.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa776"></a>Then Venerable Seyyasaka ate, slept, and bathed as much as he liked, and whenever he became discontent and lustful, he emitted semen with his hand. After some time Venerable Seyyasaka became handsome, with fresh features, a bright complexion, and clear skin. Monks who were his friends said to him: “Seyyasaka, you used to be thin, haggard, pale, with veins protruding from your limbs. Now you are handsome, with fresh features,<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.111">Vin.3.111</a> a bright complexion, and clear skin. Have you been taking medicine?”</p>
<p>“No, I haven’t. I just eat, sleep, and bathe as much as I like, and whenever I become discontent and lustful, I emit semen with my hand.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.1.1.2">Bu-Ss.1.1.2</a>“Do you eat the almsfood of the faithful with the same hand you use to emit semen?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The monks of few desires … complained and criticised him:<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.194">BD.1.194</a> “How can Venerable Seyyasaka emit semen with his hand?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa777"></a>They rebuked Venerable Seyyasaka in many ways and then informed the Master. The Master then convened the Sangha and questioned Venerable Seyyasaka: “Is it true, Seyyasaka, that you emit semen with your hand?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master.”</p>
<p>The Master rebuked him: “Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not becoming, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could you emit semen with your hand? Have I not taught the Dhamma in many ways for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion; for freedom from bondage, not for the sake of bondage; for the sake of non-grasping, not for the sake of grasping? When I have taught the Dhamma in this way, how can you intentionally act to continue in lust, bondage, and clinging? Have I not taught the Dhamma in many ways for the fading away of lust, for the clearing away of intoxication, for the removal of thirst, for the uprooting of attachment, for the cutting off of the round of birth and death, for the ending of craving, for dispassion, for cessation, for extinguishment? Haven’t I declared in many ways the abandoning of sense pleasures, the full understanding of the perceptions of sense pleasure, the removal<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.195">BD.1.195</a> of thirst for sense pleasures, the uprooting of sensual thought, the stilling of the fever of sensuality? Foolish man, this will not give rise to confidence in those without it, nor increase the confidence of those who have it, but it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.” Then, after rebuking Venerable<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.112">Vin.3.112</a> Seyyasaka in many ways for being difficult to support … the Master said: “And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3 class="anupannatti1">Preliminary ruling</h3>
<a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa778"></a>
<p class="rule">“Intentional emission of semen is an offence entailing suspension.”</p>
<p class="endsection"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa779"></a>In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3 class="anunidana2">Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Ss.1.2"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.1.2.1">Bu-Ss.1.2.1</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa780"></a>At one time monks ate delicious food, fell asleep without mindfulness and clear comprehension, and emitted semen while dreaming. They became anxious: “The Master has laid down a training rule<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.196">BD.1.196</a> that intentional emission of semen is an offence entailing suspension. We had an emission of semen while dreaming, and that involves intention. Could it be that we have committed an offence entailing suspension?” They informed the Master. He said: “Monks, there is intention involved, but it is negligible. And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2 class="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa781"></a>“Intentional emission of semen, except while dreaming, is an offence entailing suspension.”</p>
