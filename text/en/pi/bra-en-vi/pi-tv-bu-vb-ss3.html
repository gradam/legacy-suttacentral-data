<h1>Monksʼ Suspension 3: Lewd speech</h1>
</div>
<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.214">BD.1.214</a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.3.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.3.1.1">Bu-Ss.3.1.1</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1133"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time Venerable Udāyī was staying in the wilderness, in a beautiful dwelling. Just then a number of women came to the monastery in order to see the dwellings. They approached Venerable Udāyī and said:</p>
<p>“Bhante, we would like to see your dwelling.”</p>
<p>Then Venerable Udāyī, after showing his dwelling to those women, praised and disparaged their private parts, he requested and implored, asked and enquired, described, instructed and abused. Those <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.128">Vin.3.128</a> women among them who were wanton and shameless flirted with Venerable Udāyī, they called out to him, laughed with him and made fun of him. But those women among them who had a sense of shame, after leaving, complained to the monks: “Bhante, this is not suitable and appropriate. We would not want to hear this from our own husbands, let alone from Venerable Udāyī.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.3.1.2">Bu-Ss.3.1.2</a>The monks of few desires … complained and criticised him: <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.215">BD.1.215</a>“How can Venerable Udāyī speak lewdly to women?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1134"></a>They rebuked Venerable Udāyī in many ways and informed the Master. And the Master convened the Sangha and questioned Venerable Udāyī:</p>
<p>“Is it true, Udāyī, that you spoke lewdly to women?”</p>
<p>“Itʼs true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked him: “Itʼs not suitable, foolish man, itʼs not becoming, itʼs not proper, itʼs not worthy of a recluse, itʼs not allowable, it should not to be done. How could you speak lewdly to women? Have I not taught the Dhamma in many ways for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion … for the stilling of the fevers of sense desire? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
