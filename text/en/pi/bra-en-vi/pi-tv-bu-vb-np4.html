<h1>Monksʼ Relinquishment 4: used robes</h1>
</div>
<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.4.1">Bu-NP.4.1</a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.30">BD.2.30</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1941"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍikaʼs Park. At that time Venerable Udāyīʼs former wife had become a nun. She frequently visited Venerable Udāyī, and he frequently visited her. And Venerable Udāyī shared his meals with that nun.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1942"></a>After dressing in the morning, Venerable Udāyī took his bowl and robe, and went to that nun. He then uncovered his genitals in front of her and sat down on a seat. She too uncovered her genital in front of him and sat down on a seat. Venerable Udāyī lustfully stared at her genitals, and he emitted semen. He then said to that nun:</p>
<p>“Sister, get some water, and I will wash the robe.”</p>
<p>“Give it <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.206">Vin.3.206</a> to me, Venerable, I will wash it.”</p>
<p>She then took some of the semen in her mouth and inserted some into her genitals. Because of that she became pregnant. The nuns said: “This nun is not abstaining from sexuality, she is pregnant.”</p>
<p>She said, “Venerables, I do abstain from sexuality,” and she told them what had happened.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.31">BD.2.31</a>The nuns complained and criticised Venerable Udāyī: “How could Venerable Udāyī get a nun to wash a used robe?” They then informed the monks. The monks of few desires … complained and criticised him: “How could Venerable Udāyī get a nun to wash a used robe?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1943"></a>After criticising Venerable Udāyī in many ways, they informed the Master. … “Is it true, Udāyī, that you got a nun to wash a used robe?”</p>
<p>“Itʼs true, Master.”</p>
<p>“Is she a relative of yours?”</p>
<p>“No, Master.”</p>
<p>“Foolish man, a man and a woman who are not related do not know what is appropriate and what is inappropriate in dealing with each other, what is inspiring behaviour and what is not. And still you got an unrelated nun to wash a used robe. This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2 class="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1944"></a>“If a monk gets an unrelated nun to wash, dye, or beat a used robe, he commits and offence entailing relinquishment and confession.”</p>
<h2 class="pada">Definitions</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.4.2"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-NP.4.2.1">Bu-NP.4.2.1</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1945"></a><span class="term">A</span>: <span class="gloss">whoever …</span> <span class="term">Monk</span>: <span class="gloss">… The monk who is ordained by a complete Sangha through a procedure of one motion and three announcements, which is unchallengeable and fit to stand; this sort of monk is meant in this case.</span></p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1946"></a><span class="term">Unrelated</span>: <span class="gloss">anyone who is not a descendent of oneʼs male ancestors going back seven generations, either on the motherʼs side or on the fatherʼs side.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.32">BD.2.32</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1947"></a><span class="term">Nun</span>: <span class="gloss">fully ordained by both Sanghas.</span></p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1948"></a><span class="term">A used robe</span>: <span class="gloss">even a lower robe worn once or an upper robe worn once.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1949"></a>If he tells her to wash it, he commits an offence of bad conduct. When it has been washed, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment. If he tells her to dye it, he commits an offence of bad conduct. When it has been died, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment. If he tells her to beat it, he commits an offence of bad conduct. When she has struck it once with her hand or with an implement, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment. The robe is to be relinquished to a Sangha, a group, or an individual.</p>
<p>“And, monks, it is to be relinquished in this way. … <span class="add">To be expanded as in Relinquishment 1, MS paragraphs <span class="ref">1873–1877</span>, with appropriate substitutions.</span> … ʻBhante, this used robe of mine, which I got an unrelated nun to wash, is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.ʼ … the Sangha should give … the Venerables should give … ʻI give this robe back to the Venerable.ʼ”</p>
