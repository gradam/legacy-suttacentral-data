<h1>Monksʼ Suspension 6: Building huts</h1>
</div>
<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.246">BD.1.246</a><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Ss.6.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.6.1.1">Bu-Ss.6.1.1</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1417"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. At that time the monks of Āḷavī were building huts by means of begging. The huts were intended for themselves, did not have a sponsoring owner, and were inappropriate in size. Moreover, they were never finished, and so the monks kept on asking and begging: “Give a man, give a servant, give an ox, give a cart, give an adze, give a hatchet, give an axe, give a spade, give a chisel, give a creeper, give bamboo, give <i>muñja</i>-grass, give <i>babbaja</i>-grass, give <i>tiṇa</i>-grass, give clay.” People felt oppressed by all the asking and begging, so much so that when they saw a monk they became alarmed and fearful, and they ran away, took a different path, turned away, and closed their doors. Even when they saw cows they ran away, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.145">Vin.3.145</a>thinking they were monks.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.247">BD.1.247</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1418"></a>At that time Venerable Mahākassapa, after spending the rainy season at Rājagaha, set out for Āḷavī. Walking by stages, he eventually arrived in Āḷavī, where he stayed at the Aggāḷava shrine. Then, after dressing in the morning, Venerable Mahākassapa took his bowl and robe, and entered Āḷavī for alms. When people saw him they became fearful and alarmed, and they ran away, took a different path, turned away, and closed their doors. After finishing his almsround and eating his meal, Venerable Mahākassapa returned and addressed the monks:</p>
<p>“Formerly Āḷavī had plenty of food and almsfood was easy to obtain; it was not difficult to get by on alms. But now Āḷavī is short of almsfood, and itʼs not easy to get by on alms. Why is that?” <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.248">BD.1.248</a>And those monks told Venerable Mahākassapa what had happened.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.6.1.2">Bu-Ss.6.1.2</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1419"></a>At that time, after staying at Rājagaha as long as he liked, the Master too set out for Āḷavī. Walking on tour by stages, he eventually arrived at Āḷavī, and he too stayed at the Aggāḷava shrine.</p>
<p>Then Venerable Mahākassapa approached the Master, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. And he informed the Master of what had happened. <a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1420"></a> The Master then convened the Sangha and questioned the monks of Āḷavī: “Is it true, monks, that you are building huts through begging, huts intended for yourself, without a sponsoring owner, and inappropriate in size? And that because they were never completed, you kept on asking and begging for all sorts of things, and people felt oppressed to point where they now avoid monks?”</p>
<p>“Itʼs true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked them: “… Foolish men, how could you act in this way? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it …” After rebuking them, he spoke on the Dhamma and then addressed the monks:</p>
<h5 class="help-heading">Jataka</h5>
<div class="jataka">
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.6.1.3">Bu-Ss.6.1.3</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1421"></a>“Once upon a time, monks, two sages who were brothers lived near the river Ganges. On one occasion the dragon king Maṇikaṇṭha <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.146">Vin.3.146</a> emerged from the<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.249">BD.1.249</a> Ganges and approached the younger of the two sages, and he encircled him with seven coils and spread his large hood over his head. Then, monks, because of his fear of that dragon, the younger sage became thin, haggard and pale, his veins protruding all over his limbs. The older sage saw him in this state and asked him what was the matter. And the younger sage told him. The elder sage said: ʻWould you like that dragon not to return?ʼ</p>
<p>“ʻI would.ʼ</p>
<p>“ʻWell then, did you see anything belonging to that dragon?ʼ</p>
<p>“ʻI saw a ornamental jewel on his neck.ʼ</p>
<p>“ʻIn that case ask the dragon for that jewel.ʼ</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1422"></a>“Soon the dragon king Maṇikaṇṭha again emerged from the Ganges, approached the younger sage, and stood to one side. The sage said to him, ʻSir, give me the jewel; I want the jewel.ʼ And the dragon thought, ʻThe monk is asking for the jewel,ʼ and he quickly departed.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1423"></a>“Once more the dragon king Maṇikaṇṭha emerged from the Ganges and approached the younger sage. The sage saw him coming <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.250">BD.1.250</a>and said to him: ʻSir, give me the jewel; I want the jewel.ʼ When the dragon heard him, he turned around right there.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1424"></a>“Yet again the dragon king Maṇikaṇṭha emerged from the Ganges. The younger sage saw him emerging and said to him: ʻSir, give me the jewel; I want the jewel.ʼ Then the dragon king spoke these verses to the sage:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.147">Vin.3.147</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1425"></a>“‘My food and drink is abundant and sublime,<br>
And it appears because of this jewel.<br>
I will not give it to you; you ask too much.<br>
Nor will I return to your hermitage.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1426"></a>“‘Like a boy holding a sharp sword,<br>
You frighten me, asking for this stone.<br>
I will not give it to you; you ask too much.<br>
Nor will I return to your hermitage.ʼ</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1427"></a>“And the dragon king Maṇikaṇṭha thought: ‘The monk is asking for the jewel; he wants the jewel,ʼ and he departed and never returned.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.251">BD.1.251</a></p>
<p>Because he did not get to see that beautiful dragon, the young sage became even thinner, more haggard and pale, his veins protruding even more. The older sage saw him in this condition and asked what was the matter. He replied, ʻIt is because I no longer get to see that beautiful dragon.ʼ The older sage then spoke to him in verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1428"></a>“‘One should not beg from those one wishes to be dear to;<br>
One is detested for asking too much.<br>
The dragon, asked for a jewel by the brahmin,<br>
Departed, and was never seen again.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1429"></a>“One will be disliked even by animals, monks, for asking and begging, let alone by human beings.”</p>

<div class="story">
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.6.1.4">Bu-Ss.6.1.4</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1430"></a>“Once upon a time, monks, a certain monk lived in a certain forest thicket on the slopes of the Himalayas. Not far from that thicket was an large, low-lying marsh. A great flock of birds, feeding in this marsh during the day, entered the thicket to roost at night. The monk there was disturbed by the noise of the flocking birds, and so he came to see me. He paid homage to me, sat down to one side, and I said to him: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.148">Vin.3.148</a>ʻI hope you are keeping well, monk, I hope you are comfortable. I hope you are not tired from travelling. And where have you come from?’</p>
<p>“‘I am keeping well, Master, I am comfortable, and I am <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.252">BD.1.252</a>not tired from travelling. On the slopes of the Himalayas there is a great forest thicket and close by a large low-lying marsh. Then, bhante, a large flock of birds, feeding in that low-lying marsh during the day, came at night to roost in that forest thicket. Thatʼs where Iʼve come from, Master, and I left because I was disturbed by the noise of that flock of birds.ʼ</p>
<p>“ʻWould you like that flock of birds not to return?ʼ</p>
<p>“‘I would, Master.’</p>
<p>“ʻWell then, go back to that forest thicket and in the first watch of the night call out three times: “Listen to me, good birds. From whoever roosts in this forest thicket, I want a feather. Each one of you must give me a feather.” And in the second and third watch of the night do the same thing.’</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1431"></a>“The monk then returned to that forest thicket and did as instructed. That flock of birds thought, ʻThe monk is asking for a feather; he wants a feather,ʼ and they left that thicket and never returned. One will be disliked even by animals, monks, for asking and begging, let alone by human beings.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.6.1.5">Bu-Ss.6.1.5</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1432"></a>“Formerly the father of Raṭṭhapāla addressed his son with these verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1433"></a>“‘Raṭṭhāpāla, all these people<br>
Who come to me and beg—<br>
I do not even know them;<br>
So why donʼt you beg from me?’</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1434"></a>‘The beggar isnʼt liked,<br>
Nor is he who doesnʼt give when asked.<br>
That is why I do not beg from you;<br>
Please donʼt hate me for this.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.253">BD.1.253</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1435"></a>“If Raṭṭhapāla, who came from a good family, could speak in this way to his own father, how much more then can people to each other.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Ss.6.1.6">Bu-Ss.6.1.6</a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1436"></a>“Monks, it is hard for householders to acquire and protect their possessions. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.3.149">Vin.3.149</a>This being so, foolish men, you still kept on asking and begging for all sorts of things. This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2 class="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>
<p><span class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1437"></a>“When a monk, by means of begging, builds a hut without a sponsoring owner and intended for himself, it is to be no more than 3 metres long and 1.75 meters wide inside. He must get monks to approve a site where no harm will be done and which has a space on all sides. If a monk, by means of begging, builds a hut on a site where harm will be done and which lacks a space on all sides, or he does not get monks to approve the site, or he exceeds the size limit, he commits an offence entailing suspension.”</span></p>
