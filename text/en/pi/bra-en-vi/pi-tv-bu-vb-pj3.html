<h1>Monks’ Expulsion 3: Killing a Human Being</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<h3>First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.3">Bu-Pj.3</a> <a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.3.1">Bu-Pj.3.1</a> <a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.3.1.1" href="#Bu-Pj.3.1.1">Bu-Pj.3.1.1</a> <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.116" href="#bd.1.116">BD.1.116</a> <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.68" href="#Vin.3.68">Vin 3.68</a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.376" href="#ms.376">MS.376</a> At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. At that time the Master spoke to the monks in many ways about unattractiveness—he spoke in praise of unattractiveness, in praise of developing (the perception of) unattractiveness, and in praise of the attainment of unattractiveness.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.377" href="#ms.377">MS.377</a> And the Master addressed the monks: “Monks, I wish to go into solitary retreat for half a month. No one is to approach me except the one who brings me almsfood.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master,” they replied, and no one approached him except the one who brought him almsfood.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.378" href="#ms.378">MS.378</a> The monks thought, “The Master has talked in many ways about unattractiveness,” and they devoted themselves to the development (of the perception) of unattractiveness in its many different aspects. As a consequence they became troubled by their own bodies, ashamed of them, loathing them. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.117" href="#bd.1.117">BD.1.117</a> Just as a young woman or man—someone fond of adornments, who had just washed her hair—would be ashamed, humiliated, and disgusted if the carcase of a snake, a dog, or a man were hung around her neck, just so those monks were troubled by their own bodies. They took their own lives, took the lives of one another, and they approached Migalaṇḍika, the ascetic lookalike, and said, “Please kill us. This bowl and robe will be yours.” And, hired for a bowl and robe, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.118" href="#bd.1.118">BD.1.118</a> Migalaṇḍika killed many monks.</p>
<p>He took his <span class="pts">blood-stained</span> knife to the river Vaggumudā, <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.379" href="#ms.379">MS.379</a> and while he was washing it he became anxious and remorseful: “This is truly bad for me; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.69" href="#Vin.3.69">Vin 3.69</a> I have made much demerit by killing virtuous monks.”</p>
<p>Then, walking across the water, a certain god from the realm of the lord of death said to Migalaṇḍika: “Well done, superior man; you are truly fortunate. You have made much merit, because you have brought across those who had not yet crossed.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.119" href="#bd.1.119">BD.1.119</a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.380" href="#ms.380">MS.380</a> And Migalaṇḍika thought, “So it seems I am fortunate and I have made much merit,” and he went from dwelling to dwelling, from dormitory to dormitory, and said, “Who hasnʼt crossed yet? Whom do I bring across?” Those monks who were not free from desire became fearful and terrified, with their hair standing on end, but not so those who were free from desire. <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.381" href="#ms.381">MS.381</a> Then Migalaṇḍika killed a monk, on a single day he killed two monks, on a single day … three … four … five … ten … twenty … thirty … forty … fifty … on a single day he killed sixty monks.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.3.1.2" href="#Bu-Pj.3.1.2">Bu-Pj.3.1.2</a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.382" href="#ms.382">MS.382</a> At the end of that half-month, the Master came out of seclusion and addressed Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, why is the Sangha of monks so diminished?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.120" href="#bd.1.120">BD.1.120</a> Venerable Ānanda told him what had happened, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.70" href="#Vin.3.70">Vin 3.70</a> and he finished by saying: “Master, please give another instruction to the Sangha for the monks to become established in final knowledge.”</p>
<p>“Well then, Ānanda, bring together in the assembly-hall all the monks who live near Vesālī.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.121" href="#bd.1.121">BD.1.121</a> “Yes, Master.”</p>
<p>When he had done so, he approached the Master and said, “Master, the Sangha of monks is assembled. Please do as you think is appropriate.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.383" href="#ms.383">MS.383</a> The Master went to the assembly-hall, sat down on the prepared seat, and said:</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.3.1.3" href="#Bu-Pj.3.1.3">Bu-Pj.3.1.3</a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.384" href="#ms.384">MS.384</a> “Monks, when <i lang="pi">samādhi</i> by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated, it is peaceful and sublime, a satisfying state of happiness, and it stops and settles bad, unwholesome qualities on the spot, whenever they arise. Just as a big, unseasonal storm in the last month of the hot season stops and settles the dust and dirt in the air, just so, when <i lang="pi">samādhi</i> by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated, it is peaceful and sublime, a satisfying state of happiness, and it stops and settles bad, unwholesome qualities on the spot, whenever they arise. <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.385" href="#ms.385">MS.385</a> And how is <i lang="pi">samādhi</i> by mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated in this way?</p>
<div class="sutta">
<p>“A monk sits down in the wilderness, at <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.122" href="#bd.1.122">BD.1.122</a> the foot of a tree, or in an empty hut. He crosses his legs, straightens his body, and establishes mindfulness in front of him. Simply mindful, he breathes in; simply mindful, he breathes out.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.386" href="#ms.386">MS.386</a> “When he breathes in long, he knows it; and when he breathes out long, he knows that. When he breathes in short, he knows it; and when he breathes out short, he knows that. While breathing in, he trains in having the full experience (of the breath); <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.71" href="#Vin.3.71">Vin 3.71</a> while breathing out, he trains in having the full experience (of the breath). While breathing in, he trains in calming the activity of the body; while breathing out, he trains in calming the activity of the body.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.387" href="#ms.387">MS.387</a> “While breathing in, he trains in experiencing joy; while breathing out, he trains in experiencing joy. While breathing in, he trains in experiencing happiness; while breathing out, he trains in experiencing happiness. While breathing in, he trains in experiencing the activity of the mind; while breathing out, he trains in experiencing the activity of the mind. While breathing in, he trains in calming the activity of the mind; while breathing out, he trains in calming the activity of the mind.</p>
<p>“While breathing in, he trains in experiencing the mind; while breathing out, he trains in experiencing the mind. While breathing in, he trains in gladdening the mind; while breathing out, he trains in gladdening the mind. While breathing in, he trains in unifying the mind; while breathing out, he trains in unifying the mind. While breathing in, he trains in freeing the mind; while breathing out, he trains in freeing the mind.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.388" href="#ms.388">MS.388</a> “While breathing in, he trains in contemplating impermanence; while breathing out, he trains in contemplating impermanence. While breathing in, he trains in contemplating fading away; while breathing out, he trains in contemplating fading away. While breathing in, he trains in contemplating cessation; while breathing out, he trains in contemplating cessation. While breathing in, he trains in contemplating relinquishment; while breathing out, he trains in contemplating relinquishment.</p>
</div>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.389" href="#ms.389">MS.389</a> “Monks, when <i lang="pi">samādhi</i> by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated in this way, it is peaceful and sublime, a satisfying state of happiness, and it stops and settles bad, unwholesome qualities on the spot, whenever they arise.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.3.1.4" href="#Bu-Pj.3.1.4">Bu-Pj.3.1.4</a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.390" href="#ms.390">MS.390</a> Then the Master <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.123" href="#bd.1.123">BD.1.123</a> convened the Sangha and questioned the monks:</p>
<p>“Is it true, monks, that some monks have taken their own lives, have killed one another, and have said to Migalaṇḍika, ‘Please kill us. This bowl and robe will be yours’?”</p>
<p>“Itʼs true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked them: “Monks, itʼs not suitable for these monks, itʼs not becoming, itʼs not proper, itʼs not worthy of an ascetic, it is not allowable, it should not be done. How could those monks take their own lives, kill one another, and say to Migalaṇḍika, ‘Please kill us. This bowl and robe will be yours’? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3>Preliminary ruling</h3>
<p class="subrule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.391" href="#ms.391">MS.391</a> “If a monk intentionally kills a human being or searches for someone to kill him, he too is expelled and not in communion.”</p>
<p class="end"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.392" href="#ms.392">MS.392</a> In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3>Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.3.2" href="#Bu-Pj.3.2">Bu-Pj.3.2</a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.393" href="#ms.393">MS.393</a> At one time a certain lay-follower was ill. He had a beautiful and pleasant wife. Some monks belonging to the group of six had fallen in love with her, and they said to each other: “If this <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.72" href="#Vin.3.72">Vin 3.72</a> lay-follower lives, we won’t get this woman. Come, let us praise the beauty of death to him.”</p>
<p>So they went to that lay follower and said: “You have done what is good and wholesome; you have made a <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.124" href="#bd.1.124">BD.1.124</a> shelter against fear. You haven’t done anything bad; you haven’t been greedy or immoral. What’s the point of this wretched and difficult life? Death is better for you than life. When you have passed away, you will be reborn in a happy place, in heaven. There you will be able to enjoy the five types of heavenly sense pleasure.”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.394" href="#ms.394">MS.394</a> That lay-follower thought, “The Venerables have spoken the truth, for I have done what is good and avoided what is bad, and after death I will be reborn in a happy place.”</p>
<p>From then on he ate various types of detrimental food and drank detrimental drinks, and because of this he became seriously ill and died.</p>
<p>But his wife complained and criticised those monks: “These <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.125" href="#bd.1.125">BD.1.125</a> ascetics, the sons of the Sakyan, are shameless, immoral, and liars. They claim to be followers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, of just conduct, committed to the spiritual life, speakers of truth, virtuous, of good conduct. But they don’t have the qualities of an ascetic or a brahmin; they have lost their way. They praised the beauty of death to my husband, and because of them my husband has died.”</p>
<p>And other people complained and criticised them in the same way.</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.395" href="#ms.395">MS.395</a> The monks heard the criticism of those people. Those monks who had few desires and a sense of shame, who were contented, scrupulous, and desirous of training, complained and criticised those monks: “How can they praise the beauty of death to that lay-follower?”</p>
<p><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.396" href="#ms.396">MS.396</a> After rebuking those monks in various ways, they <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.73" href="#Vin.3.73">Vin 3.73</a> informed the Master …</p>
<p>“Is it true, monks, that you praised the beauty of death to that lay-follower?”</p>
<p>“Itʼs true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked them: “Foolish men, itʼs not suitable, it is not becoming, itʼs not proper, itʼs not worthy of an ascetic, itʼs not allowable, it should not be done. How could you praise the beauty of death to that lay-follower? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.397" href="#ms.397">MS.397</a> “If a monk intentionally kills a human being or searches for someone to kill him or praises death or <a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.126" href="#bd.1.126">BD.1.126</a> incites someone to die, saying, ‘Good man, what is the point of this wretched and difficult life? Death is better for you than life!’—thinking and intending thus, if he praises death in various ways or incites someone to die—he too is expelled and not in communion.”</p>
