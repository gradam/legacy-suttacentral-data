<h1>Dharmaguptaka Monks’ Code of Discipline</h1>
</div>
<h2><span class="add"><a id="intro-verse">Introductory verses</a></span></h2>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>
<a class="sc" id="1"></a>
I bend my head in adoration, and worship all the Buddhas,<br>
The Holy Law, and the Church.<br>
Now I proclaim the Law of the Vinaya,<br>
In order to establish for aye the True Law.</p>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="2"></a>
These Precepts are like the fathomless ocean.<br>
Like gems are they, which one tires not in seeking.<br>
Desiring to preserve the treasure of the Holy Law,<br>
In the hearing of the assembly I repeat it.</p>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="3"></a>
Wishful to prevent the prevalence of false views,<br>
I now proclaim these Precepts before the Assembly,<br>
Delivered to us from the earliest times.<br>
Let the Monks then attend!</p>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="4"></a>
Just as if a man destroyed his feet,<br>
So that he could no longer walk,<br>
So it is to destroy these Precepts,<br>
Without which there can be no birth in Heaven.</p>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="5"></a>
Let all those who desire such birth,<br>
Who now are living in the world,<br>
Guard and preserve these Precepts, as feet,<br>
Beware of injuring or mutilating them,</p>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="6"></a>
For as a chariot which has entered<br>
on a narrow and dangerous road,<br>
And suddenly breaks its axle, or loses a linch-pin,<br>
So is the case of the man who breaks the Precepts.</p>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="7"></a>
At the time of death what forebodings!<br>
For as a man looking in a mirror,<br>
Sees himself graceful or deformed, and so has pleasure or pain,<br>
Such is the effect of the Law being declared.</p>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="8"></a>
Has it been observed? What joy!<br>
Has it been neglected? What dismay!<br>
So also as when two hostile armies contend,<br>
The brave advance, the cowards retreat,</p>
Thus is it with respect to this Law,<br>
The pure advance boldly, the transgressors go back.
<p>
<a class="sc" id="9"></a>
As a king is supreme amongst men,<br>
As the ocean is chief of all flowing waters,<br>
As the moon is chief among the stars,<br>
As Buddha is pre-eminent among Sages,</p>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="10"></a>
So among all the codes of Rules,<br>
(This) Book of Precepts is the best.<br>
Tathāgata has established that these Laws,<br>
Should be declared publicly every half month.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a id="prelim">Preliminary</a></h3>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="11"></a>
Are the Monks assembled? (They are.) Are all things arranged? (seats, water,
sweeping, etc.) (They are.) Let all depart who are not ordained. (If any, let
them go; if none are present, let them say so.) Does any monk here present ask
for absolution? (Let them answer accordingly.) Exhortation must be given to the
nuns, (but if there are none present let them say so.) Are we agreed what our
present business is? It is to repeat the Precepts in this lawful assembly.</p>
<h2><span class="add"><a id="nidana">nidāna</a></span></h2>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="12"></a>
Venerable brethren (Bhante) attend now! On this 15th or 14th day of the white
division of the month (or the dark division, as the case may be), let the
assembled monks listen attentively and patiently, whilst the Precepts are
distinctly recited.</p>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="13"></a>
Brethren! I desire to go through the Pātimokkha. Monks assembled thus, let all
consider and devoutly reflect on these Precepts. If any have transgressed let
them repent. If none have transgressed then stand silent. By their silence,
brethren, it shall be known that you are guiltless.</p>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="14"></a>
Now if a stranger ask one of us a question, we are bound to reply truthfully;
so, also, monks, we who reside in community, if we know that we have done wrong
and yet decline to acknowledge it, we are guilty of prevarication. But Buddha
has declared that prevarication effectually prevents our religious advancement.
That brother, therefore, who is conscious of transgression, and desires
absolution, ought at once to declare his fault, and after proper penance he
shall have rest and peace.</p>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="15"></a>
Brethren! having repeated this preface, I ask of you all: Is this assembly pure
or not? (Repeat this three times.) Brethren, this assembly is pure, therefore
it is silent. Silent you stand. So let it be!</p>
<h2><span class="add"><a id="pj">4 pārājika rules</a></span></h2>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="16"></a>
Brethren, I now proceed to recite the four parajika laws, ordered to be recited
twice every month.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="pj1">Pārājika 1</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="17"></a>
If a monk holding the precepts and agreeing there with, without leaving the
community, act in opposition to the precepts, and repent not, wickedly
practising all sorts of impure conduct, till he come to live in common with the
brute beasts, this monk shall be excluded and cut off from the assembly.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="pj2">Pārājika 2</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="18"></a>
If a monk living in a village, or an uninhabited place (quiet place),
encouraging a thievish disposition, take goods which are not given him, with a
thievish intent; and if a king or his minister take this man and imprison,
banish, or kill him (saying), “You are a thief, or you are a fool, or you are
besotted!” This monk shall be excluded, and separated from the community.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="pj3">Pārājika 3</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="19"></a>
If a monk cause a man’s death, or hold a weapon and give it a man (for the
purpose), or if he speak of the advantages of death, or if he ceaselessly
exhort one to meet death (saying), “Tush! you are a brave man,” or use such
wicked speech as this, “It is far better to die and not to live,” using such
considerations as these, bringing every sort of expedient into use, praising
death, exhorting to death. This monk ought to be excluded and cut off.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="pj4">Pārājika 4</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="20"></a>
If a monk, having no true knowledge, speak of himself in these words, “I have
attained perfection (lit. the law above men), I have entered on the most
excellent law of holy or sacred wisdom, I know Truth; I see Truth; and if that
man at another time, whether asked or unasked, desiring absolution, shall speak
thus: “Indeed I neither know nor see, and when I said I saw, and when I said I
knew, it was but vain, wild and false language, in order to exclude the
necessity of further advance, and to encourage my idle disposition.” This monk
ought to be excluded and cut off.</p>
<hr>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="21"></a>
Worthy Sirs! I have thus delivered the four Pārājika rules. If there be any
monk who has transgressed either one or other of them, it is impossible for
such a man to live in the community after his sin as he was before. That man
has acquired the guilt which demands exclusion, and ought not to live as a
member of the monkhood. I demand, therefore, Brethren! Are ye all in this
assembly pure [3 times]. Brethren! This assembly is pure! Silently, therefore,
ye stand! So let it be!</p>
<h2><span class="add"><a id="ss">13 saṅghādisesa rules</a></span></h2>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="22"></a>
Brethren! I now proceed to recite the 13 Saṅghādisesa Rules.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss1">Saṅghādisesa 1</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="23"></a>
If a monk by pampering lustful thoughts be conquered by them, except in his
dreams, let him be suspended.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss2">Saṅghādisesa 2</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="24"></a>
If a monk, encouraging lustful desires, bring his body into contact with that
of a woman, whatever part of her body it be, let him be suspended.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss3">Saṅghādisesa 3</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="25"></a>
If a monk, encouraging lustful thoughts, talk lewdly with a woman, let him be
suspended.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss4">Saṅghādisesa 4</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="26"></a>
If a monk, encouraging lustful thoughts, pampering his body, say, in the
presence of a woman, “Honourable sister, I am preparing myself by the purest
Rule, holding the precepts in their fullest perfection, preparing my self in
the law of perfect virtue, which admits of holding these laws of lustful
desires, (come) minister to me!” and being thus ministered to by the woman, let
him be suspended and undergo the highest penance.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss5">Saṅghādisesa 5</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="27"></a>
If a monk, in his journeyings, busy himself as a matchmaker between this one
and another, and being the messenger of a man, talk with the woman on these
points, or being the messenger of a woman, talk with the man on this subject;
and if he thus complete arrangements so that there be intercourse between the
two, whether for marriage or the occasion only, let him be suspended.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss6">Saṅghādisesa 6</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="28"></a>
If a monk seek to get a house for himself, without a householder, on his own
account alone, he must take care to observe the proper measurements; the mean
measure ments are these, twelve of Buddha’s spans in length, and within, seven
of these spans broad. He ought also to take the body of the monks, to mark out
the position of the place given, in doing which they must observe the character
of the place, that it be not either dangerous of approach or difficult of
access; if the monk, notwithstanding the illegal position, still build his
house, or if he take not the monks to inspect it, or if it exceed the lawful
measurement, let him be suspended.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss7">Saṅghādisesa 7</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="29"></a>
If a monk desire to construct a large house with a proprietor, but for himself,
he ought to take certain of the monks to inspect the character of the site, to
see that it is a place without any difficulty of approach, and not in a
dangerous neighbourhood; if he does not observe these regulations, let him be
suspended.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss8">Saṅghādisesa 8</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="30"></a>
If a monk, from the blind effects of angry resentment, vilify a monk (as worthy
of being) Pārājika, whereas his assertion is mere slander, wishing to remove
that man from his purity, and at another time, solicited or not, he confess
that his charge resulted from anger, let him be suspended.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss9">Saṅghādisesa 9</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="31"></a>
If a monk, because he is angry, take an idea from a different subject, and
slander a monk as fit to be Pārājika, without cause, and if at another time,
solicited or not, he confess that he did so through anger, let him be
suspended.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss10">Saṅghādisesa 10</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="32"></a>
If a monk, wishing to break the harmony among the community, plot and consider
how to accomplish this, firmly holding to his intention and not relinquishing
it, another monk (acquainted with his purpose), ought to expostulate with him
and say, “Brother! do not inter rupt the harmony of the assembly! do not devise
ex pedients for this purpose! do not consider the best means of doing this
mischief! holding to it and persevering in it. Brother! There ought to be
harmony in the community, peace and not wrangling, as the learner of one
master; agreeing, as milk combines with water; so combining in the law of
Buddha! There is profit and rest in so doing I” If the (wicked) monk, at the
time of being thus exhorted, still keep to his purpose, and relinquish it not,
the other must expostulate three times, in order to induce the first to lay
aside his purpose; if, after the third warning, he give up his intention, it is
well! but if not, let him be suspended.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss11">Saṅghādisesa 11</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="33"></a>
If a monk have formod a cabal, say of one, two, or three, or more (brothers),
and if he shall thus address the other (who has been expostulating with some
offender), Brother, do not chide this monk, he is a good man, and speaks
according to the law and precepts. What he says I and others approve of and
rejoice at.” Then the first shall reply, expostulating, thus, “Brother! say not
so! say not that this monk is in agreement with the law and precepts; say not
you approve and rejoice at what he says, for in truth this monk is an opposer
of the Law in saying what he does; he is a transgressor of the precepts!
Brother! do not desire thus to break the harmony of the community! you ought,
indeed, to rejoice at, and desire to see harmony amongst the brethren. Brother!
amongst monks there should be peace and not wrangling! learners of one master,
as milk mingles with water, so should it be in the law of Buddha, having peace
there is great prosperity!” If, at the time of this warning, the other still
hold his resolve, let the expostulation be repeated three times, etc.; if he
hear, well! if not, let him be suspended!</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss12">Saṅghādisesa 12</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="34"></a>
If a monk, depending on (or attached to) a certain village (or, it may be, an
assembly of monks"), live (in a fixed habitation) in a city or town, and
pollute the house in which he lives, walking disorderly, so that all see it and
hear it, all the monks ought to converse with this monk, and say, “Brother!
you have polluted the family in which you reside; your conduct is disorderly;
all men see it, and talk of it. Now, you are able to leave this monastery
(assembly) and go elsewhere; you may not live in this community/ These monks so
speaking, and that one replying, “Brothers! this community is one-sided
(through love), is full of anger, wishes to terrify, is foolish; there are
other monks guilty of this same fault, some are ex pelled, and some not.” Then
all the monks, chiding him, shall say, “Brother! say not so, that in this
community there are monks of such character, whereas it is not the case.
Brother, it is your disorderly conduct which all men see and talk about (that
is the cause of our speaking as we do).” Thus if he, at the time of this
warning, still hold his opinion, let it be repeated three times; if he retract
and repent, well! if not, let him be suspended.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss13">Saṅghādisesa 13</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="35"></a>
If a monk, of a bad disposition, will not bear being spoken to, according to
the direction of the law of precepts, and if, when all the monks have
expostulated with him on this account, he reply, “Brother, do not talk thus at
me! whether I am right or wrong! I also will say nothing to you, whether right
or wrong. Brother, be agreed (or satisfied), do not find fault!” Those monks,
addressing him, shall say, “Brother! refuse not to receive our appeal! a
brother ought to receive the word of (kind) expostulation. Brother! as the law
corrects all the monks, so would all the monks, according to the law,
expostulate with our brother. So the disciples of Buddha shall all receive
profit, correcting each other in turn for their faults, and mutually inviting
each other to further repentance.” These monks thus speaking to him, if he
still hold by his opinion after three warnings, let him be suspended.</p>
<hr>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="36"></a>
Monks! thus have I repeated the thirteen Saṅghādisesa ordinances: the first
nine (to be inflicted) for the first offence, the others after three warnings.
If a monk have broken any one of the laws (above named), and wil fully
concealed it, he ought to be placed under compulsory solitary confinement (<i>pravāsa</i>),
after which he should pass six nights of <i>mānatta</i> penance. After this he
ought to be absolved. Twenty monks in conclave may absolve him; if only one
person short of twenty come together, he shall not be absolved; and in this
case all the monks shall be considered blameworthy. This is the law. I now ask
all the venerable ones in this assembly, are you pure or not (three times)?
Venerable ones! this assembly is pure Silently therefore ye stand! So let it
be.</p>
<h2><span class="add"><a id="an">2 aniyata rules</a></span></h2>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="37"></a>
Venerable monks! the following rules relate to faults not capable of exact
definition; they are two in number, and are found in the Vinaya, and are
ordered to be repeated fortnightly (requiring suspension or penance according
to the case).</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="an1">Aniyata 1</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="38"></a>
If a monk (monk) occupy a screened and sheltered place, in common with a woman,
and sit in a spot fit for the commission of sin, and at the same time indulge
in licentious (unlawful) conversation with her if, for example, she be a
faithful lay woman (<i>upāsika</i>) and they converse together on matters
relating to the three laws, viz., pārājika, saṅghādisesa, pācittiya; and if
this monk, sitting in the manner mentioned, say of his own accord: “I have
broken these laws, and am therefore liable to the several punishments attached
to the transgression, whether entire exclusion, or suspension and penance, or
public confession,” then according to what this faithful laywoman shall report,
respecting the crimes which the monk has acknowledged, such shall be his
punishment.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="an2">Aniyata 2</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="39"></a>
If a monk consort with a woman in an open place, unfit for the commission of
crime, but talk loosely with her, for example with a well-principled laywoman
about the two laws, sanghadisesa, and pācittiya, and say respecting each of
these of his own accord: “I have broken these laws and am liable to the
punishment attached to such transgression” this monk shall be punished
according to what the faithful laywoman reports. This also is a case in point.</p>
<hr>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="40"></a>
Venerable monks! I have thus declared these two rules called undetermined. I
demand of you all, is this assembly pure or not (three times). Venerable ones!
this assembly is pure, and therefore you are silent. So let it be.</p>
<h2><span class="add"><a id="np">30 nissaggiya pācittiya rules</a></span></h2>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="41"></a>
Venerable monks! I now proceed to declare the thirty Nissaggiya-pācittiya
dhamma, to be recited fortnightly, as contained in the midst of the Vinaya (or
book of precepts).</p>
<h3><span class="add">Chapter 1</span></h3>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np1">Nissaggiya Pācittya 1</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="42"></a>
If a monk, having finished a set of robes for himself, the Kathina cloth having
been distributed, be presented with an additional garment, he may retain it
ten days without consecration, but if he keep it beyond that time, it is
nissaggiya pācittiya.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np2">Nissaggiya Pācittya 2</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="43"></a>
If a monk, having finished a set of robes for himself, the Katina cloth having
been distributed, if he be short of either of the three, leaving one here and
another there, except by permission of a Sangha-Kamma: this is nissaggiya
pācittiya.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np3">Nissaggiya Pācittya 3</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="44"></a>
If a monk, after completing his robes, and the dis tribution of the Katina
cloth, be offered a garment out of the regular time, if he desire it he may
take it; having received it, let it be quickly made up. If it be enough to make
him a robe, well! but if not, he may keep the piece by him a whole month, in
order to obtain a further piece to make up the deficiency; but if he keep it
longer than a month, it is nissaggiya pācittiya.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np4">Nissaggiya Pācittya 4</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="45"></a>
If a monk receive a piece of cloth from a bhikṣuṇī, not related to him, except
in the way of justifiable exchange, it is nissaggiya pācittiya.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np5">Nissaggiya Pācittya 5</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="46"></a>
If a monk send one of his robes to a bhikṣuṇī, not a relative, to be washed or
smoothed after it has been dyed, it is nissaggiya pācittiya.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np6">Nissaggiya Pācittya 6</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="47"></a>
If a monk ask a robe from a householder not a relative of his, or from the
householder’s wife, except on special occasions, it is nissaggiya pācittiya.
The special occasions are when his robe has been stolen, or lost, or burnt, or
blown away.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np7">Nissaggiya Pācittya 7</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="48"></a>
If a monk, under such circumstances, shall by any unguarded expression intimate
a wish that this householder or his wife, neither of them being related to
him, should give him a robe (or cloth for a robe), this monk may receive a just
equivalent (for that which he has lost); if he takes more, it is nissaggiya
pācittiya.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np8">Nissaggiya Pācittya 8</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="49"></a>
If a householder or his wife shall have collected money in order to provide a
robe for a particular monk, and if this monk, before receiving it, and without
any invitation, go to the house of the master of the family, and speak thus to
him, “Excellent householder! purchase such and such a robe and give it me,
because it is good!” If he obtain his request, it is nissaggiya pācittiya.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np9">Nissaggiya Pācittya 9</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="50"></a>
If two householders or their wives shall have collected money to buy a robe to
give to a particular monk, and if that monk before receiving it, and at his own
invitation, go to the residences of these householders, and speak thus:
“Excellent Sirs! I pray you purchase such and such pieces of cloth for me,
because they will together make me one beautiful robe!” if he obtain his
request, it is nissagiya pācittiya.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np10">Nissaggiya Pācittya 10</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="51"></a>
If a king, or chief minister, or a Brahman (or) a householder, or a householder
s wife, send to a particular monk a messenger with a present of money for the
purchase of cloth, and if the messenger come to the monk and say, “Venerable
sir, will you receive from me at once the purchase money for a robe, with which
I am entrusted for you?” and the monk reply, “It is allowable for me to
procure for myself a robe, at the proper time, then we receive consecrated
(cloth),” to which the messenger rejoins: “Venerable Sir! have you any man of
business here?” and the monk says: “yes,” whether it be somebody belonging to
the monk’s garden, or a upāsaka (layman), who is accustomed to look after the
secular affairs of the monks; and in consequence the messenger go to the place
where such a person lives, and having entrusted the money to his care, come
back to the presence of the monk and say: “Venerable Sir, I have given the
money for purchasing a robe into the hands of such and such a person whom you
named; Venerable Sir! at the right time go to him, and you shall receive the
robe you require.” That monk needing a robe may go two or three times to the
place of his trustee to remind him of his necessity, and if he procure the
robe, well and good! but if not, he may go a fourth, fifth and sixth time, and
stand silently before him, and then go away. If this causes the man to
recollect his debt, well and good! but if the monk does not even thus procure
the robe, and go back after this to the man to try to get it this is nissaggiya
pācittiya. If he do not obtain the robe, he may either go himself, or send a
messenger to the place whence the gift came and say: “The money which you sent
some time ago as a present for the purchase of a robe for a particular monk,
and which you entrusted to the care of such and such a person, has not been
used for the benefit of the monk in question, you should go back and take it
therefore, lest it be lost.” Such is the rule.</p>
<h3><span class="add">Chapter 2</span></h3>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np11">Nissaggiya Pācittya 11</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="52"></a>
If a monk make a new coverlet for himself out of mixed silk, it is nissaggiya
pācittiya.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np12">Nissaggiya Pācittya 12</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="53"></a>
If a monk make a coverlet out of the fresh and un mixed wool of the black
Tartar sheep, it is nissaggiya pācittiya.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np13">Nissaggiya Pācittya 13</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="54"></a>
If a monk make a new coverlet for himself he ought to use two parts of pure
black wool, three parts of white, and four parts brown or tawny. If he do not
observe this proportion, it is nissaggiya pachittrya.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np14">Nissaggiya Pācittya 14</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="55"></a>
If a monk make a new coverlet for himself, he ought to keep it fully six years;
if because he has not got rid of it within the six years, he makes himself a
new one, except by permission of a Sangha-kamma; this is nissaggiya pachitiya.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np15">Nissaggiya Pācittya 15</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="56"></a>
If a monk make a new seat-cover, he ought to take an old piece, one span in
length and breadth, and patch it over the new, in order to destroy its
appearance; if in making a new seat-cover he does not follow his rule it is
nissaghiya patchittiya.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np16">Nissaggiya Pācittya 16</a></span></h4>
<p>

A man fully twenty years of age may be permitted to undertake the full
ordination. If a monk not fully twenty years old, present himself for
ordination, this man cannot be received into orders, the presiding monk is to
be blamed, on account of the foolish mistake, and (the whole transaction) is
pācittiya.</p>

If a monk speak in this way: “I know with respect to the laws which Buddha
preached, that the indulgence of lustful desires is no real impediment to their
fulfilment” then another monk shall chide him and say: “Excellent sir! speak
not so! you should not thus calumniate the world- honoured one. It is not right
to do so. The world-honoured one has made no such assertion, but on the
contrary, in numberless ways (modes of salvation) he has said that the
indulgence of lust is an impediment in the way of religious progress.” This
protest should be repeated three times, in case no impression is made; if,
after that, the first monk give up his false opinion, well; but if he does not,
it is pācittiya.</p>

<a class="sc" id="138"></a>
If a monk knowing a man who talks in the way described above, who does not keep
the law, and who holding such false views, refuses to forsake them, bestows
upon such an one any thing in charity, has any religious communion with him, or
lodges and converses with him, it is pācittiya.</p>

<p>
<a class="sc" id="139"></a>
If a monk, knowing that a novice uses similar language, he ought to speak to
him and say: “You should not use such language! You should not calumniate the
world-honoured one! It is not right to do so; the world-honoured one never used
the words you say he did. Novice! the world-honored one, in numberless modes
of doctrine, always said that lust is a great obstacle in the way of religion.”
The novice, thus corrected, refusing to amend, should be warned three times,
and if after this he repent, well; but if not, he ought to be spoken to thus:
“You are from this time forth no disciple of Buddha! You may not join yourself
with the other monks, as the other novices do; nor is it permitted you to help
the Great monks during two or three nights; you are now discharged from these
duties; you are at liberty to go; you may go for good; you cannot remain here.”
If any monk, knowing that the novice has been thus rejected, associate with
him, or suffer him to dwell with him, it is pācittiya.</p>

If a monk, at a time when the other monks are going through the form of
religious expostulation, speak thus: “Excellent sirs! I cannot now learn this
law. I purpose going to some one of eminent wisdom, who observes the precepts,
to put some difficulties to him by way of query.” This is pācittiya. If there
are any explanations necessary, they ought to be sought for at once.</p>

If a monk, when the precepts are being recited, speak in some such way as this:
“Brethren! what use is there in repeating these various and minute precepts?

and engender doubts!” To trifle with and speak contemptuously of the precepts
in this way is pācittiya.</p>

If a monk, at the time when the precepts are being recited, speak in this
manner: “Brethren! I am now getting perfect in these laws; this book of
precepts ordered to be recited fortnightly, is taken from the midst of the
Vinaya!” And if the other monks, knowing that this monk has twice or thrice
during the session when the precepts have been recited (spoken thus): “How many
more times are those monks without knowledge and with no explanation (going to
repeat these precepts)?” If such a monk has been guilty of any fault (although
he refuses to answer in the public confession) still he shall be dealt with
according to the law; and in addition shall be convicted of the fault of
extreme ignorance (and be censured thus): “Brother! this conduct is
unprofitable, and you act improperly! You do not attend whilst the precepts are
recited; you shut your ears, and will not listen to the law.” This crime of
ignorance is pācittiya.</p>

Venerable sirs! I have thus recited the ninety pācittiya laws; I now ask the
entire assembly of monks, are ye pure from violation of these laws or not
[three times]. Venerable sirs! This assembly is pure, and therefore ye are
silent. So let it be.</p>
<h2><span class="add"><a id="pd">4 pātidesanīya rules</a></span></h2>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="161"></a>
Venerable sirs! The following four rules known as pātidesanīya are ordered to
be recited fortnightly, and are taken from the Vinaya, or Book of Precepts.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="pd1">Pātidesanīya 1</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="162"></a>
If a monk, in good health, enter a village and receive with his own hands food
to eat from a bhikṣuṇī, not related to him, and eat it: this monk ought to
confess his fault in the presence of the other monks, and say: “Venerable sirs!
I have transgressed by bringing contempt on the law; I ought not to have done
so; I now confess my fault to the venerable monks. This is called pātidesanīya.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="pd2">Pātidesanīya 2</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="163"></a>
If a monk go to a layman’s house to eat, and a bhikṣuṇī, present in the same
house, point out with her finger, and say: “Give this gruel to such and such an
one;” or, “Give this rice to such and such an one,” the monks generally ought
to speak to that bhikṣuṇī, and say: “Worthy sister! be still; wait till the
monks have done eating.” If there be no monk (who has the courage) to speak
thus to that bhikṣuṇī, then the one present (or the monks who are present)
ought to confess their fault before the other monks, and say: “Venerable sirs!
I have transgressed and brought contempt on the law; I ought not to have done
so; I now confess my fault before the venerable brethren.” This is
pātidesanīya.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="pd3">Pātidesanīya 3</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="164"></a>
If certain families have been appointed by the assembly of monks to the houses
of resort (whether for study or otherwise) for the monks, and if a monk,
knowing such a family, go, whilst in good health, and with out any invitation,
and receive in his hand food and eat it, this monk ought to confess his fault
in the presence of the others, and say: “Venerable sirs! I have broken the law,
and brought it into contempt, which I ought not to have done. I now confess my
fault to you, venerable sirs! This is pātidesanīya.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="pd4">Pātidesanīya 4</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="165"></a>
If a monk reside at a distance in a dangerous place, as a solitary ascetic, and
do not previously warn his patrons, who reside beyond the precincts of his
monastery, that they must not bring him food, and (in the face of the danger)
reside within his precinct, and receive food there and eat it, except he is
sick, this monk shall confess his fault to the rest, and say: “Venerable sirs!
I have broken the law, and brought it into contempt. I now confess to you my
sin.” This is pātidesanīya.</p>

Venerable sirs! I have now recited the four pātidesanīyas, and I ask this
venerable assembly if it is free from transgression, or not? [three times]

Excellent Sirs! I have thus recited the Training laws; I now ask you all if
this assembly is pure [three times.] Great Sirs! this assembly is pure!
silently, therefore! so let it be.</p>
<h2><span class="add"><a id="as">Adhikaraṇasamatha</a></span></h2>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="230"></a>
Excellent Sirs! these seven adhikaraṇasamatha laws, taken from the middle of
the Book of Precepts, are to be recited fortnightly. If a monk be embroiled in
a subject or business leading to litigation, he ought to suppress and put an
end to it.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="as1">Adhikaraṇasamatha 1</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="231"></a>
If it be a case that requires the presence of the parties, let the parties be
present.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="as2">Adhikaraṇasamatha 2</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="232"></a>
If the case requires thought and deliberation, let there be deliberation.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="as3">Adhikaraṇasamatha 3</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="233"></a>
If the case require plain and exact sentences, then let there be precision.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="as4">Adhikaraṇasamatha 4</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="234"></a>
If the case requires independent decision, then let there be sentence given.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="as5">Adhikaraṇasamatha 5</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="235"></a>
If the case may be decided by precedent, then let it be so decided.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="as6">Adhikaraṇasamatha 6</a></span></h4>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="236"></a>
If the case may be decided by a majority, then let it be so.</p>

<p>
And in all cases let it be decided finally.</p>

Excellent Sirs! I have thus repeated the seven adhikaraṇasamathas. I now demand
of you all, Is thin assembly pure? [three times]. Brethren! this assembly is
pure; silently, therefore, ye stand. So let it be.</p>
<h2><span class="add"><a id="conc">Conclusion</a></span></h2>
<p>
<a class="sc" id="238"></a>
Worthy Sirs! I have thus recited the Preface to the Sutra of Precepts; I have
repeated the four Pārājika rules, the thirteen Saṅghādisesa rules, the two
Aniyata rules, the thirty Nissagiya-pācittiya rules, the ninety Pācittiya rules
the four Pātidesanīya rules, the one hundred Sekhiya rules, the seven
Adhikaraṇasamatha rules. These, all taken from the Sutra of Precepts, are those
which Buddha has declared ought to be repeated fortnightly. If there be any
other laws of Buddha not herein contained, this assembly is well agreed, they
ought to be observed.</p>
