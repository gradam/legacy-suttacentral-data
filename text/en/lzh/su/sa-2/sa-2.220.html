<h1>Vijayā</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At that time the nun Vijayā left the Rājakārāma Vihāra, took her robes and her begging bowl, and entered the town to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she cleaned her bowl, and gathered her seat <span class="add">for meditation</span>. She went to the Andhavana forest and sat under a tree, for the day’s abiding. At that time King Māra thought: “The renunciant Gotama is staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park. The nun Vijayā took her robes and her begging bowl and entered the town to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she cleaned her bowl, gathered her seat and has gone to the Andhavana forest. <span class="add">Now</span> she is sitting under a tree, for the day’s abiding. I shall disturb her!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>Having thought thus, he transformed himself into a young man and approached her, speaking a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“You are full of vigor, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>I too am young of years.<br>
Let us enjoy the five sensual pleasures together, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>enjoying ourselves as we may!<br>
Why sit here alone, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>why not be with me?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>At that time Vijayā thought: “Who is this who wants to disturb me? What a deceiver! Is he a human or a non-human being?” She entered concentration and using her insight, recognized that it was King Māra. She answered him with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Enjoyment, taking pleasure in song and dance /<br><span class="indent">​</span>enjoyment of the five sensual pleasures:<br>
All this I leave to you; /<br><span class="indent">​</span>I don’t care for it.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>All the pleasures of the human world, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the five sensual pleasures of the heavens:<br>
All this I leave to you; /<br><span class="indent">​</span>I am not for any of these.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>I have cut off all craving, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the darkness of ignorance is destroyed.<br>
Having reached complete cessation. /<br><span class="indent">​</span><span class="add">I</span> peacefully dwell in a state of purity.<br>
Therefore understand: /<br><span class="indent">​</span>Bad One, you are defeated.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>At that time King Māra thought: “This nun knows my mind well!” Depressed, dispirited, and ashamed he returned to his palace.</p>
