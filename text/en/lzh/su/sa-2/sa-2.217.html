<h1>Uppalavaṇṇā</h1>

<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At that time one morning the nun Uppalavaṇṇā took her robes and her begging bowl and entered the town <span class="add">Sāvatthī</span> to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she cleaned her bowl, gathered her seat <span class="add">for meditation</span>. Having washed her feet, she went to the Andhavana forest, and sat upright under a tree, for the day’s abiding.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>At that time King Māra thought: “The renunciant Gotama is staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park. The nun Uppalavaṇṇā took her robes and her begging bowl and entered the town <span class="add">Sāvatthī</span> to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she cleaned her bowl, gathered her seat, and went to the Andhavana forest. She is sitting upright under a tree, for the day’s abiding. I shall disturb her!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Having thought thus he transformed himself into a young man, went to her place and spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Sitting under a Sāla tree, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>beautiful like its blossoms;<br>
All alone <i>bhikkhunī,</i> /<br><span class="indent">​</span>is it that you are you meditating?<br>
Without a companion, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>aren’t you afraid of the ignorant?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>At that time Uppalavaṇṇā thought: “Who is this who wants to disturb me? What a deceiver! Is he a human or a non-human being?” She entered concentration and recognized that it was the Bad One. She spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“A hundred thousand sly and deceitful rogues /<br><span class="indent">​</span>could all do just as much as you.<br>
They could not move me even an inch, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>therefore I stay alone and unafraid.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At that time King Māra again spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“I might hide myself /<br><span class="indent">​</span>within your belly,<br>
Between your brows, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>unseen by you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the nun again replied with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“My mind has attained self-mastery; /<br><span class="indent">​</span>I have practised well the concentration that gives super-natural powers.<br>
Having cut off the great bondages, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>I will never be frightened by you.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>I have cast aside all fetters, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>have pulled out the root of the three taints <span class="add">of attachment, hate and ignorance</span>.<br>
The roots of fear thus gone, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>I am not afraid.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>I abide here, /<br><span class="indent">​</span><span class="add">I</span> have no fear of you.<br>
Bring on your armies all, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>I shall not be afraid.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><span class="add">I have</span> cut off all craving, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the darkness of ignorance destroyed.<br>
Having attained complete cessation, /<br><span class="indent">​</span><span class="add">I</span> peacefully dwell in a state of purity.<br>
Therefore understand: /<br><span class="indent">​</span>Bad One you are defeated.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>At that time the Bad One thought: “The nun Uppalavaṇṇā understands my mind well!” Depressed, dispirited, and ashamed he returned to his palace.</p>
