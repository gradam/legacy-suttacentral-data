<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At that time there was a nun called Upacālā staying in the Rājakārāma Vihāra. One morning she took her robes and her begging bowl and entered Sāvatthī to beg for food. Having finished the alms, she cleaned her bowl, washed her feet, gathered her seat <span class="add">for meditation</span>. She went to the Andhavana forest for the day’s abiding and sat upright under a tree.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>At that time King Māra thought: “These days Gotama the renunciant is staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park. Here now is this nun called Upacālā, who in the morning took her robes and her begging bowl and entered Sāvatthī to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she washed her feet, gathered her seat and went to the Andhavana forest for the day’s abiding. <span class="add">Now</span> she is sitting upright under a tree. I shall go and disturb her!” Having thought thus he transformed himself into a young man, approached her and said: “My lady! In which place do you want to be reincarnated?” The nun answered: “I will not be reincarnated anywhere.” At that time the young man spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“The Tāvatiṃsa and the Yama heavens, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the Tusita, the Nimmānarati<br>
And the heaven Paranimmitavasavattin /<br><span class="indent">​</span>are realms of great happiness and pleasure.<br>
You should vow to enjoy them /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and you will be reborn there as desired.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nun Upacālā said a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“The Tāvatiṃsa and the Yama heaven, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the Tusita, the Nimmānarati<br>
And the heaven Paranimmitavasavattin /<br><span class="indent">​</span><span class="add">those</span> in these places experience pleasures <span class="add">but</span><br>
As long as there is no emancipation from the view of self /<br><span class="indent">​</span>they are <span class="add">still</span> bound by Māra.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>All <span class="add">such</span> worlds are moving, are in flux: /<br><span class="indent">​</span>these too will change and vanish.<br>
The common person cannot /<br><span class="indent">​</span>escape from Māra’s realm.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>All worlds are on fire, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>smoke streaming out from all of them.<br>
Away from the tremors, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>this place I enjoy.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>I have cut off all craving, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the darkness of ignorance is destroyed.<br>
Having reached complete cessation, /<br><span class="indent">​</span><span class="add">I</span> peacefully dwell in a state of purity.<br>
Therefore understand: /<br><span class="indent">​</span>Bad One, you are defeated.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>At that time King Māra thought: “This nun knows my mind well!” Depressed, dispirited, and ashamed, he returned to his palace.</p>
