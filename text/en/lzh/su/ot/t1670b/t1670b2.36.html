<h1>2.36 The Taste of Salt</h1>
</div>
<p>The king again asked Nāgasena, “Can a man know the taste of salt with his eyes?”</p>
<p>Nāgasena said, “Great king, you know whether one can know the taste of the salt with his eyes.”</p>
<p>Then the king said, “The eyes do not know the taste of the salt.”</p>
<p>Nāgasena said, “A man knows the taste of salt by his tongue, not by his eyes.”</p>
<p>“Do all people know the taste by their tongue?”</p>
<p>“People all distinguish different tastes by their tongues”</p>
<p>The king asked, “Is the taste of all salt to be known and distinguished only by the tongue?”</p>
<p>“Yes, the taste of all salt is to be known and distinguished by the tongue.”</p>
<p>“There is salt brought by chariots and there is also salt brought by cows, can the chariots and cows know the taste of salt?”</p>
<p>“The chariot and the cow cannot know the taste of the salt.”</p>
<p>“Can the taste of salt be weighed?” asked the king.</p>
<p>“Is it the king’s knowledge to weigh the taste of salt?”</p>
<p>Then the king replied, “The taste of salt cannot be weighed, but the weight of salt can be weighed.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
