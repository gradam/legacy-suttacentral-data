<h1>2.66. Seven Kinds of Wisdom</h1>
</div>
<p>The king asked Nāgasena again, “By how many ways does one need to learn the Path?”</p>
<p>Nāgasena replied, “One needs to learn the Path in seven ways. What are the seven? They are: (1) thinking of good and evil things, (2) exertion or energy, (3) taking delight in the Dharma, (4) to subdue <a class="t" id="t718a"></a> the mind to do good, (5) thinking of the Path, (6) concentration of the mind, and (7) to take things without attachment or hatred.”</p>
<p>“Is it to know the Path that all these seven ways are practiced?”</p>
<p>“No, not by all these seven ways does one learn. The wise who can distinguish good and evil learn the Path only by one way.”</p>
<p>“Then if one can know the Path by just one way, why are the seven ways all preached?”</p>
<p>Nāgasena asked the king, “Suppose a man were to put a sword in its sheath and place it against a wall, could it cut off anything by itself?”</p>
<p>“No, it could not cut anything by itself.”</p>
<p>“Even so, a person though intelligence can achieve wisdom only with the help of the other six ways.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
