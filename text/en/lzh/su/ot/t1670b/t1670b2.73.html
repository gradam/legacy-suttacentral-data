<h1>2.73. Power of Wisdom</h1>
</div>
<p>The king asked Nāgasena again, “Could one who has attained the Path, ponder over all the subtle, deep, and complicated matters?”</p>
<p>Nāgasena replied, “Yes, one who has attained the Path can ponder over all subtle, abstruse, and profound matters. The Buddha’s Dharma is the most abstruse and profound teaching which contains all aspects of knowledge. All those things can be analyzed by wisdom.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
