<h1>2.52. The Buddha’s Whereabouts after Parinirvana</h1>
</div>
<p>The king asked Nāgasena again, “Is there nirvana?”<a class="t" id="t716a"></a></p>
<p>Nāgasena replied, “Yes, there is nirvana.”</p>
<p>“Can you, Nāgasena, point out where the Buddha is?”</p>
<p>“No, I cannot point out where the Buddha is since the Buddha has already attained parinirvana. It is impossible to show where the Buddha is.”</p>
<p>Then Nāgasena gave a simile, “Suppose a man has lit a fire. When the fire has been extinguished, can anyone point out where the fire has gone?”</p>
<p>“No one can,” said the king.</p>
<p>Nāgasena said, “The Buddha has attained parinirvana and it cannot be pointed out where the Buddha has gone.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
