<p>The king asked Nāgasena again. “For what purpose do your people learn the Dharma and become monks?”</p>
<p>Nāgasena replied, “For the purpose of eradicating past suffering, present suffering, and not wanting to experience it again in the future, I learned the Dharma and become a monk.”</p>
<p>“Future suffering has not yet happened, so why do you prepare to learn the Dharma and become a monk?”</p>
<p>Then Nāgasena asked the king, “Are there, great king, rival countries and opponents who might rise up against you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, there are rival countries and opponents who frequently rise up to fight with me.”</p>
<p>“Then, is it when the enemies are coming, that you, great king, set to work to have weapons prepared, watch towers erected, and moats dug, or are they all prepared earlier?”</p>
<p>“All these had been prepared beforehand.”</p>
<p>“But why had they been prepared beforehand?”</p>
<p>“Because the enemies might come at any time.” <a class="t" id="t717c"></a></p>
<p>“The enemy has not come yet, why do you prepare?”</p>
<p>Nāgasena again asked the king, “Is it when you are hungry, that you then sow, or when you are thirsty, that you then dig a well?”</p>
<p>The king said, “It should be done beforehand.”</p>
<p>Then Nāgasena said, “For a man who is not thirsty, why should he prepare beforehand?”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
