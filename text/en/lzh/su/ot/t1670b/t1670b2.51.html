<h1>2.51. Knowledge of Rebirth</h1>
</div>
<p>The king asked, “Does he who is about to be reborn know that he will be reborn?”</p>
<p>Nāgasena replied, “Yes, he who is to be reborn knows it.”</p>
<p>“But how can he know it?”</p>
<p>“It is like a farming family who sows seeds, and it rains in time. Does the farming family know that there will be plenty of grain?”</p>
<p>“Yes, they know that there will be plenty of grain.”</p>
<p>Then Nāgasena said, “So does a person. He who is about to be reborn knows that he will be reborn.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
