<h1>205. <span class="add">[Discourse on the <i>Udāna</i>]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesālī in Jīvaka’s Mango Grove.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One, having recited all of the verses of the <i>Udāna</i>, said to the venerable Ānanda: “The eye is impermanent, <i>dukkha</i>, of a nature to change and become otherwise. Forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact, and feeling arisen in dependence on eye-contact, be it painful, pleasant, or neutral, is also impermanent, <i>dukkha</i>, of a nature to change and become otherwise.</p>
<p>“The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind <span class="add">is also like this.</span></p>
<p>“A learned noble disciple who contemplates like this becomes liberated from the eye, and also becomes liberated from forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact, and feeling arisen in dependence on eye-contact <span class="add">[be it painful, pleasant, or neutral]</span>. He becomes liberated from the ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind, mental objects, mind-consciousness, mind-contact, and feeling arisen in dependence on mind-contact, be it painful, pleasant, or neutral. I say that he becomes liberated from birth, old age, disease, death, worry, sorrow, vexation, and pain.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
