<h1>201. <span class="add">[Discourse to a Monk]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>Then a certain monk approached the Buddha, paid respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet, withdrew to stand to one side, and said to the Buddha: “Blessed One, knowing what, seeing what, does one step by step reach the quick destruction of the influxes?”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One said to that monk: “One should rightly contemplate impermanence. What kind of things are impermanent? That is, one should contemplate the eye as impermanent, forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact, and feeling arisen in dependence on eye-contact, be it painful, pleasant, or neutral, <span class="add">[that is also]</span> impermanent.</p>
<p>“One should contemplate the ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind as impermanent … mental objects … mind-consciousness, mind-contact, and feeling arisen in dependence on mind-contact, be it painful, pleasant, or neutral, that is also impermanent. Monk, knowing like this, seeing like this, one step by step reaches the destruction of the influxes.”</p>
<p>Then, hearing what the Buddha had said that monk was delighted. He paid respect and left.</p>
<p><span class="add">In the same way, as the discourse spoken to the monk, <span class="add">[other discourses</span><span class="add"> are to be recited]</span> with this difference</span>: “knowing what, seeing what … does one step by step reach the destruction of all fetters … does one abandon all bondages … does one abandon all underlying tendencies … does one abandon all higher afflictions … does one abandon all fetters … does one abandon all flows … does one abandon all yokes … does one abandon all clinging … does one abandon all contacts … does one abandon all hindrances … does one abandon all entanglements … does one abandon all blemishes … does one abandon all craving … does one abandon all <span class="add">[wrong]</span> intentions … does one abandon wrong view and give rise to right view … does one abandon ignorance and give rise to knowledge?”  </p>
<p>“Monk, in this way contemplate the eye as impermanent … <span class="add">up to </span>… knowing like this, seeing like this, one step by step abandons ignorance and gives rise to knowledge.”</p>
<p>Then, hearing what the Buddha had said, that monk was delighted. Being delighted, he paid respect and left.</p>
