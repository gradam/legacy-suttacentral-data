<h1>206. <span class="add">[First Discourse at Jīvaka’s Mango Grove]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesālī in Jīvaka’s Mango Grove.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “You should make a diligent effort at meditation, calm the mind within. Why is that? Monks, in this way diligently practising meditation and calming the mind within, one understands <span class="add">[things]</span> as they really manifest. What does one understand as it really manifests? One understands as it really manifests the eye, and one also understands as they really manifest forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact, and feeling arisen in dependence on eye-contact, be it painful, pleasant, or neutral.</p>
<p>“The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind <span class="add">is also like that</span>. All these things are impermanent and conditioned, and in this way one understands them also as they really manifest.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
