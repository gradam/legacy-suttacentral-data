<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was dwelling in Śrāvastī, in the Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At that time, the Bhagavān told the bhikṣus, “There are four bases of mindfulness. What are these four? That is to say, [1] the base of mindfulness of the body, observing the body; [2] of sensation; [3] of the mind; and [4] the base of mindfulness of dharmas, observing dharmas. Thusly, bhikṣus, these four bases of mindfulness are cultivated to fulfillment. With ardency, mindfulness, and awareness, they should be learned.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>After the Buddha had spoken this sūtra, then the bhikṣus heard what the Buddha had said, and joyfully practiced in accordance.</p>
