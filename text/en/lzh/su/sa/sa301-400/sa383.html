<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time, the Buddha was dwelling in Vārāṇasī, at the Deer Park of Ṛṣipatana.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At that time, the Bhagavān said to the bhikṣus, “There are four noble truths. What are these four? That is to say, [1] the Noble Truth of Suffering, [2] the Noble Truth of the Accumulation of Suffering, [3] the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, and [4] the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“For a bhikṣu, [1] if the Noble Truth of Suffering has been known, it has been understood. [2] If the Noble Truth of the Accumulation of Suffering has been known, it has been severed. [3] If the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering has been known, it has been realized. [4] If the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering has been known, then it has been cultivated.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“For a bhikṣu it is also such as this for severing affection and desire, turning away from various bonds. As for pride, ignorance, etc., they are ultimately with suffering.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>After the Buddha had spoken this sūtra, the bhikṣus heard what the Buddha had said, and joyfully practiced in accordance.</p>
