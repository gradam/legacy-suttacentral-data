<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the Blessed One said to the monks:</p>
<p>“In the past bodily form was impermanent and in the future it will be <span class="add">impermanent</span>, what to say of bodily form in the present! A noble disciple who contemplates like this is not concerned with bodily form in the past and does not rejoice in bodily form in the future. Being disenchanted with bodily form in the present, he becomes free from desire and rightly progresses towards cessation.</p>
<p>“<span class="add">In the same way</span> in the past feeling … perception … formations … consciousness was impermanent and in the future it will be <span class="add">impermanent</span>, what to say of consciousness in the present! A noble disciple who contemplates like this is not concerned with consciousness in the past and does not rejoice in consciousness in the future. Being disenchanted with consciousness in the present, he becomes free from desire and rightly progresses towards cessation.”</p>
<p>(<i>Just as with</i> impermanence, <i>in the same way also for dukkha</i>, emptiness and not-self)</p>
<p>Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, <a class="t" id="t2a"></a> were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
