<h1>4. <span class="add">Second Discourse on Not Understanding</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the Blessed One said to the monks:</p>
<p>“Not understanding bodily form, not having knowledge regarding it, not eradicating <span class="add">desire for</span> it, not being free from desire for it, one will not liberate the mind and be unable to go beyond the dread of birth, old age, disease and death. <span class="add">In the same way</span> not understanding feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, not having knowledge regarding it, not eradicating <span class="add">desire for</span> it, not being free from desire for it, one will not liberate the mind and be unable to go beyond the dread of birth, old age, disease and death.</p>
<p>“Monks, understanding bodily form, having knowledge regarding it, eradicating <span class="add">desire for</span> it, being free from desire for it, one is able to go beyond the dread of birth, old age, disease and death. Monks, understanding it, having knowledge regarding it, being free from desire and lust for it, one will liberate the mind and be able to go beyond the dread of birth, old age, disease and death. <span class="add">In the same way</span> understanding feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, having knowledge regarding it, eradicating <span class="add">desire for</span> it, being free from desire and lust for it, one will liberate the mind and be able to go beyond the dread of birth, old age, disease and death.”</p>
<p>Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
