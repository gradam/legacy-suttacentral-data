<h1>14. <span class="add">Second Discourse on Gratification</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the Blessed One said to the monks:</p>
<p>“In the past I dwelled searching for the gratification in relation to bodily form. I accordingly realized the gratification in relation to bodily form and saw with knowledge and wisdom as it really is the gratification in relation to bodily form. <span class="add">In the same way</span> I dwelled searching for the gratification in relation to feeling … perception … formations … consciousness. I accordingly realized the gratification in relation to feeling … perception … formations … consciousness and saw with knowledge and wisdom as it really is the gratification in relation to consciousness.</p>
<p>“Monks, I dwelled searching for the danger in relation to bodily form. I accordingly realized the danger in relation to bodily form and saw with knowledge and wisdom as it really is the danger in relation to bodily form. <span class="add">In the same way</span> I dwelled searching for the danger in relation to feeling … perception … formations … consciousness. I accordingly realized the danger in relation to consciousness and saw with knowledge and wisdom as it really is the danger in relation to consciousness.</p>
<p>“Monks, I dwelled searching for the escape from bodily form. I accordingly realized the escape from bodily form and saw with knowledge and wisdom as it really is the escape from bodily form. <span class="add">In the same way</span> I dwelled searching for the escape from feeling … perception … formations … consciousness. I accordingly realized the escape from feeling … perception … formations … consciousness and saw with knowledge and wisdom as it really is the escape from feeling … perception … formations … consciousness.</p>
<p>“Monks, <span class="add">as long as</span> I had not understood as it really is the gratification in relation to the five aggregates of clinging as gratification, the danger as danger and the escape as escape, among gods, Māra, Brahmā, recluses, brahmins and the assemblies of gods and humans I was not liberated, was not released, had not gone beyond, was forever dwelling in <span class="add">mental</span> distortion and was unable to declare of myself that I had attained supreme and right awakening.</p>
<p>“Monks, because I had understood as it really is the gratification in relation to the five aggregates of clinging as gratification, the danger as danger and the escape as escape, among gods and humans, Māra, Brahmā, recluses, brahmins and the assemblies of gods and humans I was liberated, <a class="t" id="t3a"></a> was released, had gone beyond, was forever dwelling without <span class="add">mental</span> distortion and was able to declare of myself that I had attained supreme and right awakening.”</p>
<p>Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
