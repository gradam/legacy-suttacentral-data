<h1>59. <span class="supplied">Discourse on Arising and Ceasing</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “There are five aggregates of clinging. What are the five? They are the bodily form aggregate of clinging … the feeling … the perception … the formations … the consciousness aggregate of clinging.</p>
<p>“<span class="supplied">Monks</span>, contemplate these five aggregates of clinging, their nature to arise and cease, that is: ‘This is bodily form, this is the arising of bodily form, this is the cessation of bodily form; this is feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, this is the arising of consciousness, this is the cessation of consciousness.’</p>
<p>“What is the arising of bodily form? What is the cessation of bodily form? What is the arising of feeling … perception … formations … consciousness? What is the cessation of feeling … perception … formations … consciousness?</p>
<p>“With the arising of craving and delight, bodily form arises; with the cessation of craving and delight, bodily form ceases. With the arising of contact, feeling … perception … formations arise; with the cessation of contact, feeling … perception … formations cease. With the arising of name-and-form, consciousness arises; with the cessation of name-and-form, consciousness ceases.</p>
<p>“Monks, in this way bodily form arises and bodily form ceases, this is the arising of bodily form and the cessation of bodily form. In this way feeling … perception … formations … consciousness arises and feeling … perception … formations … consciousness ceases, this is the arising of feeling … perception … formations … consciousness and the cessation of feeling … perception … formations … consciousness.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
