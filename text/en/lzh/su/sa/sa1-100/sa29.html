<h1>29. <span class="add">Discourse on Samiddhi Asking How to Speak as a Dharma Teacher</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time a certain monk by the name of Samiddhi approached the Buddha, paid homage with his head at the <span class="add">Buddha’s</span> feet and withdrew to stand at one side. He said to the Buddha: “As the Blessed One has spoken about speaking as a Dharma teacher—how is one reckoned to be speaking as a Dharma teacher?”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to the monk: “You now wish to know the meaning of speaking as a Dharma teacher. Is it like this?” The monk said to the Buddha: “Indeed, Blessed One.”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to the monk: “Listen and pay careful attention to what I will tell you. If a monk speaks of disenchantment in regard to bodily form, of being free from desire for it, of its cessation, this is reckoned speaking as a Dharma teacher. <span class="add">In the same way</span> speaking of disenchantment in regard to feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, of being free from desire for it, of its cessation, this is reckoned speaking as a Dharma teacher.”</p>
<p>Then that monk, hearing what the Buddha had said, was thrilled with delight, paid homage and left.</p>
