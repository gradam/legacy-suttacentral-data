<h1>5. <span class="add">Third Discourse on Not Understanding</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the Blessed One said to the monks:</p>
<p>“One who craves for and delights in bodily form, craves for and delights in <i>dukkha</i>. One who craves for and delights in <i>dukkha</i> will not attain liberation from <i>dukkha</i>, will not have knowledge and become free from desire for it. <span class="add">In the same way</span> one who craves for and delights in feeling … perception … formations … consciousness craves for and delights in <i>dukkha</i>. One who craves for and delights in <i>dukkha</i> will not attain liberation from <i>dukkha</i>.</p>
<p>“Monks, one who does not crave for or delight in bodily form, does not delight in <i>dukkha</i>. One who does not delight in <i>dukkha</i> will attain liberation from <i>dukkha</i>. <span class="add">In the same way</span> one who does not crave for or delight in feeling … perception … formations … consciousness does not delight in <i>dukkha</i>. One who does not delight in <i>dukkha</i> will attain liberation from <i>dukkha</i>.</p>
<p>“Monks, not understanding bodily form, not having knowledge regarding it, not being free from desire and lust for it, the mind will not be liberated. One who has not liberated the mind from lust will not be able to eradicate <i>dukkha</i>. <span class="add">In the same way</span> not understanding feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, not having knowledge regarding it, not being free from desire and lust for it, one will not liberate the mind and will not be able to eradicate <i>dukkha</i>.</p>
<p>“Understanding bodily form, having knowledge regarding it, being free from desire and lust for it, one will attain liberation of the mind and be able to eradicate <i>dukkha</i>. <span class="add">In the same way</span> understanding feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, having knowledge regarding it, being free from desire and lust for it, one will attain liberation of the mind and be able to eradicate <i>dukkha</i>.” <a class="t" id="t1c"></a></p>
<p>Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
