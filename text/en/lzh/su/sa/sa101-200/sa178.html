<h1>178. <span class="supplied">[Discourse on Already Arisen Evil and Unwholesome States]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “It is just as if a person's turban is burning with fire, what could help him?”</p>
<p>The monks said to the Buddha: “Blessed One, he should arouse supreme desire, zeal, and energy at that time to help him to get it extinguished.”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to the monks: “Although one might still forget about one's turban burning, one should extinguish and eradicate the thriving fire of impermanence. For the sake of eradicating the fire of impermanence, one should eradicate already arisen evil and unwholesome states, giving rise to desire and energy, taking hold of the mind to bring about its growth.</p>
<p>For the sake of eradicating what impermanent states and for the sake of eradicating what already arisen evil and unwholesome states does one give rise to desire and energy, taking hold of the mind to bring about its growth? That is, one should therefore eradicate impermanent bodily form … feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, so as to eradicate already arisen evil and unwholesome states, giving rise to desire and energy, taking hold of the mind to bring about its growth.” <i>To be recited in full up to</i>: When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
<p><i>Just as the discourse on </i>“what is impermanent”, <i>in the same way </i>“what is impermanent and of the past”, “what is impermanent and of the future”, “what is impermanent and of the present”, “what is impermanent and of the past and the future”, “what is impermanent and of the past and the present”, “what is impermanent and of the future and the present”, “what is impermanent and of the past, the future, and the present”, <i>eight discourses are also to be recited as above</i>.</p>
<p><i>Just as </i>“one should therefore eradicate already arisen evil and unwholesome states”, <i>in the same way </i>“for the not arising of not yet arisen evil and unwholesome states”, “for the arising of not yet arisen wholesome states”, “for increasing already arisen wholesome states, one gives rise to desire and energy, taking hold of the mind to bring about its growth”, <i>eight discourses are also to be recited as above.</i></p>
<p><i>Just as the thirty-two discourses on </i>“one should eradicate what is impermanent”, <i>in the same way for </i>“one should understand”, “one should vomit out”, “one should extinguish”, “one should end”, “one should relinquish”, “one should make cease”, “one should make disappear” <i>thirty-two discourses are to be recited for each of these in full as above.</i></p>
