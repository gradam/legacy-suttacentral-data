<h1>125. <span class="add">[Discourse on What is Made by Māra]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Mount Makula, at that time being with an attendant monk by the name of Rādha.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One said to the monk Rādha: “Whatever bodily form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, it is all completely made by Māra. Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <span class="add">is also like this</span>.</p>
<p>The Buddha said to Rādha: “What do you think, is bodily form permanent or is it impermanent?”</p>
<p>He replied: “It is impermanent, Blessed One.”</p>
<p>[The Buddha] asked again: “What is impermanent, is it <i>dukkha</i>?”</p>
<p>He replied: “It is <i>dukkha</i>, Blessed One.”</p>
<p>[The Buddha] asked again: “Is feeling … perception … formations … consciousness permanent or is it impermanent?”</p>
<p>He replied: “It is impermanent, Blessed One.”</p>
<p>[The Buddha] asked again: “What is impermanent, is it <i>dukkha</i>?”</p>
<p>He replied: “It is <i>dukkha</i>, Blessed One.”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to Rādha: “What is impermanent, <i>dukkha</i>, of a nature to change, would a learned noble disciple herein regard it as the self, as distinct from the self <span class="add">[in the sense of being owned by it]</span>, as existing <span class="add">[within the self, or the self]</span> as existing <span class="add">[within it]</span>?”</p>
<p>He replied: “No, Blessed One.”</p>
<p>[The Buddha said]: “Therefore, Rādha, a learned noble disciple gives rise to disenchantment with bodily form. Because of being disenchanted, he does not delight in it. He gives rise to disenchantment with feeling … perception … formations … consciousness. Because of being disenchanted, he does not delight in it. Because of not delighting in it, he becomes liberated. Being liberated he knows and sees: 'Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of any further existence.'”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monk Rādha was delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
<p>A third discourse is also like this, with the difference:35 The Buddha said to Rādha: “A learned noble disciples examines these five aggregates of clinging as not self and not belonging to a self.36 Having examined them, he does not cling to anything in the whole world. Because of not clinging, he is not attached. Because of not being attached, he personally realizes Nirvāṇa, <span class="add">[knowing]</span>: 'Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of any further existence.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monk Rādha was delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
