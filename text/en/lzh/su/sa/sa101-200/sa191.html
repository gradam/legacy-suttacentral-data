<h1>191. <span class="add">[Second Discourse on the Eye]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “One who does not discern and does not understand the eye, does not abandon and does not become free from desire for it, is not capable of going beyond the <i>dukkha</i> of birth, old age, disease, and death. One who does not discern and does not understand the ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind, does not abandon and does not become free from desire for it, is not capable of going beyond the <i>dukkha</i> of birth, old age, disease, and death.</p>
<p>“Monks, one who discerns and understands the eye, who abandons and becomes free from desire for it, is capable of going beyond the <i>dukkha</i> of birth, old age, disease, and death. One who discerns and understands the ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind, who abandons and becomes free from desire for it, is capable of going beyond the <i>dukkha</i> of birth, old age, disease, and death.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
