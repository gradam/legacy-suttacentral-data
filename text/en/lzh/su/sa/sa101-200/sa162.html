<h1>162. <span class="supplied">[Discourse on the View of Acting]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “The existence of what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached to what, by seeing what as the self, do living beings have a view like this and speak like this: 'For one who acts, instructs [someone] to act, destroys, instructs [someone] to destroy, scorches, instructs [someone] to scorch, kills, instructs [someone] to kill, harms living beings, steals the wealth of others, engages in sexual misconduct, knowingly speaks falsehood, drinks liquor, breaks through a wall or destroys a [door] lock to steal, turns back on a road [to ambush someone], harms a village, harms a city, harms people by using a wheel with extremely sharp blades to cut, slash, chop, and slice them up, creating a great heap of flesh, for one who undertakes such practice there is no evil because of this, and also no incurring of evil. Going along the southern [bank] of the Ganges river killing and harming, or coming along the northern [bank] of the Ganges river performing a great sacrifice, because of that there is no merit or evil and there is no incurring of merit or evil. Making offerings, disciplining oneself, protecting [others], acting for the benefit [of others] or for mutual benefit, with these actions one does not create merit?'”</p>
<p>The monks said to the Buddha: “The Blessed One is the root of the Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma …” <i>to be recited fully in the same way in the sequence of the above three discourses.</i></p>
