<h1>123. <span class="add">[Discourse on Craving, Delight, and Lust]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Mount Makula. Then an attendant monk by the name of Rādha approached the Buddha, paid respect at the Buddha's feet, withdrew to sit at one side, and said to the Buddha:</p>
<p>“It would be well if the Blessed One would teach me the essentials of the Dharma in brief. Having heard the Dharma, I shall alone in a quiet place single-mindedly reflect on it, becoming established in it without negligence, <span class="add">[so that I attain that]</span> for the sake of which a clansman's son shaves off beard and hair, wears the dyed robes on his body, goes forth out of right faith into homelessness to train in the path and with increased energy cultivates the holy life, sees the Dharma and personally knows and realizes that: 'Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of any further existence.'”</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to Rādha: “It is well, Rādha, that you are able to inquire after such a matter in front of the Buddha. Listen and pay careful attention to what I shall tell you. Rādha, you should understand identity (<i>sakkāya</i> ), the arising of identity, the cessation of identity, and the path to the cessation of identity. “What is identity? That is, it is the five aggregates of clinging ― the bodily form aggregate of clinging … the feeling … the perception … the formations … the consciousness aggregate of clinging.</p>
<p>“What is the arising of identity? That is, it is craving conjoined with lust and delight for future becoming, delighting with craving here and there. This is called the arising of identity.</p>
<p>“What is the cessation of identity? That is, it is the abandoning without remainder, giving up, vomiting out, eradication, fading away, appeasing, and vanishing of craving conjoined with lust and delight for future becoming, delighting with craving here and there. This is called the cessation of identity.</p>
<p>“What is path to the cessation of identity? That is, it is the eightfold right path ― right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. This is called the path to the cessation of identity.</p>
<p>“You should understand identity, you should abandon the arising of identity, you should realize the cessation of identity, and you should cultivate the path to the cessation of identity.</p>
<p>“Rādha, if a learned noble disciple has understood and abandoned identity, has understood and abandoned the arising of identity, has understood and realized the cessation of identity, has understood and cultivated the path to the cessation of identity, Rādha, <span class="add">[then]</span> he is said to have abandoned craving, to have become free from craving, to have stopped the continuity of bondage, to have rightly comprehended (<i>abhisameti</i> ) conceit, and <span class="add">[to have reached]</span> the unsurpassed transcendence of <i>dukkha</i>.”</p>
<p>Hearing what the Buddha had said, the monk Rādha was delighted and received it respectfully. He rose from his seat, paid respect, and left. Having been instructed by the Blessed One in this way, the monk Rādha alone in a quiet place single-mindedly reflected on it. <span class="add">[He attained that]</span> for the sake of which a clansman's son shaves off beard and hair, wears the dyed robes, goes forth out of right faith into homelessness to train in the path and with increased energy cultivates the holy life. He saw the Dharma and personally knew and realized that: 'Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of any further existence.' He became an arahant with the mind being well liberated.</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monk Rādha was delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
