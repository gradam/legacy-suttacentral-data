<h1>190. <span class="add">[First Discourse on the Eye]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.  </p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “If one does not discern and does not understand the eye, does not abandon and does not become free from desire for it, one is not capable of rightly eradicating <i>dukkha</i>.</p>
<p>“The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind <span class="add">is also like this.</span></p>
<p>“Monks, one who discerns and understands the eye, and who abandons and becomes free from desire for it, is capable of rightly eradicating <i>dukkha</i>. One who knows and understands the ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind, and who abandons and becomes free from desire for it, is capable of rightly eradicating <i>dukkha</i>.”  </p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.  </p>
