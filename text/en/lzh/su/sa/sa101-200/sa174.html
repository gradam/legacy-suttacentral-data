<h1>174. <span class="add">[Discourse on Seeking Out the Great Teacher]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “For the sake of eradicating impermanent things, one should seek out the great teacher. What things are impermanent? That is, bodily form is an impermanent thing. For the sake of eradicating that thing, one should seek out the great teacher. Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <span class="add">is also like this</span>.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
<p><span class="add">In the same way </span>[for the sake of eradicating impermanent things of the] past … future … present … past and future … past and present … future and present … past, future, and present one should seek out the great teacher.  <span class="add">Eight types of discourses <span class="add">[in total]</span> are in the same way. </span> </p>
<p><span class="add">[Just as one seeks out the great teacher, in the same way] in various modes <span class="add">[discourses should be recited]</span> </span>on: “the one who instructs accordingly”, “the peaceful one”, “the widely peaceful one”, “the totally peaceful one”, “the one who has mastered”, “the one who has widely mastered”, “the one who has ultimately mastered”, “the one who explains”, “the one who widely explains”, “the one who explains accordingly”, “the one who is one's second companion”, “the true friend”, “the trustworthy one”, “the one with empathy”, “the compassionate one”, “the one lofty in meaning”, “the one lofty in comfort”, “the <span class="add">[one lofty in]</span> happiness”, “the one lofty in experience”, “the one lofty in tranquillity”, “the one who wishes <span class="add">[one's welfare]</span>”, “the energetic one”, “the expedient one”, “the widely expedient one”, “the capably expedient one”, “the firm one”, “the strong one”, “the vigorous one”, “the courageous one”, “the bodily and mentally courageous one”, “the one difficult to conquer”, “the receptive one”, “the one who constantly trains himself”, “the one who is not negligent”, “the cultivated one”, “the attentive one”, “the mindful one”, “the awakened one”, “the understanding one”, “the knowing one”, “the wise one”, “the eloquent one”, “the thoughtful one”, “the one who lives the holy life”, “the one with <span class="add">[the bases of]</span> supernormal power”, “the one established in mindfulness”, “the one with right effort”, “the one with the <span class="add">[five]</span> faculties”, “the one with the <span class="add">[five]</span> powers”, “the one with the <span class="add">[seven factors of]</span> awakening”, “the one with the <span class="add">[eight factors of]</span> the path”, “the one with tranquillity”, “the one with insight”, “the one with mindfulness of the body”, “the one with right recollection”, <span class="add">eight discourses are also to be recited for each of these as above</span>.</p>
<p><span class="add">Just as for </span>“the sense of eradicating <span class="add">[what is impermanent]</span>”, <span class="add">in the same way </span>“the sense of understanding <span class="add">[what is impermanent]</span>”, “the sense of extinguishing <span class="add">[what is impermanent]</span>”, “the sense of vomiting out <span class="add">[what is impermanent]</span>”, “the sense of ending <span class="add">[what is impermanent]</span>”, “the sense of relinquishing <span class="add">[what is impermanent]</span>” <span class="add">is also like this</span>.</p>
