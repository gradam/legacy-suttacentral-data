<h1>200. <span class="add">[Third Discourse to Rāhula]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the venerable Rāhula approached the Buddha, paid respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet, withdrew to sit to one side, and said to the Buddha:  </p>
<p>“It would be well if the Blessed One were to teach me the Dharma so that, on having heard the Dharma, I will in a quiet and secluded place engage in meditative contemplation and abide in diligence. Having in a quiet and secluded place engaged in meditative contemplation and abided in diligence, I will contemplate in such a way <span class="add">[as to realize]</span> that for whose sake clansmen shave their hair and beard, with right faith become homeless, go forth to train in the path, to practise and uphold the holy life. I here and now will realize and know by myself that: ‘Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done’, I myself know that there will be no receiving of any further existence.”  </p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, observing that Rāhula’s liberation of the mind and his wisdom were not yet mature, that he was not yet ready to receive the higher Dharma, asked Rāhula: “Have you taught the five aggregates of clinging to people?”  </p>
<p>Rāhula said to the Buddha: “Not yet, Blessed One.”  </p>
<p>The Buddha told Rāhula: “You should expound the five aggregates of clinging to people.”</p>
<p>Then, having received this instruction from the Buddha, on another occasion Rāhula expounded the five aggregates of clinging to people. Having taught them, he again approached the Buddha, paid respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet, withdrew to stand to one side, and said to the Buddha:</p>
<p>“Blessed One, I have taught the five aggregates of clinging to people. I would wish that the Blessed One teaches me the Dharma so that, on having heard the Dharma, I will in a quiet and secluded place engage in meditative contemplation and abide in diligence … <span class="add">up to</span> … knowing by myself that there will be no receiving of any further existence.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, again observing that Rāhula’s liberation of the mind and his knowledge were not yet mature, that he was not ready to receive the higher Dharma, asked Rāhula: “Have you taught the six sense-spheres to people?”</p>
<p>Rāhula said to the Buddha: “Not yet, Blessed One.”  </p>
<p>The Buddha told Rāhula: “You should expound the six sense-spheres to people.”</p>
<p>Then, on another occasion Rāhula expounded the six sense-spheres to people. Having taught the six sense-spheres, he approached the Buddha, paid respect with his head at <span class="add">[the Buddha’s feet]</span>, withdrew to stand to one side, and said to the Buddha:</p>
<p>“Blessed One, I have expounded the six sense-spheres to people. I would wish that the Blessed One teaches me the Dharma so that, on having heard the Dharma, I will in a quiet and secluded place engage in meditative contemplation and abide in diligence … <span class="add">up to</span> … knowing by myself that there will be no receiving of any further existence.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, <span class="add">[again]</span> observing that Rāhula’s liberation of the mind and his knowledge were not yet mature, that he was not ready to receive the higher Dharma, asked Rāhula: “Have you taught the principle of causality to people?”  </p>
<p>Rāhula said to the Buddha: “Not yet, Blessed One.”  </p>
<p>The Buddha told Rāhula: “You should expound the principle of causality to people.”</p>
<p>Then Rāhula, having on another occasion given widely teachings on the principle of causality to people, approached the Buddha, paid respect with his head at <span class="add">[the Buddha’s]</span> feet, withdrew to stand to one side, and said to the Buddha:  </p>
<p>“[May] the Blessed One teach me the Dharma so that, on having heard the Dharma, I will in a quiet and secluded place engage in meditative contemplation and abide in diligence … <span class="add">up to</span> … knowing by myself that there will be no receiving of any further existence.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, again observing that Rāhula’s liberation of the mind and his knowledge were not yet mature … <span class="add">to be spoken in full up to</span> … he told Rāhula: “You should in a quiet and secluded place engage in meditative contemplation and examine the meaning of those teachings you earlier taught.”</p>
<p>Then Rāhula, having received the Buddha’s instruction and orders, contemplated and pondered the teachings he earlier had heard and taught, examining their meaning. He thought: “All these teachings proceed towards Nirvāṇa, flow towards Nirvāṇa, ultimately establish <span class="add">[one]</span> in Nirvāṇa.”</p>
<p>Then Rāhula went to the Buddha, paid respect with his head at <span class="add">[the Buddha’s]</span> feet, withdrew to stand to one side, and said to the Buddha: “Blessed One, in a quiet and secluded place I contemplated and pondered the teachings I earlier had heard and taught, examining their meaning. I understood that all these teachings proceed towards Nirvāṇa, flow towards Nirvāṇa, and ultimately establish <span class="add">[one]</span> in Nirvāṇa.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, observing that Rāhula’s liberation of the mind and his knowledge were mature, that he was ready to receive the higher Dharma, told Rāhula: “Rāhula, everything is impermanent. What kind of things are impermanent? That is, the eye is impermanent, forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact …” <span class="add">as spoken above in detail on impermanence</span>.  </p>
<p>Then Rāhula, having heard what the Buddha said, was delighted, rejoiced, paid respect to the Buddha, and returned.</p>
<p>Then, having received the Buddha’s teaching, Rāhula engaged in meditative contemplation in a quiet and secluded place and abided in diligence. That for whose sake clansmen shave off their hair and beard, don the yellow robes, and out of right faith go forth into homelessness to train in the path, to practise the pure holy life … <span class="add">up to</span> … he here and now realized and knew by himself that: “Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of any further existence.” He had become an arahant whose mind was well liberated.</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said Rāhula was delighted and received it respectfully.  </p>
