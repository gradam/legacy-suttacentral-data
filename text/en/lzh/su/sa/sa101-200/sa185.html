<h1>185. <span class="add">[Discourse on Dispassion]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “It is just as if a person's turban is burning with fire, what could help him?”</p>
<p>The monks said to the Buddha: “Blessed One, he should arouse supreme desire, zeal, and energy at that time to help him to get it extinguished.”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to the monks: “Although one might still forget about one's turban burning, one should extinguish and eradicate the thriving fire of impermanence without remainder. For the sake of eradicating the fire of impermanence, one should cultivate a phrase of Dharma on the absence of lust. For the sake of eradicating what impermanent states should one cultivate a phrase of Dharma on the absence of lust? That is, one should, for the sake of eradicating impermanent bodily form, cultivate a phrase of Dharma on the absence of lust. For the sake of eradicating impermanent feeling … perception … formations … consciousness one should cultivate a phrase of Dharma on the absence of lust.”</p>
<p><i>In this way to be recited in full up to</i>: When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
<p><i>Just as </i>“what is impermanent”, <i>in the same way </i>“what is impermanent and of the past”, “what is impermanent and of the future”, “what is impermanent and of the present”, “what is impermanent and of the past and the future”, “what is impermanent and of the past and the present”, “what is impermanent and of the future and the present”, “what is impermanent and of the past, the future, and the present”, <i>[discourses] are also to be recited as above</i>.</p>
<p><i>Just as the eight discourses on </i>“one should cultivate a phrase of Dharma on the absence of lust”, <i>in the same way </i>“phrases that are right phrases and Dharma phrases on the absence of hatred” and “on the absence of delusion”, <i>eight discourses are also to be recited for each of these as above.</i></p>
<p><i>Just as the twenty-four discourses on </i>“one should eradicate”, <i>in the same way for </i>“one should understand”, “one should vomit out”, “one should extinguish”, “one should end”, “one should relinquish”, “one should make cease”, “one should make disappear”, <i>twenty-four discourses are also to be recited for each of these as above.</i></p>
