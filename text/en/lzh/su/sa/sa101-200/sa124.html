<h1>124. <span class="add">[Second Discourse on Māra]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Mount Makula with an attendant monk by the name of Rādha.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monk Rādha: “Monks, whatever bodily form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, it should all be contemplated as being completely <span class="add">[on the side of]</span> Māra. Whatever feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, it should all be contemplated as being completely <span class="add">[on the side of]</span> Māra.</p>
<p>“Rādha, what do you think, is bodily form permanent or is it impermanent?”</p>
<p>He replied: “It is impermanent, Blessed One.”</p>
<p>[The Buddha asked again]: “What is impermanent, is it <i>dukkha</i>?”</p>
<p>He replied: “It is <i>dukkha</i>, Blessed One.”</p>
<p>[The Buddha asked again]: “What is impermanent, <i>dukkha</i>, of a nature to change, would a learned noble disciple herein regard it as the self?”</p>
<p>He replied: “No, Blessed One.”</p>
<p>Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <span class="add">is also like this</span>.</p>
<p>“Therefore, Rādha, a learned noble disciple gives rise to disenchantment with bodily form, gives rise to disenchantment with feeling … perception … formations … consciousness. Because of being disenchanted, he does not delight in it. Because of not delighting in it, he becomes liberated. Being liberated he knows and sees: 'Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of any further existence.'”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monk Rādha was delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
