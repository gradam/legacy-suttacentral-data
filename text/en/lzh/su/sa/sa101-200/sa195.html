<h1>195. <span class="add">[First Discourse on Impermanence]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.  </p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “All is impermanent. What is all that is impermanent? That is, the eye is impermanent, forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact, and feeling arisen in dependence on eye-contact, be it painful feeling, pleasant feeling, or neutral feeling, that is also impermanent.  </p>
<p>“The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind <span class="add">is also like this.</span>  </p>
<p>“A learned noble disciple who contemplates like this gives rise to disenchantment for the eye, and gives rise to disenchantment for forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact, and feeling arisen in dependence on eye-contact, be it painful feeling, pleasant feeling, or neutral feeling.  </p>
<p>“He gives also rise to disenchantment for the ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind, and for sounds … odours … flavours … tangibles … mental objects … mind-consciousness, mind-contact, and feeling arisen in dependence on mind-contact, be it painful feeling, pleasant feeling, or neutral feeling.</p>
<p>“Because of being disenchanted, he does not delight in it. Because of not delighting in it, he is liberated. Being liberated, he knows and sees: ‘Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of any further existence.’”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.  </p>
<p><span class="add">As with the</span> discourse on being impermanent, <span class="add">in the same way also <span class="add">[discourses]</span> are to be recited in this way</span> <span class="add">for</span> being <i>dukkha</i>, empty, and not-self.</p>
