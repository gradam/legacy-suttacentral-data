<h1>196. <span class="add">[Second Discourse on Impermanence]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.  </p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “All is impermanent. What is all <span class="add">[that is impermanent]</span>? That is, the eye is impermanent, forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact, and feeling arisen in dependence on eye-contact, be it painful, pleasant, or neutral, that is also impermanent.  </p>
<p>“In the same way the ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind … mental objects … mind-consciousness, mind-contact, and feeling arisen in dependence on mind-contact, be it painful, pleasant, or neutral, that is also impermanent.</p>
<p>“A learned noble disciple who contemplates like this is liberated from the eye, and is also liberated from forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact, and feeling arisen in dependence on eye-contact, be it painful, pleasant, or neutral.  </p>
<p>“In the same way he is also liberated from the ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind … mental objects … mind-consciousness, mind-contact, and feeling arisen in dependence on mind-contact, be it painful, pleasant, or neutral.</p>
<p>“I say that he is liberated from birth, old age, disease, death, worry, sorrow, vexation, and pain.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.  </p>
<p><span class="add">As has been said for</span> all is impermanent, <span class="add">in the same way for</span> all is <i>dukkha</i> … all is empty … all is not-self … all is of the nature of void activity … all is subject to destruction … all is subject to birth … all is subject to old age … all is subject to disease … all is subject to death … all is subject to worry … all is subject to affliction … all is subject to arising … all is subject to cessation … all is of the nature to be understood … all is of the nature to be known … all is of the nature to be abandoned … all is of the nature to be awakened to … all is to be realized … all is <span class="add">[the domain]</span> of Māra … all is within Māra’s power … all is Māra’s tool … all is burning … all is ablaze … all is on fire, <span class="add">for all of these, each discourse is to be recited in full as above</span>.</p>
