<h1>127. <span class="add">[First Discourse on Being of the Nature to be Abandoned]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Mount Makula, at that time being with an attendant monk by the name of Rādha.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One said to Rādha: “Whatever bodily form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, it should all be contemplated as being completely of the nature to be abandoned. Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <span class="add">is also like this</span>.</p>
<p>“A learned noble disciple who contemplates in this way gives rise to disenchantment with bodily form, gives rise to disenchantment with feeling … perception … formations … consciousness. Because of being disenchanted, he does not delight in it. Because of not delighting in it, he becomes liberated. Being liberated he himself knows and sees: 'Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of any further existence.'”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monk Rādha was delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
<p>Just as “examining it as being of the nature to be abandoned”, in the same way one “examines it as being of the nature to cease”, “examines it as being of the nature to be given up”, “examines it as being of an impermanent nature”, “examines it as being of the nature of being <i>dukkha</i>“, “examines it as being of an empty nature”, “examines it as being of a not-self nature”, “examines it as being of the nature of being impermanent, <i>dukkha</i>, empty, and not self”, “examines it as being of the nature of a disease”, “examines it as being of the nature of a carbuncle”, “examines it as being of the nature of a thorn”, “examines it as being of the nature of being cut off”, “examines it as being of the nature of <span class="add">[providing]</span> the foundation for being cut off”, “examines it as being of the nature of a disease, a carbuncle, a thorn, being cut off, and the foundation for being cut off.” In this way the discourses <span class="add">are all as said above</span>.</p>
