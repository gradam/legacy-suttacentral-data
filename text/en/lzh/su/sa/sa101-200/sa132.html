<h1>132. <span class="supplied">[Discourse on Not Becoming Habituated]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “If a recluse or Brahmin does not become habituated to bodily form, then he does not follow Māra's power, does not go into Māra's hand, does not follow Māra's wishes, is not bound by Māra's bondage, and is free from Māra's fetters. Not becoming habituated to feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <i>is also like this</i>.</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
<p><i>Up to </i>“vomiting out bodily form” <i>is also like this.</i></p>
