<h1>134. <span class="supplied">[First Discourse on Abandoning Doubt]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks … <i>as said above, with the difference</i>: “A learned noble disciple examines these six standpoints for views as not self and not belonging to a self. One who contemplates in this way abandons doubt in relation to <i>dukkha</i>, in relation to its arising, in relation to its cessation, and in relation to the path.</p>
<p>Monks, this is called a learned noble disciple who is no longer capable of undertaking a bodily, verbal or mental deed that leads to the three evil destinies, … <i>to be spoken in full up to </i>… makes an end of <i>dukkha</i>.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
