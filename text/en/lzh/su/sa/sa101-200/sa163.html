<h1>163. <span class="add">[Discourse on the View on Fourteen Hundred Thousand]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “The existence of what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached to what, by seeing what as the self, do living beings have a view like this and speak like this:30 'In this there are fourteen hundred thousand gates to birth <span class="add">[as well as]</span> sixty thousand and six hundred <span class="add">[gates to birth]</span>, five actions, three actions, two actions, one action, and half an action, sixty-two pathways, sixty-two minor aeons, one hundred and twenty hells, one hundred and thirty faculties,31 thirty-six elements of lust, forty-nine thousand abodes of dragons (<i>nāga</i> s), forty-nine thousand abodes of heavenly birds (<i>garuḍa</i> ), forty-nine thousand forms of wrong livelihood for heterodox practitioners, forty-nine thousand forms of going forth for heterodox practitioners, seven percipient aeons, seven non-percipient aeons, seven <span class="add">[kinds of]</span> demons (<i>asura</i> ), seven <span class="add">[kinds of]</span> goblins (<i>pisāca</i> ), seven <span class="add">[kinds of]</span> <i>deva</i> s, seven <span class="add">[kinds of]</span> humans, seven hundred <span class="add">[kinds of]</span> humans, seven <span class="add">[kinds of]</span> dreams, seven hundred <span class="add">[kinds of dreams]</span>, seven <span class="add">[kinds of]</span> dangers, seven hundred <span class="add">[kinds of]</span> dangers, seven <span class="add">[kinds of]</span> thoughts, seven hundred <span class="add">[kinds of]</span> thoughts, six <span class="add">[kinds of]</span> births, ten <span class="add">[kinds of]</span> progress, and eight stages of a great man.</p>
<p>“In this there are eighty-four thousand great aeons, which fools as well as the wise come and go through until the complete ending of <i>dukkha. </i> There is no recluse or brahmin who could proclaim this: 'By constantly upholding morality and undergoing austerities, cultivating the holy life, I will make unripe action ripen, and abandon already ripe action.'</p>
<p>“Advancing and retreating <span class="add">[on the path of purification]</span> cannot be known. One constantly lives with this pain and pleasure, being born and passing away for a fixed amount <span class="add">[of times]</span>. It is just as if a ball of thread is hurled into space and gradually comes down until it stays by itself on the ground. The fixed amount <span class="add">[of times]</span> of one's being born and passing away in these eighty-four thousand great aeons is just like that?'”</p>
<p>The monks said to the Buddha: “The Blessed One is the root of the Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma …” <span class="add">to be recited fully in the same way in the sequence of the above three discourses</span>.</p>
