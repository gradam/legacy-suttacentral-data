<h1>163. <span class="supplied">[Discourse on the View on Fourteen Hundred Thousand]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “The existence of what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached to what, by seeing what as the self, do living beings have a view like this and speak like this:30 'In this there are fourteen hundred thousand gates to birth [as well as] sixty thousand and six hundred [gates to birth], five actions, three actions, two actions, one action, and half an action, sixty-two pathways, sixty-two minor aeons, one hundred and twenty hells, one hundred and thirty faculties,31 thirty-six elements of lust, forty-nine thousand abodes of dragons (<i>nāga</i>s), forty-nine thousand abodes of heavenly birds (<i>garu</i><i>ḍ</i><i>a</i>), forty-nine thousand forms of wrong livelihood for heterodox practitioners, forty-nine thousand forms of going forth for heterodox practitioners, seven percipient aeons, seven non-percipient aeons, seven [kinds of] demons (<i>asura</i>), seven [kinds of] goblins (<i>pisāca</i>), seven [kinds of] <i>deva</i>s, seven [kinds of] humans, seven hundred [kinds of] humans, seven [kinds of] dreams, seven hundred [kinds of dreams], seven [kinds of] dangers, seven hundred [kinds of] dangers, seven [kinds of] thoughts, seven hundred [kinds of] thoughts, six [kinds of] births, ten [kinds of] progress, and eight stages of a great man.</p>
<p>“In this there are eighty-four thousand great aeons, which fools as well as the wise come and go through until the complete ending of <i>dukkha. </i>There is no recluse or brahmin who could proclaim this: 'By constantly upholding morality and undergoing austerities, cultivating the holy life, I will make unripe action ripen, and abandon already ripe action.'</p>
<p>“Advancing and retreating [on the path of purification] cannot be known. One constantly lives with this pain and pleasure, being born and passing away for a fixed amount [of times]. It is just as if a ball of thread is hurled into space and gradually comes down until it stays by itself on the ground. The fixed amount [of times] of one's being born and passing away in these eighty-four thousand great aeons is just like that?'”</p>
<p>The monks said to the Buddha: “The Blessed One is the root of the Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma …” <i>to be recited fully in the same way in the sequence of the above three discourses</i>.</p>
