<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the Blessed One said to the monks:</p>
<p>“Bodily form is impermanent, what is impermanent is <i>dukkha</i>, what is <i>dukkha</i> is not-self, what is not self is not mine. One who contemplates like this is reckoned to be contemplating truly and rightly. <em>In the same way</em> feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is impermanent, what is impermanent is <i>dukkha</i>, what is <i>dukkha</i> is not-self, what is not self is not mine. One who contemplates like this is reckoned to be contemplating truly and rightly.</p>
<p>“A noble disciple who contemplates like this becomes liberated from bodily form, liberated from feeling … perception … formations … consciousness. I say such a one is liberated from birth, old age, disease, death, worry, sorrow, pain and vexation.”</p>
<p>Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
