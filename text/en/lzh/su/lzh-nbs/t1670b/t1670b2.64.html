<h1>2.64. An Arhat’s Ability to Travel</h1>
</div>
<p>The king asked Nāgasena again, “How far is it from here to the seventh heaven of Brahman?”</p>
<p>Nāgasena said, “It is very far. Suppose a rock as large as the palace of the king were to fall from the seventh heaven of Brahman, it would take six months to reach the earth.”</p>
<p>“Your sramanas say that a person who has attained arhathood flies to the seventh heaven of Brahman as quickly as one could extend forth his bent arm or have it bend back again. These words I could not believe. How could he go thousands and thousands of li so fast.”</p>
<p>Nāgasena asked the king: “Great king, in which country were you born?”</p>
<p>“I was born in the kingdom of Yonaka, in a country named Alasanda.”</p>
<p>“How many li is it from here to Alasanda?”</p>
<p>“It is about two thousand yojana, equal to eight thousand li.”</p>
<p>“Do you think of your country which is far away from here?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I always think of things in my country.”</p>
<p>“Great king, try to recollect any business you once did in your country … have you done so?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have done so.”</p>
<p>“So quick it is, great king, that you have gone and returned a distance of about eighty thousand li.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
