<h1><span class="add">Sense-pleasures, Forms, Feelings &amp; Perception</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then, in time, many many monks put on their <span class="add">outer</span> robes and took up alms-bowls <span class="add">in order to</span> enter the city to beg for alms-food. </p>
<p>Now the following occurred to that group of monks, “Now all of us could go to the whereabouts of the adherents of other teachings and brahmin <span class="add">ascetics</span>”. </p>
<p>So all of them went to the place where <span class="add">the followers</span> of other teachings and brahmin <span class="add">ascetics</span> were. Having arrived, they exchanged friendly greetings <span class="add">with them</span> and sat down to one side. </p>
<p>The brahmin <span class="add">ascestics</span> asked the <span class="add">Buddhist</span> Śramaṇas, “The hermit Gautama always deals with sense-pleasures, forms, feelings and perception. How does he differ <span class="add">from us</span> when he deals with these <span class="add">topics</span>? What we deal with likewise is what the ascetic <span class="add">Gautama</span> treats, and what he treats is likewise what we deal with. The teaching he sets forth and the teaching we set forth is identical; his instructions and our instructions are the same.” </p>
<p>When that group of monks had heard this statement, they rose from their seats and left together without any good or bad words, thinking, “We should go to the Exalted One and ask him about the meaning of this.”</p>
<p>After their <span class="add">alms-round and</span> meal, that group of monks went to the place where the Exalted One was. On their arrival they bowed down their heads at his feet and sat down at one sideṭhey told the Exalted One what they had been asked by the brahmin <span class="add">ascetics whose statement</span> occasioned the monks’ uncertainty.</p>
<p>“When you are asked this questions by <span class="add">adherents of</span> other <span class="add">teachings and</span> brahmin <span class="add">ascetics</span>,” the Exalted One said to the monks, “You should reply to them with a <span class="add">counter-</span>question, ‘As for sense-pleasures, what is enjoying them like and what is their wretchedness <span class="add">because of which</span> they should be given up? As for forms, … as for feelings, what is enjoying them like and what is their wretchedness <span class="add">because of which desire for them</span> should be given up?’ </p>
<p>“When you reply to the brahmin <span class="add">ascetics</span> with a <span class="add">counter-</span>question thus formulated, they will fall silent and make no reply <span class="add">on their part</span>. However, should there be someone who as something to say, he will be unable to explain this <span class="add">matter</span> in a profound way. <span class="add">The followers of other teachings</span> will be all the more confused and at their <span class="add">wits’</span> end, for this is not their field. </p>
<p>“To be sure, O monks, I tell <span class="add">you that</span> there is nobody <span class="add">in the world with its</span> Māra, Māra gods, Śakra and Brahmā, the four World-Guardians, <span class="add">with its</span> Śramaṇas and brahmins, human and non-human beings who could explain this <span class="add">matter</span> in a profound way except <a class="t" id="t605a"></a> the Tathāgata, the Fully Enlightened One, <span class="add">anyone among</span> the many noble <span class="add">disciples</span> of the Tathāgata <span class="add">or</span> anybody who has received my teaching.</p>
<p>“As for sense pleasures, what is enjoying them like? There are the so-called five sense-pleasures. Which are the five? When the eye sees forms, eye-consciousness is caused to arise <span class="add">followed by</span> excessive fondness <span class="add">for forms</span>, ever-present in mankind <span class="add">and giving it</span> complete satisfaction. When the ear hears sounds, the nose smells scents, the tongue recognises flavours and when tangibles are felt with the body <span class="add">the respective kinds of consciousness are</span> caused to arise <span class="add">followed by</span> excessive fondness <span class="add">for the respective sense-objects</span>, ever-present in mankind <span class="add">and giving it</span> complete satisfaction. Now when on account of these five sense-pleasures <span class="add">one’s</span> mind experiences pleasures and pain, this is called enjoyment of sense-pleasures.</p>
<p>“As for sense-pleasures, what is their wretchedness? Now there is a son of a good family who, for his livelihood, trains to become proficient in many a field: either farming or writing or <span class="add">public</span> service or calculating or pretension to empowerment or courier service or royal service. He does not avoid <span class="add">exposing</span> his body to heat and cold, <span class="add">and in his</span> training he works hard and zealously, <span class="add">taking great</span> pains and without sparing himself. Becoming rich and making a fortune by taking so much trouble—that is great wretchedness for the sake of sense-pleasures. In this world all suffering is due to attachment to and desire for them.</p>
<p>“<span class="add">If,</span> however, that son of good family works so hard but does not gain any wealth, he worries too much and his suffering is indescribable. <span class="add">In this situation</span> he thinks to himself, ‘I have applied all methods and carried out all plans, and yet I earn no money, one should think of giving up.’ This points to the desirability of giving up sense-pleasures.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, while carrying out his plans, that son of good family may earn money; and with that earned money he may, in an intelligent manner, undertake a big project. Continually he his on his guard for fear that the king may order <span class="add">his property</span> to be confiscated, that thieves might secretly steal it, water might sweep it away <span class="add">or</span> that fire might consume it. It, moreover, occurs to him, ‘<span class="add">If I</span> try circumspectly to hide <span class="add">my money</span> in a <span class="add">secret</span> storeroom, <span class="add">I will</span> be apprehensive about its future loss. <span class="add">If I</span> want to invest <span class="add">my money in teh hope of making</span> a profit, <span class="add">I will</span> be apprehensive about the risks; or a wicked son will grow up in my family and <span class="add">eventually</span> squander my property.’ On account of <span class="add">all</span> this, sense-pleasures <span class="add">taken to require possessions as a prerequisite</span> create sheer distress. All this <span class="add">suffering</span> is due to and has its roots in sense-pleasures which cause this havoc.</p>
<p>“Now although that son of good family always concerns himself with safeguarding his money, after some time it is confiscated by the king, thieves rob him of it, it is swept away by water, it is consumed by fire, it is hidden in a storeroom and thereafter its <span class="add">whereabouts</span> is uncertain, it is made good use of <span class="add">by way of</span> investment <span class="add">for the sake of high</span> returns, <span class="add">or</span> a wicked son growing up in his house <span class="add">eventually</span> squanders his money<span class="add">so that</span> of a considerable fortune not even a fraction is left. Consequently he worries too much and suffers, beating his breast and wailing, ‘The money I had earned before has gone now, it is lost!’ Accordingly, he is thrown into confusion and becomes mentally deranged. This the meaning of sense-pleasures create sheer distress. <span class="add">All</span> this <span class="add">suffering</span> is due to and has its roots in sense-pleasures so that one does not attain the Unconditioned.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, due to sense-pleasures and being rooted in them, <span class="add">adversaries</span> put on armour and attack each other. In doing so, they face units of <span class="add">war</span> elephants, of cavalry, infantry or war chariots. On seeing the elephants, cavalry, war chariots or infantry they charge at them. They put each other to the sword or shoot each other dead; with lances and battle axes they cause blood and gore. As sense-pleasures are related to this, they create sheer distress which is due to and has its roots in them, causing this havoc. Moreover, due to sense-pleasures and being rooted in them, <span class="add">adversaries</span> launch fierce attacks either on city gates or on its ramparts, putting each other to the sword, shooting each other dead, piercing each other with their lances, knocking down <span class="add">and cutting off</span> each other’s heads with iron discs or killing each other with molten iron. <span class="add">As a result of all this,</span> they suffer too much and die in huge numbers. Accordingly, those who enjoy sense-pleasures are subject to impermanence. Everybody <span class="add">one day</span> meets his end, <span class="add">being subject to</span> transformation <span class="add">from youth to old age to death</span> without there being any <span class="add">real</span> standstill. Being in the grip of sense-pleasures and <span class="add">therefore</span> subject to impermanence and re-birth, this is what is called sense-pleasures creating sheer distress.</p>
<p>“How should one give up sense-pleasures? When someone succeeds in practising the overcoming of sensuous greed, this is called their renunciation. The so-called Śramaṇas and brahmin <span class="add">ascetics</span> who do not know of sense-pleasures as entailing sheer distress, also do not know where to begin <span class="add">in order to</span> give them up. Those Śramaṇas and brahmin <span class="add">ascetics</span> do not really know of the deportment pertaining to them; they are not <span class="add">real</span> Śramaṇas and brahmin <span class="add">ascetics</span> and are unable to give rise to their realising <span class="add">the ultimate goal</span> and perfect mastery over themselves. The Śramaṇas and brahmin <span class="add">ascetics</span> who perfectly know of sense-pleasures as entailing sheer distress, are capable of really and unpretentiously giving them up. They know of the deportment pertaining to Śramaṇas and brahmin <span class="add">ascetics</span>. They have give <span class="add">rise</span> to their realising <span class="add">the ultimate goal</span> and perfect mastery over themselves. This is what is meant by giving up sense pleasures.”</p>
<p>“What is the enjoyment of forms? Let us suppose <span class="add">someone</span> sees a girl either of noble descent, of brahminic descent or of a householder’s family, fourteen, fifteen or sixteen years old, neither tall nor short, neither plump nor thin, neither <span class="add">too</span> fair not <span class="add">too</span> dark, being respectable and of incomparable <span class="add">beauty</span> seldom to be found in the world. hardly has one seen her complexion when one experiences pleasure and joy—this is called enjoyment of forms.</p>
<p>“How do forms create sheer distress? If one sees that ‘girl’ again after <span class="add">a time</span>, being eighty, ninety or even a hundred years of age, her complexion has totally changed; with the passage of time her vigour is gone, her teeth are broken and her hair is as white as snow; her body is blotchy, the skin is flaccid, the face all wrinkles, the spine deformed, the body <span class="add">resembling</span> a creaking and groaning old cart; <span class="add">with</span> shaking frame she stumbles along, leaning on a stick. What do you think, monks? <span class="add">The girl endowed with</span> such pleasing appearance before and afterwards having totally changed, is that not sheer distress?” </p>
<p>“It is, Exalted One,” replied the monks.</p>
<p>“That is how forms create sheer distress,” the Exalted One <span class="add">went on</span> saying to the monks.</p>
<p>“Moreover, if one sees that woman with her body exposed to great affliction, being confined to bed, incontinent and unable to rise and stand, what do you think, monks? <span class="add">The girl</span> originally <span class="add">being endowed with</span> such a pleasing appearance and now exposed to this affliction, is that not sheer distress?”</p>
<p>“It is, Exalted One,” replied the monks.</p>
<p>“That is how forms create sheer distress,” the Exalted One <span class="add">went on</span> saying to the monks.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, monks, if one sees that woman’s body, broken up, lifeless, and on its way to the cemetery—how is that, monks? Formerly beholding that pleasing form and now—what a transformation! When in this <span class="add">situation one’s</span> mind experiences pleasure and pain welling up, is that not sheer distress?”</p>
<p>“It is, Exalted One,” replied the monks … </p>
<p>“And again, if one sees that woman in one place being dead for one day, two, three, four, five, up to seven days, her body being bloated, putrid, nauseating and decomposing—how is that, bhikkus? That originally pleasing form which has now undergone this transformation, is that not sheer distress?”</p>
<p>“It is, Exalted One,” replied the monks … </p>
<p>“In addition, if one sees crows and magpies, kites and vultures come squabbling over that woman prey, or <span class="add">if</span> one sees her being devoured by foxes, dogs, wolves <span class="add">or</span> tigers or being <span class="add">infested and</span> fed on by mosquio larvae rapidly worming <span class="add">their way into flesh, and by other</span> extremely small wriggling worms—how is that monks? Originally she was endowed with such a pleasing appearance, and now she has undergone this transformation! When in this <span class="add">situation one’s</span> mind experiences extreme pleasure and pain welling up, is that not sheer distress?”</p>
<p>“It is, Exalted One,” replied the monks … </p>
<p>“Additionally, if one sees that woman’s body half eaten away by birds <span class="add">of prey</span> and worms, <span class="add">with its</span> bowels, stomach, bloody flesh <span class="add">and various kinds of</span> impure substances <span class="add">exposed</span> … That is how forms create sheer distress,” the Exalted One <span class="add">went on</span> saying to the monks. </p>
<p>“Furthermore, if one sees that woman’s body without flesh and blood, the bar skeleton with its bones <span class="add">still</span> joined together … That is how forms create sheer distress … if one sees that woman’s body without flesh and blood and only <span class="add">with dry bones</span> held together by tendons <span class="add">like</span> a bundle of firewood … That is how forms create sheer distress … if one sees <span class="add">the remains</span> of that woman’s body, disconnected bones scattered in different places—here a bone of the foot, there a humerus, here another bone, there <a class="t" id="t606a"></a> a hip bone, ribs, a shoulder blade, vertebrae of the neck and the skull … That is how forms create sheer distress … if one sees the shining white or dove-grey bones of that woman’s body … That is how forms create sheer distress … if one sees the dry bones of that woman, after countless years putrid, rotten and <span class="add">finally</span> indistinguishable from earth … That is how forms create sheer distress.</p>
<p>“Moreover, these forms are impermanent, <span class="add">subject to</span> change and ephemeral; there is nothing that remains young. That is how forms create sheer distress.</p>
<p>“How should one escape from forms? When someone succeeds in giving up and getting rid of all stupefaction with regard to forms, this is called giving up with regard to forms. </p>
<p>“As for forms, the so-called Śramaṇas and brahmin <span class="add">ascetics</span> cling to them; they do not know of <span class="add">their entailing</span> sheer distress, and they do not overcome <span class="add">clinging</span> because they do not know <span class="add">forms</span> in accordance with fact. They are not real Śramaṇas and brahmin <span class="add">ascetics and</span> do not <span class="add">really</span> know <span class="add">how</span> to overcome <span class="add">all attachment</span>. That is what is called with Śramaṇas and brahmin <span class="add">ascetics their</span> knowing of the deportment pertaining to them; by themselves they realise <span class="add">the ultimate goal</span> and perfect mastery over themselves. This is what is meant by giving up <span class="add">stupefaction</span> with regard to forms.</p>
<p>“What is that which <span class="add">has been</span> referred to as enjoyment of feelings? When there is a monk experiencing a pleasant feeling, he knows, ‘I am experiencing a pleasant feeling.’ When experiencing a painful feeling, he knows, ‘I am experiencing a painful feeling.’ When experiencing a neither painful nor pleasant feeling, he knows, ‘I am experiencing neither a painful nor pleasant feeling.’ When experiencing a pleasant sensual feeling, he knows, ‘I am experiencing a pleasant sensual feeling.’ When a experiencing a painful sensual feeling, he knows, ‘I am experiencing a painful sensual feeling.’ When experiencing a neither painful nor pleasant sensual feeling, he knows, ‘I am experiencing neither a painful nor pleasant sensual feeling.’ <span class="add">When experiencing</span> a painful spiritual feeling, he knows, ‘I am experiencing a painful spiritual feeling.’ <span class="add">When experiencing</span> a pleasant spiritual feeling, he knows, ‘I am experiencing a painful spiritual feeling.’ When <span class="add">experiencing</span> a neither painful nor pleasant feeling, he knows, ‘I am experiencing neither a painful nor pleasant spiritual feeling.’</p>
<p>“Moreover, when the monk is experiencing a pleasant feeling, he does not experience a painful feeling; and neither does he experience a neutral feeling; at that time he <span class="add">knows ‘I am</span> just experiencing a pleasant feeling.’ When he is experiencing a painful feeling, he does not experience a pleasant feeling and neither does he experience a neutral feeling, <span class="add">he knows, I am</span> just experiencing a painful feeling. When the monk is experiencing a neutral feeling, he does not experience either a pleasant or a painful feeling <span class="add">and thus knows, ‘I am</span> just experiencing a neutral feeling.’ Again, feelings are indeed impermanent and subject to change. So considering the impermanence of the feelings certainly being subject to change—that is how feelings create sheer distress.</p>
<p>“How should one escape from feelings? When someone succeeds in giving up and getting rid of all stupefaction with regard to feelings, this is called giving up with regard to feelings. As for feelings, those Śramaṇas and brahmin <span class="add">ascetics</span> who cling to them, do not know of <span class="add">their entailing</span> sheer distress, and they do not overcome <span class="add">clinging</span> because they do not know <span class="add">feelings</span> in accordance with fact. They are not <span class="add">real</span> Śramaṇas and brahmin <span class="add">ascetics and</span> do not really know of the deportment pertaining to them, being unable to personally realise <span class="add">the ultimate goal</span> and perfect mastery over themselves. The Śramaṇas and brahmin <span class="add">ascetics</span> who, as for feelings, do not cling to them, profoundly knowing of <span class="add">their entailing</span> sheer distress, certainly know <span class="add">how</span> to overcome <span class="add">all attachment</span>. That is what is called with Śramaṇas and brahmin <span class="add">ascetics their</span> knowing of the deportment pertaining to them; personally they realise <span class="add">the ultimate goal</span> and perfect mastery over themselves. This is what is meant by giving up <span class="add">stupefaction</span> with regard to feelings.</p>
<p>“In addition, monks, if a Śramaṇa or brahmin <span class="add">ascetic</span> does not discern painful, pleasant or neutral feelings and does not know <span class="add">them</span> in accordance with fact, but if they teach <span class="add">other</span> persons, such action is improper. If a Śramaṇa or brahmin <span class="add">ascetic</span> succeeds in giving up <span class="add">clinging to</span> feelings <span class="add">by dint of</span> knowing them in accordance with fact and if he inspires <span class="add">other</span> persons through his teachings to become detached from them <span class="add">too</span>, this is correct and proper. This is what is meant by giving up <span class="add">stupefaction</span> with regard to feelings.</p>
<p>“Now monks, I have availed myself of <span class="add">the occasion</span> to speak about sense-pleasures, one’s clinging to and enjoying them, about their creating sheer distress and about those who succeed in giving them up. I have spoken likewise about forms, one’s clinging to and enjoying them, about their creating sheer distress and about <span class="add">those who</span> succeed in getting rid of all <span class="add">stupefaction</span> with regard to forms; <span class="add">I have </span> availed myself of <span class="add">the occasion</span> to speak about feelings, one’s clinging … to them, … succeed in giving up <span class="add">clinging to</span> them. As to what behoves all Tathāgatas to do, viz. to teach, I have discharged <span class="add">my duty</span> now. Always practise mindfulness; meditate under trees; wisely reflect in empty spaces, do not be negligent. That is what <span class="add">would like to</span> bring home <span class="add">to you</span>.” </p>
<p>Having listened to the Exalted One’s words, the monks were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
