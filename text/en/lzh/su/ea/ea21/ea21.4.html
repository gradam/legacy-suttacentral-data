<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then the Exalted One said to the monks:</p>
<p>“If there are persons <span class="add">towards whom you</span> cultivate friendliness in your hearts, <span class="add">who</span> think <span class="add">they can</span> really trust <span class="add">in you</span> and who listen <span class="add">to you</span> respectfully, <span class="add">viz.</span> father and mother, brothers, <span class="add">sisters, other</span> family members, relatives, friends or intimates, <span class="add">you should</span> establish <span class="add">them</span> in three bases <span class="add">on which they should take their stand</span> unwavering. Which are the three? </p>
<p>“They should be encouraged unwaveringly to take delight in the Tathāgata <span class="add">thus</span>: He is the Tathāgata who has realised absolute truth, Fully and Completely Enlightened One, perfect in knowledge and conduct, the Blessed One, Knower of the Universe, the Incomparable One, the Teaching Guide <span class="add">to show sentient beings</span> the Way, the Teacher of Gods and Men, the Buddha, the Exalted One.</p>
<p>“Again, they should be encouraged to direct their attention to the Teaching <span class="add">thus</span>: the Tathāgata’s Dharma is well-proclaimed, inviting, in the highest degree making for exquisiteness, yielding immediate results and thus to be understood by the wise.</p>
<p>“Similarly, they should be encouraged to contemplate and honour this Order of Disciples, the Tathāgata’s Śrāvakasaṃgha, <span class="add">thus</span>: <span class="add">Among them</span> prevails absolute concord, they walk in the right path, are endowed with all virtues and have achieved perfection in moral training, concentration and wisdom, in <span class="add">ultimate</span> freedom and insight-knowledge of this freedom, that is to say the Order of Disciples, the four pairs <span class="add">of noble persons</span> and the eight <span class="add">kinds of āryas</span>. This is the Tathāgata’s Śrāvakasaṃgha, worthy of respect and worthy of veneration, this is the world’s incomparable field of merit. </p>
<p>“Whoever, monks, trains in these three bases will achieve great results. Thus monks, you should train.” </p>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the monks were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
