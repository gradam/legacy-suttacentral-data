<h1><span class="supplied">Security</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then the Exalted One said to the monks:</p>
<p>“There are three things that are inevitably insecure. Which three? Inevitably insecure are a) one’s body, b) one’s life and c) one’s property. These, monks, are the three <span class="supplied">things</span> that are inevitably insecure. </p>
<p>“Now, monks, in regard to the three <span class="supplied">things</span> being inevitably insecure, one should search for <span class="supplied">three kind of</span> skilful means so as to realise three <span class="supplied">kinds of</span> complete security. Which are the three? <span class="supplied">There are the skilful means of someone</span> in quest of complete security <span class="supplied">in regard to</span> a) one’s body, b) life and c) property that are inevitably insecure. </p>
<p>“And what is <span class="supplied">the skilful means of someone</span> in quest of complete security a) <span class="supplied">in regard to</span> one’s body that is inevitably insecure? It is reverence, worship and, in due time, enquiring into <span class="supplied">the Dharma</span>. This is <span class="supplied">the skilful means of someone</span> in quest of complete security <span class="supplied">in regard to</span> one’s body … </p>
<p>“What is <span class="supplied">the skilful means of someone</span> in quest of complete security <span class="supplied">in regard to</span> b) one’s life that is inevitably insecure? As for <span class="supplied">this</span>, when a son or daughter of good family, as long as life lasts, does not kill any living being, does not brandish either a sword or a cudgel, being always guided by modesty and with a heart <span class="supplied">full of</span> friendliness and compassion encompassing all living beings; when, as long as life lasts, <span class="supplied">he or she</span> does not steal, is always intent upon generosity and with a heart unstained by stinginess, when, as long as life lasts, <span class="supplied">he or she</span> is neither licentious nor <span class="supplied">induces</span> others to be so; as long as life lasts, does not tell lies being always intent upon absolute honesty and without cheating anybody in the world; … and does not drink alcohol, <span class="supplied">thereby</span> avoiding getting befuddled and <span class="supplied">thus being able</span> to maintain observance of the Buddha’s moral training. This is <span class="supplied">the skilful means of someone</span> in quest of security <span class="supplied">in regard to</span> one’s life … </p>
<p>“What is <span class="supplied">the skilful means of someone</span> in quest of complete security <span class="supplied">in regard to</span> c) one’s property that is inevitably insecure? As for <span class="supplied">this</span>, when a son or daughter of good family, as long as life lasts, is always intent upon generosity towards Śramaṇas, brahmin <span class="supplied">ascetics</span> and all those living in poverty, giving food to those who require it, providing broth to those who need it, <span class="supplied">providing</span> robes, food, lodging, medicine for treating the sick, accommodation and a place to live <span class="supplied">either in</span> a city <span class="supplied">or in</span> a suburb; <span class="supplied">when he or she, as long as life lasts,</span> supplies indeed everything that is needed. Suchlike is <span class="supplied">the skilful means of someone</span> in quest of complete security <span class="supplied">in regard to</span> one’s property that is inevitably insecure. It is, monks, by dint of these <span class="supplied">three kinds of skilful means</span> that one aspires to the three <span class="supplied">kinds of</span> complete security <span class="supplied">in regard to</span> the three <span class="supplied">kinds of</span> inevitable insecurity just mentioned.” </p>
<p>Then the exalted One uttered the following verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Knowing that one’s body is inevitably insecure and that,<br>
Of course, the same holds true of one’s life, and that<br>
One’s property is subject to loss, one should aspire<br>
To complete security. It is extremely difficult to obtain a<br>
Human body; before long one’s life comes to an<br>
End and the fate of one’s property will be destruction.<br>
<span class="supplied">So</span> one <span class="supplied">should</span> happily be intent upon generosity.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the monks were pleasaed and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
