<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then the Exalted One said to the monks: </p>
<p>“There are these two modes of behaviour that cause a man to be born in a low and poor family. Which are the two? Being without filial piety towards one’s father and mother and without obedience towards one’s honourable teachers: and also personally being unable to perform duties. These are, monks, the two modes of behaviour that cause a man to be born in a low and poor family. </p>
<p>“Furthermore, monks, there are two modes of behaviour, <span class="add">leading to one’s</span> being born in an outstanding and powerful family. Which are the two? Honouring one’s father and mother, one’s brothers, sisters and other relatives; being ready to show one’s family as much generosity as possible. These are, monks, the two modes of behaviour <span class="add">leading to one’s</span> being born in an outstanding an powerful family. Thus, O monks, one should actually train.” </p>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the monks were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
