<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove. Then the Exalted One said to the monks:</p>
<p>“In the world there are these two living beings who are not frightened when becoming aware of lightning and thunder. Which are the two? These two living beings, O monks, who are found in the world and who do not experience fright on becoming aware of lightning and thunder are the lion, king of the beasts and also the <i>arhat</i> for whom malign influences have come to an end.</p>
<p>“Therefore, O monks, one should train to become an <i>arhat</i> in whom malign influences have come to an end. Thus O monks, one should actually train.”</p>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the monks were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
