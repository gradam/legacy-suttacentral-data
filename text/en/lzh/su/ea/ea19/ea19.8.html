<h1><span class="add">The Brahmin Lady Sūṣas</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī … Then a brahmin lady by the name of Sūṣas approached Venerable Mahā-Kauṣṭhila. On her arrival, she bowed down her head <span class="add">at the venerable one’s</span> feet and sat down at one side. Then Sūṣas, that brahmin lady, said to Kauṣṭhila: </p>
<p>“Both Udraka Rāmaputra and Arāḍa Kālāma died without their family having been converted to the profundity of this Teaching <span class="add">of the Buddha</span>. The Exalted One describes these two persons as having realised respectively the spheres of ‘nothingness’ and of ‘neither-perception-nor-non-perception’. When the lifetime of both had come to an end, after their death, one of them was destined for kingship on the periphery <span class="add">of the civilised world, and his rule</span> proved a great distress to countless human beings. The other person’s lot was to be a rapacious winged fox that was trapped <span class="add">in its existence</span> as a flying and running beast. When <span class="add">these two kinds of existence</span> had come to an end, both of them went to the Avīci hell. Nevertheless the Exalted One did not say when their share off agony would be used up. Why did he not do so?”</p>
<p>“The Exalted One kept silent,” Venerable Kauṣṭhila replied to Lady Sūṣas, “because nobody asked such a question. So the Exalted One did not say anything as to when the amount of extreme suffering would be finished.”</p>
<p>“As for the Tathāgata”, Lady Sūṣas continued, “he has entered <span class="add">Pari</span>nirvāṇa so that it is no longer possible to ask <span class="add">him</span> that <span class="add">question</span>. Having to stay on in this world <span class="add">I am</span> in pursuit of an answer to this question. Now will Venerable Kauṣṭhila <span class="add">please</span> talk with me about this matter? When will the amount of extreme suffering of those persons be over?” </p>
<p>Then Venerable Kauṣṭhila uttered these verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“The harvest of whatever is sown will not be the same, and<br>
The same holds true of sentient beings’ course of existence.<br>
With words I <span class="add">can</span>not do justice to one who realises<br>
Independently the <span class="add">ultimate</span> awakening.<br>
To attest <span class="add">ultimate</span> release by means of insight-knowledge<br>
Through contemplation <span class="add">one should have</span> actually<br>
Realised the super-knowledge of the <br>
Divine eye. <span class="add">In regard to someone<br>
Who</span> achieves the end of suffering once and for all,<br>
My words fail to do him justice.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thereupon Lady Sūṣas uttered the following verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“It is the Blessed One who has this <br>
Insight-knowledge and is genuinely without weakness and<br>
Blemish; <span class="add">those who</span> have heroic effort as<br>
Their support, look forward to practising <br>
in accordance with the Great Vehicle.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now once more Venerable Kauṣṭhila uttered verses as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Such a disposition is extremely rare, <br>
enabling <span class="add">one</span> to realise <br>
the wonderful essence of the Teaching. <br>
With words it is difficult to do justice to it—<br>
To this extraordinary subject-matter.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Venerable Kauṣṭhila then expanded on the essence of the Teaching for the sake of Lady Sūṣas which made her happy. In good time the lady rose from her seat, bowed down her head <span class="add">at the venerable one’s feet</span> and went away. After listening to Venerable Kauṣṭhila’s words, Lady Sūṣas was pleased and respectfully applied herself to practice.</p>
