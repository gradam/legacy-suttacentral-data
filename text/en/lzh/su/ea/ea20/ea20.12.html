<h1><span class="add">Cūḍapanthaka</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s <a class="t" id="t601a"></a> Park. Then the Venerable <span class="add">Mahā</span>panthaka said to his younger brother Cūḍapanthaka:</p>
<p>“If a person is unable to keep <span class="add">in mind</span> the rules of moral conduct, he should return to the <span class="add">lay life</span> and wear the white robe <span class="add">of a layman</span>.” </p>
<p>On hearing these words Cūḍapanthaka went out of the gate of Jeta<span class="add">vana</span> Monastery and stood aside weeping. While the monk was standing outside the gate, with his immaculate “divine eye” the Exalted One saw him beside himself and weeping bitterly. Rising from his quiet abiding and seemingly taking his walking-exercise, the Exalted One went out of the gate of Jeta<span class="add">vana</span> Monastery and asked Cūḍapanthaka, “Why, monk, are you weeping bitterly?” </p>
<p>“Exalted One,” replied Cūḍapanthaka, “My elder brother wants to expel me, <span class="add">saying</span> that if a person is unable to keep <span class="add">in mind</span> the rules of moral conduct, he should return to <span class="add">lay life</span> … and that he should not stay here. That is why I am weeping bitterly.” </p>
<p>“Do not be afraid, monk,” said the Exalted One, “<span class="add">I</span> will see to it that <span class="add">you</span> will realise the Highest, Full and Complete Enlightenment; you would not become enlightened due to your elder brother Panthaka.” </p>
<p>Then the Exalted One took Cūḍapanthaka by the hand, returned <span class="add">with him</span> to the <i>vihāra</i> and had him sitting down on the spot and holding a bamboo broom, <span class="add">saying to him</span>, “What do you call this <span class="add">object</span>? Pronounce the word for it.” </p>
<p>Now Cūḍapanthaka managed to pronounce “bamboo”, but he could not remember <span class="add">the word</span> “broom”, and while he managed to pronounce “broom”, he forgot <span class="add">the word</span> “bamboo”.</p>
<p>Venerable Cūḍapanthaka continued enunciating “bamboo broom” for several days. Consequently the defects in his pronouncing “bamboo broom” were gone, and he thought to himself, “What is this dispelling like, and what are defects like? There is a defect when there is grime on a slate <span class="add">roof, for instance</span>, and getting rid <span class="add">leads</span> to cleanliness.” </p>
<p>And again it occurred to him, “Why has the Exalted One given me this lesson? Now I should think about this matter.” </p>
<p>This train of thought occasioned further thinking, “Now there is also dirt on my body; I am myself an illustrative example; what is getting rid like, and what are impurities like?” </p>
<p>Then he reflected, “The impurities are the fetters of mental defilements, and getting rid corresponds to insight-knowledge. Just now I am able to sweep away these mental defilements with the broom of insight-knowledge.” </p>
<p>After <span class="add">these thoughts</span> Venerable Cūḍapanthaka wisely reflected on the five aggregates of grasping, on their appearance and disappearance, “This is form, <span class="add">this is</span> its arising and its cessation; this is feeling … perception … these are formative forces … and consciousness, its arising and its cessation.” </p>
<p>When he had wisely reflected on the five aggregates of grasping, his mind was freed from the malign influences of desire, of becoming and of ignorance. Having realised <span class="add">ultimate</span> freedom, he gained insight-knowledge of this freedom and knew in accordance with fact, “Birth and death have come to and end, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, and there will be no more coming into existence.”</p>
<p>Venerable Cūḍapanthaka became an <i>arhat</i> and, after his realisation of arhatship, he rose from his seat and went to where the Exalted One was. <span class="add">There</span> he bowed down his head <span class="add">at the Exalted One’s</span> feet, sat down at one side and said to him, “Just now insight-knowledge and wisdom have been won, and the bamboo broom <span class="add">problem</span> has been solved.” </p>
<p>“How, monk,” asked the Exalted One, “have you solved it?” </p>
<p>“Dispelling,” replied Cūḍapanthaka, “that is wisdom; and impurities are fetters.” </p>
<p>“Well said, monk,” the Exalted One approved, “It is as you say: dispelling is wisdom, impurities are fetters.” At that time Venerable Cūḍapanthaka addressed the following stanza to the Exalted One:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Hardly has this enunciating, as the Exalted One bade<br>
<span class="add">me</span> do, been finished than, through insight-knowledge,<br>
<span class="add">I</span> could dispel the fetters; no remnants of them that <br>
could affect <span class="add">me</span> are in operation any more.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Monk,” confirmed the exalted One, “as you say, because of insight-knowledge there are no remnants of them in operation any more.” </p>
<p>Having listened to the Exalted One’s words, Venerable <span class="add">Cūḍapanthaka</span> was pleased and respectfully applied himself to practice.</p>
