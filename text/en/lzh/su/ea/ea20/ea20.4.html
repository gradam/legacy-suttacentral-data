<h1><span class="supplied">Lions and Sheep</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then the Exalted One said to the monks:</p>
<p>“Now it is apposite for me to say <span class="supplied">the following</span>—there are persons who are like lions and those who are like sheep. Listen attentively and take heed of what <span class="supplied">I am going to say</span>.” </p>
<p>“We shall, Exalted One,” replied the monks. </p>
<p><span class="supplied">In order to</span> instruct them, the Exalted One went on, “How does a person resemble a lion? There is, <span class="supplied">for example,</span> a monk, someone who receives what is respectfully offered: robes, alms-food, lodging and medicine for treating the sick. Having received them and then enjoying them, attachment does not arise in his mind; neither thoughts of desire arise in him nor any <span class="supplied">wrong</span> perception. Not <span class="supplied">entertaining</span> any <span class="supplied">wrong</span> ideas whatsoever, he is absolutely certain about the Teaching conducive to emancipation. Even if he has to go without gains and favours, he is neither distracted nor does he experience elation and dejection. </p>
<p>“He is like the royal lion <span class="supplied">whenever the latter has</span> to make do with a small domestic animal <span class="supplied">as prey</span>. At that time the king of beasts, too, does not think, ‘This is good, that is bad’. Attachment does not arise in his mind; neither thoughts of desire arise in him nor <span class="supplied">wrong</span> perception. </p>
<p>“Similar is <span class="supplied">the behaviour</span> of this person: whenever he receives respectful offerings … attachment does not arise in his mind. Even if he does not receive anything, he does not entertain any <span class="supplied">wrong</span> ideas.</p>
<p>“Take for example someone who receives what people respectfully offer him: robes, alms-food, lodging, help and medicine for the sick. Having received and enjoyed them, attachment arises in his mind; thoughts of sensuous desire arise in him and he is absolutely oblivious of the path leading to emancipation. Should he receive nothing, he does not stop fretting. Having received respectful offerings, however, he boasts of himself and insults the other monks <span class="supplied">by saying</span>, ‘It is me who is fit to receive robes … medicine for the sick, whereas these monks are not.’</p>
<p>“<span class="supplied">Let us take</span> the simile of a single sheep in the midst of a large flock of sheep. Having separated itself from the flock, that sheep went to a large heap of dung. Having feasted on the faeces at a distance from the flock, it returned and boasting of itself, <span class="supplied">it insulted the other sheep by saying</span>, ‘I am fit to receive excellent food, these sheep are not.’</p>
<p>“Similarly, whenever the <span class="supplied">second type of person</span> receives gains and favours, robes … medicine for the sick, he loses his composure and attachment arises in his mind; then he boasts of himself <span class="supplied">while insulting</span> the <span class="supplied">other</span> monks <span class="supplied">by saying</span>, ‘I am fit to receive <a class="t" id="t600a"></a> respectful offerings, these monks are not.’</p>
<p>“Therefore, monks, you should train <span class="supplied">to be</span> like the royal lion and not like the sheep. Thus, O monks, you should train.” </p>
<p>“After listening to the Buddha’s words, the monks were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
