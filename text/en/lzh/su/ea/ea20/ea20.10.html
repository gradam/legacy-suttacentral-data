<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s <a class="t" id="t601a"></a> Park. Then the Exalted One said to the monks:</p>
<p>“There are two <span class="supplied">kinds of</span> practice by means of which an ordinary worldling obtains great merit, reaps outstanding karmic rewards, <span class="supplied">finally</span> tastes the Deathless and realises the state of the Unconditioned. Which are the two? </p>
<p>“a) Treating one’s father and mother with great respect; it is because of <span class="supplied">honouring</span> these two persons that one obtains great merit and reaps outstanding karmic rewards. And, furthermore, one obtains great merit and … rewards by </p>
<p>“b) Treating a bodhisattva who has to wait for only one more birth <span class="supplied">before realising Buddhahood</span> with great respect. </p>
<p>“It is, O monks, because of practising generosity towards these two <span class="supplied">groups of</span> persons that one obtains great merit … and finally realises the state of the Unconditioned. </p>
<p>“Therefore, monks, one should be mindful of one’s filial duty and treat one’s father and mother with great respect. Thus, O monks, you should train.” </p>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the monks were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
