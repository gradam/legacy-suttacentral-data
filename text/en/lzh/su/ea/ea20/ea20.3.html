<h1><span class="add">Dharmaruci’s Past Life</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. </p>
<p>Then the Exalted One was expounding the Teaching, surrounded by an audience <span class="add">consisting of</span> innumerable <span class="add">persons</span>. Simultaneously Dharmaruci was alone in his quiet room, reflecting wisely. Fully concentrated he entered the absorption<span class="add">s and then</span> contemplated he body <span class="add"> which he had to put up with in his</span> previous <span class="add">life</span>. In the middle of the Great Ocean it appeared in the shape of a fish that measured seven hundred yojanas. Just as a strong man instantly bends and <span class="add">again</span> stretches his arm, he immediately left his quiet room, proceeded to the middle of the Great Ocean and passed by rotten <span class="add">fish</span> carcass. On this occasion Dharmaruci uttered the following verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“<span class="add">There are</span> birth and death for countless aeons and <br>
<span class="add">The duration of one’s</span> wandering on in <i>saṃsāra</i> is <br>
Incalculable. Everybody is in search of happiness, and<br>
What is obtained is endless misery. Having seen again<br>
<span class="add">One’s former</span> body, how much less is there<br>
The need to create a <span class="add">new</span> frame!<br>
<span class="add">Once</span> all attachment has ceased, no further<br>
Physical frame will be found. <span class="add">Once</span> the heart<br>
Is not involved at all in any action <span class="add">pertaining to <br>
<i>Saṃsāra</i></span>, no more clinging will be left<br>
Behind—to say nothing of this kind of frame; <span class="add">for</span><br>
In Nirvāṇa there is surpassing happiness.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scarcely had Venerable Dharmaruci uttered these verses when he disappeared <span class="add">at the site of encountering the carcass</span>, shifted to Śrāvastī, to Jetavanavihāra, and went to where the Exalted One was. </p>
<p>On seeing Dharmaruci coming near, the Exalted One said, “Excellent, Dharmaruci! Here after a long time.” </p>
<p>“Indeed, Exalted One,” replied Dharmaruci, “Here after a long time”.</p>
<p>Since the Exalted One knew what the monks were thinking to themselves and wishing to dispel <span class="add">any possible</span> uncertainty <span class="add">on their part</span>, he said to them, “It is not because of Dharmaruci that I have made the remark ‘here after a long time’ <span class="add">and not ‘for a long time’</span>. <span class="add">I have made it for the following reasons:</span></p>
<p>“In the past, countless aeons ago, the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara had appeared in the world, the Fully and Completely Enlightened One, the Blessed One, perfect in insight-knowledge and good conduct, world-knowing, the supreme Dharma-charioteer, teacher of gods and men, the Buddha, the Bhagavat. He was on his way to the great kingdom <span class="add">known as</span> Padma, accompanied by a huge number of monks, viz altogether 148,000 persons. In those days the four assemblies were so numerous that they could neither be counted nor estimated. The country’s king, his ministers, civil servants, people from all social strata came forward <span class="add">with their contributions towards a</span> sacrifice in favour of those who are indispensable. </p>
<p>“At that time there was a brahmin by the name of Yajñnada who lived in the foothills of the Himālayas. As far as secret signs, astronomy and geography were concerned there was nothing he was not an expert in. He also was a past master at explaining scriptures and at scripts. Another speciality of his was the intonation of a sentence <span class="add">consisting of</span> five hundred words and also <span class="add">the science of describing</span> the marks of a great being. He taught five hundred disciples untiringly, day and night, the scriptures <span class="add">dealing with</span> Agni, Sūrya, Soma and the <span class="add">deities pertaining to other</span> heavenly bodies. </p>
<p>“The brahmin Yajñnada had a disciple whose name was Meghadundubhi, whose features betrayed a very respectable descent and the colour of whose hair was a light reddish-black. The brahmin Meghadundubhi was sagacious and far-seeing and <span class="add">,once he had embarked upon something,</span> there was nothing he could not bring to a successful end. Whenever he saw Yajñnada, he at once bowed to him his devotion and of all the sacrificial formulae which a brahmin applied in those days he had perfect command.</p>
<p>“Then the brahmin Meghadundubhi thought to himself, ‘Now all that is required studying I have fully mastered.’ And again it occurred to him, ‘He who<span class="add">se knowledge</span> surpasses all that is included in the lists of texts dealing with the sciences <span class="add">relevant to </span> a brahmin’s occupation, is <span class="add">my</span> teacher <span class="add">whose</span> kindness should be requited. As for myself, all that I had to study I have at present gained mastery of. Now I should requite my teacher’s kindness. However, being poor and without means enabling <span class="add">me</span> to make offerings to my teacher, <span class="add">I</span> should go off in all directions in search of the necessary means.’ </p>
<p>“After this <span class="add">musing</span> the brahmin Meghadundubhi went to the whereabouts of his teacher and said to him, ‘As for the teachings pertaining to the sciences and expertise of a brahmin, <span class="add">I</span> have mastered them now. As a matter of fact, he who<span class="add">se knowledge</span> surpasses all that is included in the lists of texts dealing with the <span class="add">brahminical</span> sciences and expertise, is <span class="add">my</span> teacher <span class="add">whose</span> kindness would be requited. However, being diligent and lacking gold, silver and <span class="add">other</span> precious things enabling <span class="add">me</span> to make offerings, now <span class="add">I</span> would like to go off in all directions to ask for assets enabling <span class="add">me</span> to make offerings to my teacher.’</p>
<p>“On <span class="add">hearing these words</span> the brahmin Yajñnada thought, ‘This brahmin Meghadundubhi who is dear to me is always on my mind. Thinking that <span class="add">one day</span> I shall die, I cannot <span class="add">bear the idea of our</span> being separated for ever, let alone <span class="add">the idea of his</span> intention to abandon me today and go away. Now how should I proceed in order to keep <span class="add">him</span> and make <span class="add">him</span> stay?’</p>
<p>“Then the brahmin Yajñnada said to Meghadundubhi, “O noble brahmin, for one reason you do not yet know what a brahmin should have studied.” </p>
<p>“In front of his teacher Meghadundubhi asserted, ‘The only thing I am intent on is the acquisition of knowledge. What is it I have not yet studied?’</p>
<p>“Instantly Yajñnada called to mind a recitation <span class="add">consisting of</span> five hundred words and told Meghadundubhi, ‘Now there exists a text entitled Panncaśatavākpāṭha. You may receive it.’</p>
<p>“‘I hope, Meghadundubhi replied, ‘the teacher will be <span class="add">so kind</span> as to instruct me; <span class="add">I</span> would like to obtain the recitation.’</p>
<p>“O monks, <span class="add">"the Exalted One interrupted his narrative, “</span> you should know that after <span class="add">Meghadundubhi’s request</span> Yajñnada taught this disciple <span class="add">of his</span> the Panncaśatavākpāṭha. Within just a few days <span class="add">the latter</span> became proficient <span class="add">at reciting the text until then unknown to him</span>. </p>
<p>“Thereafter the brahmin Yajñnada said to his five hundred disciples, ‘This brahmin Meghadundubhi is not really competent <span class="add">as far as</span> teaching methods and comprehensive knowledge <span class="add">are concerned</span>. This being the case, there is <span class="add">someone, however, who</span> has made a name for himself; his name is “He who Surpasses in Methods”, Nayātikrama. This brahmin Nayātikrama possesses a most remarkable talent for astronomy and geography, and there is nothing he is not an expert in. He is a past master at explaining scriptures and at scripts.’</p>
<p>“When several days had elapsed, the brahmin Nayātikrama went to his teacher and said, ‘Now <span class="add">I</span> am proficient in the methods of teaching the brahminical sciences. He who<span class="add">se knowledge</span> surpasses all that is included in the lists of texts treating the <span class="add">brahminical</span> sciences, is <span class="add">my</span> teacher <span class="add">whose</span> kindness, therefore, should be requited. <span class="add">But I have</span> to add that <span class="add">I</span> am poor, lacking gold, silver and <span class="add">other</span> precious things enabling <span class="add">me</span> to make offerings to my teacher. Now I would like to go off in all directions in search of assets to attain my goal. If only <span class="add">I could</span> get permission <span class="add">to do so</span>.’</p>
<p>“‘As you think fit,’ replied the brahmin Yajñnada. The brahmin Nayātikrama bowed down <span class="add">his head</span> at his teacher’s feet, stepped backwards and left. </p>
<p>“In those days not far from the <span class="add">man</span> town of the great kingdom <span class="add">known as</span> Padma a huge number of brahmins had gathered at one place, viz, 84,0000 brahmins, in order to participate in a great sacrifice and to discuss doctrinal matters. The chief <span class="add">of all those brahmins assembled</span> was supposed to be well-versed in the outsiders’ chanting and explaining scriptures, knowledge about astronomy and geography and a past master at <span class="add">explaining</span> extraordinary <span class="add">phenomena such as</span> changes in the constellations. Everybody was eagerly occupied with amassing five hundred ounces of gold, one golden staff, one golden jug for ablutions and one thousand head of cattle <span class="add">to be</span> presented to the foremost teacher <span class="add">to be</span> ranked as the most <span class="add">learned among all the brahmins</span>. </p>
<p>“<span class="add">Near the border,</span> not far from the great kingdom <span class="add">known as</span> Padma the brahmin Nayātikrama heard that all the brahmins, viz. 84,000 <span class="add">persons</span>, had gathered at one place, that their proficiency was being tested <span class="add">to find out who would</span> rank foremost so as to be given the five hundred ounces of gold … and the large <span class="add">herd of</span> one thousand head of cattle. </p>
<p>“Then it occurred to the brahmin Nayātikrama, ‘Now why do I beg from house to house? <span class="add">I</span> had better go to that enormous gathering to participate in the proficiency contest.’</p>
<p>“So the brahmin Nayātikrama went to the venue of that giant assembly. When the large multitude of brahmins saw the brahmin Nayātikrama coming from afar, they all shouted at the top of their voices, ‘Excellent! <span class="add">This is the real</span> chief of the sacrifice <span class="add">gathering</span>. Now <span class="add">this function</span> proves immensely useful—so much so that Brahmā is descending in person.’</p>
<p>“All the 84,000 brahmins rose and went to receive <span class="add">him</span>. With one accord <span class="add">they</span> cheered, ‘Welcome Great Brahmā!’ Being <span class="add">accorded such tribute,</span> the brahmin Nayātikrama thought, ‘These brahmins take me to be Brahmā; but I am not Brahmā.’</p>
<p>“So the brahmin Nayātikrama addressed the brahmins with the <span class="add">following</span> words, ‘Please stop, noble ones! Do not call me Brahmā! Have you not heard of Yajñnada, teacher of so many brahmins <span class="add">living</span> in the north, in the Himālayas, <span class="add">whose</span> mastery of astrology and geography <span class="add">is such that</span> there is nothing <span class="add">he</span> does not <span class="add">know</span>?’</p>
<p>“The brahmins replied, ‘We have heard of him, but we have never seen <span class="add">him</span>.’</p>
<p>“‘I am,’ the brahmin Nayātikrama introduced himself, ‘his disciple Nayātikrama by name.’</p>
<p>“Then the brahmin Nayātikrama turned toward the chief of that mammoth assembly and said, ‘How about an expert’s showing me his expertise?’</p>
<p>“Now the chief of that gathering impeccably recited to the brahmin Nayātikrama the <span class="add">texts of</span> the Three Collections. After that the Brahmin Nayātikrama again asked the chief, ‘Are <span class="add">you</span> able to recite the Sentence <span class="add">Consisting of</span> Five Hundred Words?’</p>
<p>“‘I do not know what <span class="add">you</span> mean’ replied the chief, ‘what is the Sentence <span class="add">Consisting of</span> Five Hundred Words like?’</p>
<p>“‘O noble ones,’ requested the brahmin Nayātikrama, ‘please listen attentively; <span class="add">I</span> will recite the Sentence <span class="add">Consisting of</span> Five Hundred Words <span class="add">describing</span> the marks of a great being.’</p>
<p>“O bikkhus<span class="add">”, said the Exalted One</span>, “you should know that on that occasion the brahmin Nayātikrama <span class="add">showed his</span> proficiency in reciting the texts of the Three Collections and the Sentence <span class="add">Consisting of</span> Five Hundred Words <span class="add">describing</span> the marks of a great being. The 84,000 brahmins, overjoyed as never before, we all <span class="add">agreed</span> that this was the first time for them to listen to the Sentence <span class="add">Consisting of</span> Five Hundred Words <span class="add">describing</span> the marks of a great being and that as from that moment ‘the Venerable’ <span class="add">Nayātikrama</span> should be ranked foremost and be <span class="add">their</span> chief.</p>
<p>“When the brahmin Nayātikrama had risen from his seat and again sat down on the seat reserved for the chief <span class="add">of the assembly</span>, he very much disliked his having been ranked foremost in that gathering. <span class="add">He thought to himself with regard to</span> the vows <span class="add">formerly</span> taken by him, ‘These people have made me move to another seat so as to fill the vacancy. Now that I have made known <span class="add">my</span> scriptural authority, it will be difficult <span class="add">for me</span> to keep up my practice. Supposing there is a really virtuous person who wholeheartedly keeps his vows; he performs actions <span class="add">in conformity with</span> places he hopes to be born in. I <span class="add">would</span> in fact destroy for good the virtue <span class="add">resulting from my brahminical studies and practice should I become attached to name and fame</span>.’</p>
<p>“Then the person in charge of the munificence <span class="add">function</span> provided five hundred ounces of gold, one golden staff, one golden jug and one beautiful girl. <span class="add">He</span> handed over <span class="add">these various yajña ingredients</span> to the <span class="add">new</span> chairman by felicitating him with a sacred formula. </p>
<p>“‘Herewith,’ said the chairman to the person in charge of the munificence <span class="add">function</span>, ‘I accept the five hundred ounces of gold, the golden staff and jug for ablutions in order to offer them to my master fo his support. As to the girl and the one thousand head of cattle, <span class="add">they may</span> be returned to your people because I do not need them, and I do not have the habit of amassing property.’</p>
<p>“After receiving <span class="add">the five ounces of gold</span>, he golden staff and jug, the brahmin Nayātikrama entered the great kingdom <span class="add">known as </span> Padma. The name of its king was Dīpa. As the ruler of the country he had invited the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara and a <span class="add">large</span> multitude of his monks to an offering of robes and <span class="add">alms-</span>food. </p>
<p>“In the <span class="add">main</span> city of that kingdom the king issued the order that no fragrant flowers should be sold by any of its inhabitants. Any one selling them would incur severe punishment. Even if he himself too the liberty of buying <span class="add">flowers</span> it should not be compulsory to bypass <span class="add">the order</span> and sell them. </p>
<p>“Again he had the people clean up <span class="add">all places</span>, sweep and sprinkle them <span class="add">with water</span>. Fouled earth and sand had to be removed. Silken banners and canopies were fluttering <span class="add">in the wind</span>, perfumed water was showered on the ground; <span class="add">all these</span> preparations created <span class="add">and atmosphere of tidiness and serenity</span> to which sensual pleasures do not bear comparison. </p>
<p>“Witnessing <span class="add">these ongoing preparations</span>, the brahmin <span class="add">Nayātikrama</span> asked <span class="add">some</span> passers-by, ‘<span class="add">All places</span> are being swept and sprinkled <span class="add">with water</span>, roads are being cleared of refuse, silken banners and canopies are fluttering <span class="add">in the wind</span>; <span class="add">this atmosphere of tidiness and serenity</span> is incomparable! What special even is it? It is <span class="add">certainly</span> not the crown prince, heir to the throne, who is going to marry his graceful <span class="add">bride</span>.’</p>
<p>“The passers-by were wondering ‘Does the brahmin not know it?’ They <span class="add">went on</span> to say, ‘For today the kind of the great Padma kingdom has invited the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara, the fully and Completely Enlightened One, to an offering of robes ands <span class="add">alms-</span>food. For this very reason the roads are being cleared of refuse, silken banners and canopies are fluttering <span class="add">in the wind</span>.’</p>
<p>“<span class="add">On hearing</span> this <span class="add">news</span> the brahmin <span class="add">Nayātikrama</span> uttered these words, pregnant with meaning, which he had memorised, ‘It is extremely rare for a Tathāgata to appear in the world, and <span class="add">since</span> he appears only occasionally <span class="add">after immense intervals of time</span>, it is practically impossible to see him. It is exceedingly rare for a Tathāgata to appear in the world—as rare as the udumbara flower blossoming only occasionally <span class="add">after immense intervals of time</span>. It is extremely rare for two persons to appear in the world. For which two persons? It is extremely rare for a Tathāgata and for a noble universal monarch to appear in the world.’</p>
<p>“Then the following thought occurred to him, ‘Now I could requite the Buddha’s favour at once by respectfully by offering Him, the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara, the five ounces of gold.’</p>
<p>“And again it came to his mind, ‘According to what the scriptures say, a Tathāgata neither accepts gold and silver nor <span class="add">other</span> precious things. I could instead use the five hundred ounces of gold to buy fragrant flowers.’</p>
<p>“The passers-by were also wondering, ‘Does the brahmin not know it?’ They <span class="add">went on</span> to say, ‘Our king has issued an order that anyone selling fragrant flowers should be punished severely.’ </p>
<p>“The brahmin Nayātikrama was at a loss and thought, ‘<span class="add">I</span> just do not know how to get flowers.’</p>
<p>Having <span class="add">decided</span> to return and having left the city, he stayed outside the gates <span class="add">of the city</span>. There was a brahmin girl named Susvādā, carrying a water jug so as to fetch water. On seeing that girl the brahmin said to her, ‘Distinguished younger sister, I need flowers and hope the younger sister will be kind enough to sell them to me.’</p>
<p>“‘<span class="add">Since</span> when,’ replied the brahmin girl, ‘am I your younger sister? You do not <span class="add">even</span> know who are my parents.’</p>
<p>“‘The girl is really good-hearted,’ the brahmin thought to himself. ‘She just wants to make fun <span class="add">of me</span>.’ </p>
<p>“Again he said <span class="add">to her</span>, ‘Good girl, will you kindly <span class="add">sell me</span> these flowers at any price.’</p>
<p>“‘Do you not know,’ replied the brahmin girl, ‘that his Majesty has prohibited the sale of flowers?’</p>
<p>“‘Good girl,’ said the brahmin, ‘as for that matter, do not be concerned. What has the king to do with you? I urgently need these five flowers, and you will have got a good bargain.’</p>
<p>“‘What are you going to do with the flowers so urgently needed by you?’ asked the brahmin girl. </p>
<p>“The brahmin <span class="add">replied</span>, ‘I <span class="add">can</span> see there is fertile ground that needs to be cultivated <span class="add">by means of</span> these flowers <span class="add">for growing roots of merit</span>.’</p>
<p>“The brahmin girl <span class="add">said</span>, ‘These flowers have been cut off from their roots; so they can by no means strike <span class="add">root</span> again. How can <span class="add">you</span> say you want to grow them?’</p>
<p>“The brahmin <span class="add">again replied</span>, ‘Today, for instance, I see a fertile field to be cultivated; though bleak and bare <span class="add">things</span> grow in it again and again. All the more <span class="add">fertile is the field in which roots of merit can be cultivated by dint of</span> these flowers.’</p>
<p>“The brahmin girl <span class="add">asked</span>, ‘What is this fertile field like in which, though bleak and bare, <span class="add">after</span> cultivation <span class="add">things</span> grow?’</p>
<p>“The brahmin <span class="add">replied</span>, ‘Good girl, the Buddha, the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara, the Fully and Completely Enlightened One, has appeared in the world.’</p>
<p>“The girl: ‘What is the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara like?’</p>
<p>“The brahmin: ‘The Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara whose merit is perfect, is endowed with such<span class="add">-and-such</span> virtues and such<span class="add">-and-such</span> conduct.’</p>
<p>“The girl: ‘What kind of merit does a virtuous person strive for?’</p>
<p>“The brahmin: ‘I am filled with aspiration to become, like the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara, fully and completely enlightened in a future existence, being <span class="add">endowed with</span> virtues and conduct like him.’</p>
<p>“The girl: ‘If you promise to accept me as your wife existence after existence I shall give you the flowers.’</p>
<p>“The brahmin: ‘As for my behaviour, now my mind is free from clinging.’</p>
<p>“The girl: ‘Let me be your wife in future existences just as now I do not desire to be your wife physically.’</p>
<p>“The brahmin Nayātikrama: ‘A bodhisattva’s manner of conduct excludes sparing oneself. If you want to be my wife <span class="add">you</span> should overcome selfish attachment.’</p>
<p>“The girl: ‘I will by no means betray your aspiring generosity. Let me with right motivation make use of my body, donating it to others. <span class="add">Thus</span> I will not betray <span class="add">our aspiring after generosity.’</span></p>
<p>“Then <span class="add">the brahmin Nayātikrama</span> took the five hundred gold coins and bought with them the flowers. After both <span class="add">he himself</span> and that girl had vowed <span class="add">to embark on a bodhisattva’s practice</span> they parted company.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara, the Fully and Completely Enlightened One, had put on his <span class="add">outer</span> robes and taken up his alms-bowl. Heading the monks accompanying <span class="add">him</span> in order of seniority, he entered the great Padma kingdom. Seeing him some distance away, an <span class="add">inspiring</span> appearance of genuine modesty, the brahmin Nayātikrama was not disappointed. The Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara’s bearing was calm and dignified. He was possessed of the thirty-two <span class="add">primary</span> and the eight secondary marks of an extraordinary being. <span class="add">On seeing him one was</span> reminded of pellucid water free of all turbidity, allowing the light to penetrate without hindrance. Again, <span class="add">he</span> resembled a jewel mountain surpassing <span class="add">other</span> mountains. </p>
<p>“Having <span class="add">this</span> experience, the brahmin Nayātikrama became elated. Holding the five flowers meant for the Tathāgata, he went to where Dīpaṃkara was an stood at one side; then he said to Buddha Dīpaṃkara, ‘It is hoped that something will be obtained. Supposing the Exalted One decides not to impart anything, then it would be preferable to put an end to one’s life on the spot. It would not be worth living on.’</p>
<p>“‘Brahmin,’ said the Exalted One, ‘it is not possible thanks to these five flowers to impart the Complete and HIghest Enlightenment.’</p>
<p>“‘I <span class="add">only</span> hope,’ replied the brahmin, ‘the Exalted One will be so kind as to teach me how to embark on a a bodhisattva’s practice.’</p>
<p>“‘A bodhisattva’s practice,’ explained the Buddha Dīpaṃkara, ‘excludes one’s sparing oneself.’ On this occasion the brahmin uttered the following verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“‘No<span class="add">body</span> dares take hold of his parents and give them<br>
Away to other people. The Buddhas, too, surpassing<br>
<span class="add">Other</span> wise persons, dare not give away<br>
<span class="add">Their parents</span>. Sun and moon circling earth—<br>
These two cannot be given away either. Everything else<br>
Can be given away, it will not be difficult<br>
To make up one’s mind <span class="add">to do so</span>.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Then also the Buddha Dīpaṃkara addressed the brahmin with these verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“‘The way you talk about giving away is not the Tathāgata’s <br>
<span class="add">Way</span> to talk about. <span class="add">A boddhisattva</span> should be <span class="add">prepared to</span><br>
Put up with a hundred million aeons of great<br>
Hardship <span class="add">involving</span> the giving away of one’s<br>
Head, trunk, ears, eyes, one’s wife, children, one’s <br>
Realm, treasures, carriages, horses, servants and <br>
Retinue. If <span class="add">you</span> can bear all this, then you <br>
May make <span class="add">your</span> resolution.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Even so, the young brahmin uttered these verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“‘The high mountain <span class="add">of great hardship</span> burning like<br>
Fire—for a hundred million aeons <span class="add">I</span> will put up <br>
With carrying it on <span class="add">my</span> head. <span class="add">My</span> aspiring for<br>
<span class="add">Supreme</span> enlightenment shall not be<br>
Impaired. All <span class="add">I</span> wish now is to make <span class="add">my</span> resolution.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Now the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara kept silent, and the brahmin, holding in his hand the five flowers, knelt down with his right knee on the ground and scattered <span class="add">the flowers</span> over the Tathāgata. In doing this he said, ‘<span class="add">May</span> this <span class="add">action</span> be conducive to having merit also in a future existence. Not unlike the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara, I shall realise Full and Complete Enlightenment.’</p>
<p>“On the spot he let down <span class="add">his long</span> hair, spread it on a muddy <span class="add">section of</span> road and said, ‘If the Tathāgata approves of my resolution <span class="add">He</span> may kindly cross <span class="add">the muddy section</span> by stepping on my hair.’</p>
<p>“O monks, <span class="add">said the Exalted One</span> you should know that the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara looked into the brahmin’s mind and scrutinised what he was thinking. Then he said to the brahmin, ‘In a future existence you will realise Full and Complete Enlightenment and become the Tathāgata Śākyamuni Buddha.’</p>
<p>“At <span class="add">that</span> time a fellow student of the brahmin Nayātikrama, Dharmaruci by name, stood next to the Tathāgata. Witnessing the Buddha Dīpaṃkara’s approval of the brahmin Nayātikrama’s resolution by stepping on <span class="add">the latter’s</span> hair, he remonstrated, ‘How can this shaveling of a Śramaṇa be so impudent as to trample on this pure brahmin’s hair? This not a <span class="add">civilised</span> man’s behaviour!’</p>
<p>“As for the brahmin Yajñnada of those days <span class="add">asked the Buddha of the monks</span>, do you think he was altogether a unique person? Do not regard him as such because the person of that time <span class="add">known as</span> Yajñnada is none other than Śuddhodana. As for the <span class="add">former</span> chief of the <span class="add">assembly of</span> 84,000 brahmins, he is none other than Devadatta, and I was at that time that very brahmin Nayātikrama. As far as the brahmin girl of those days is concerned who sold the flowers, she is now Gopī, and the person in charge of the yajña <span class="add">function</span> is none other than the brahmin Daṇḍapāṇi. </p>
<p>“Dharmaruci who hurled abusive language <span class="add">at the Tathāgata</span> in those days is in fact the Dharmaruci of today. For innumerable aeons this Dharmaruci was again and again born as a domestic animal, and in his <span class="add">second but</span> last life he took on the body of a fish that measured seven hundred yojanas, living in the Great Ocean. That existence having come to an end, he was born here <span class="add">again as a human being</span>. </p>
<p>“By always being close to a spiritual friend, by relying on a spiritual friend one habituates oneself to karmically wholesome actions conducing to the <span class="add">spiritual</span> faculties, to the gates <span class="add">of deliverance</span> and to supernormal knowledge. </p>
<p>“It is for this reason that I have said, ‘Here after a long time.’ And Dharmaruci, too , expressed himself, ‘Indeed, Exalted One, here after a long time.’</p>
<p>“Thus, O monks, you should constantly cultivate <span class="add">mindfulness</span> with regard to physical, vocal and mental actions. Thus, O monks, you should train.” </p>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the monks were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
