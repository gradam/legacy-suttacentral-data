<h1>2.59 Memory and Mindfulness</h1>
</div>
<p>The king again asked Nāgasena, “Why does one recollect what is past and done long ago?”</p>
<p>Nāgasena replied, “When a man is sorrowful, he recollects the things that took place in the distant past.”</p>
<p>“How does he recollect it, by the mind or by the memory?”</p>
<p>“Do you recollect business that you have done in the past?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have learned something, but later I forgot it.”</p>
<p>“At that time, great king, were you without a mind and thus have forgotten?”</p>
<p>“At that time, I was without mindfulness.”</p>
<p>“So then, great king, you have mindfulness.” said Nāgasena.</p>
<p>The king again asked Nāgasena, “Is there mindfulness when a man does something, be it in the past or present? Are all things known by mindfulness?”</p>
<p>“The past things are remembered by memory, and the present things are also remembered by memory.”</p>
<p>“Thus people only remember past things, but can’t they remember new things?”</p>
<p>“If things newly done cannot be remembered, then there is no mindfulness.”</p>
<p>“Do people who newly learn books and crafts remember?”</p>
<p>“People who newly learn books and arts have memory. So the disciples who have learned would know. Therefore there is memory.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
